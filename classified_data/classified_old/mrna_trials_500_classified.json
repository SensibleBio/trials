    "classification": "VERIFICATION: This is not an eligible mRNA interventional trial. The trial does not involve an mRNA-based medicine or therapeutic; instead, it focuses on a combination of Selinexor, Pegaspargase, and Dexamethasone for the treatment of NK/T-cell lymphoma. None of these components are mRNA-based therapies.\n\nCLASSIFICATION: N/A\n\nRATIONALE: The trial does not meet the criteria for an mRNA-based intervention as it does not involve mRNA encoding any therapeutic molecules. The treatment regimen consists of Selinexor, Pegaspargase, and Dexamethasone, which are not mRNA-based medicines but rather small molecules or proteins used in chemotherapy.\n\nKEY INDICATORS: Selinexor, Pegaspargase, Dexamethasone, NK/T-cell lymphoma, oral regimen",

    "brief_title": "Study of a Human Metapneumovirus/Respiratory Syncytial Virus mRNA Vaccine Candidate Encapsulated in a Lipid Nanoparticle-based Formulation in Adults Aged 60 Years and Older",
    "classification": "VERIFICATION: This is an eligible mRNA interventional trial.\n\nCLASSIFICATION: [6] Infectious Disease Vaccines\n\nRATIONALE: The trial involves the evaluation of a human metapneumovirus (hMPV) / respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) mRNA vaccine candidate encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) based formulation for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by hMPV and/or RSV in adults aged 60 years and older. The study aims to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate, select the optimal dose for future development, and evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster vaccination. These objectives align with the development of an infectious disease vaccine targeting viral pathogens. The focus on immunization, prevention of respiratory infections, and evaluation of immune responses supports the classification of this trial as an Infectious Disease Vaccine study.\n\nKEY INDICATORS:\n1. Evaluation of safety and immunogenicity of hMPV/RSV mRNA vaccine candidate in adults aged 60 years and older.\n2. Assessment of vaccine formulations for future development and selection of optimal dose.\n3. Administration of booster vaccination 12 months post-primary vaccination to evaluate safety and immunogenicity.\n4. Prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by hMPV and/or RSV in the study population.",

It focuses on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, not mRNA-based treatments.\n\nCLASSIFICATION: Not applicable\n\nRATIONALE: The trial does not involve mRNA-based therapeutics; instead, it focuses on evaluating the efficacy and safety of withdrawing tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. TKIs are small molecules that inhibit specific tyrosine kinases, which are not mRNA-based therapies.\n\nKEY INDICATORS: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, chronic myeloid leukemia, dose reduction, deep molecular remission, pharmacological history.",
