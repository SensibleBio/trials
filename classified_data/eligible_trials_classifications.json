Despite optimized standard of care treatment median survival and prognosis remain poor with a median survival of only 15% and five year survival after diagnosis of 5%.\n\nIn this single arm single centre phase I/II trial the investigators will determine the overall and progression free survival of patients with newly diagnosed GBM when autologous WT1 mRNA loaded dendritic cell vaccination is added to standard of care treatment. During recruitment, the investigators will include 20 patients with newly diagnosed, histologically verified glioblastoma (WHO grade IV) who have received a total or subtotal resection of the tumor. Patients who underwent prior radiation or chemotherapy or with a history of other malignancy will be excluded. In addition to standard of care consisting of adjuvant chemoradiation with temozolomide and temozolomide maintenance patients will receive an intradermal vaccination with autologous WT1 mRNA-loaded dendritic cells commencing 1 week after radiotherapy. The dendritic cell therapy product will be generated and administered in the Antwerp University Hospital, more specifically the Center for Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine (CCRG), headed by Prof. Zwi Berneman and the Division of Hematology.\n\nRecruitment began in December 2015 and is intended to continue until the end of 2024 or when 20 patients are enrolled. After a follow-up period (until 90 days after final DC vaccine administration or 24 months after apheresis , whichever occurs later), overall and progression free survival analysis will be performed and this will be compared with the published data of standard of care treatment without vaccination. In addition the investigators will look for feasibility, incidence of adverse events and immunogenicity.",

Briefly, the study aims to generate high-quality evidence on the immunogenicity and safety of alternative COVID-19 booster strategies against SARS-CoV-2 for IC people in Australia.\n\nTo do this, participants who have previously completed 3- to 6-doses of Australian TGA approved COVID-19 vaccines (BA.4/5 Moderna and Pfizer vaccines) will be randomised 1:1 to receive either one or two doses of a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine, as these become available in Australia. And additional arm can be added if an additional suitable vaccine becomes available. Namely, patients will be randomised to receive either one or two doses of bivalent Moderna or Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. As additional bivalent vaccines become available in Australia, these will be included in the trial, as additional arms. The trial can incorporate up to three arms at one time.\n\nPatients will be followed up for 455 days post randomisation.

    "detailed_description": "Lymph nodes are secondary lymphoid organs essential for the establishment of the germinal center reaction, allowing the generation of long-lived B cell memory and high-affinity antibodies. In order to investigate whether a germinal center response occurs following vaccine boost and to characterize it based on the type of vaccine received, we aim to analyze Spike and/or RBD-specific germinal center B cells within the draining lymph nodes. Accessing germinal center through fine needle aspirations under ultrasound guidance has recently emerged as an innovative strategy in the United States to investigate vaccine response. This procedure under local anesthesia is well-tolerated, and no major side effects have been reported in a hundred patients who underwent fine needle aspiration. The technical details for performing this examination are now well-described.\n\nOur previous work has highlighted the importance of repertoire diversity in responding to new variants of SARS-CoV-2. We thus aim to investigate whether a booster dose with mRNA or protein-based vaccine mobilizes memory B cells or naive cells, thereby contributing to a greater diversity of the Memory B cell comportment. To preserve the diversity of the memory B cell pool is absolutely essential for our immune system to adapt against variants.\n\nTo achieve this, we will perform lymph node fine needle aspiration of the draining lymph node in 6 subjects in each study arm, 3 to 6 weeks after the booster vaccine injection. Indeed, it has been shown that the response of germinal centers in response to a booster vaccination was detectable at 2- and 8-weeks post-injection vaccination.\n\nThis outpatient procedure will be performed by a radiologist under ultrasound guidance, aiming to collect 4 fine needle aspirations from 4 axillary draining lymph nodes under local anesthesia. Concurrently, a 35 mL blood sample will be collected from the subject to correlate the response in secondary lymphoid organs with the circulating response.",

    "detailed_description": "A novel zoonotic coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) mid-December 2019 and was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus rapidly spread to the rest of the world, including Europe and explicitly affects the respiratory system, generating Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\nUZ Brussel employees presenting symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 are offered to be tested with real-time PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. As asymptomatic infections have been described and as the PCR can be negative when taken late after onset of symptoms, serologic tests can be performed. The SARS-CoV 2003 epidemic demonstrated that serological assays were a useful diagnostic tool of non-acute infections. Although it is still uncertain whether convalescing patients have a risk of re-infection, recent data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could protect at least for some time from subsequent viral exposures.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic had devastating medical, economic and social consequences, safe and effective prophylactic vaccines were urgently needed. And thus several candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been developed. During the first weeks of the vaccination campaign, the health care workers of the UZ Brussel, were invited to receive the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine.\n\nConsequently, the investigators aim to prospectively document the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and seroconversion among vaccinated employees of the UZ Brussel, at three different time points, namely 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks; T1), 6 months (+/- 1 month; T2) and 12 months (+/- 1 month; T3) after the second vaccination.",

    "detailed_description": "Background: The accrual of population immunity to COVID-19 could allow life to return to pre- pandemic normality. Immunity can be acquired through natural infections or, preferably, by vaccination. An unprecedented global effort has succeeded in developing a number of COVID-19 vaccines. All vaccines against COVID-19 approved until now have originally been developed as either a single dose or following a homologous two-dose regimen. Inactivated COVID-19 vaccines have shown inferior immunogenicity compared to mRNA vaccines but there are no studies looking into the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety profile of mRNA vaccination provided as a booster dose in individuals who have previously received two doses of an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nAims and Objectives: The aims of this study are: (1) to determine whether one dose of mRNA vaccine can boost neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in individuals who have previously received two doses of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines, and (2) to assess the reactogenicity and safety of heterologous 3rd doses of vaccination. The specific primary objective of this study is to assess the vaccine (humoral) immunogenicity, proxy by SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing antibody titers, of a 3rd dose dose of mRNA vaccine (using BNT162b2, Fosun/BioNTech) at 28 days after the booster dose in individuals who have previously received two doses of any inactivated COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nStudy design: Open label trial in adults aged 30 years of age or older (at enrolment). The duration of participation for each participant will be 12 months from the administration of the 3rd vaccine dose. The immune response and reactogenicity of one dose of BNT162b2 will be investigated in individuals who previously received two doses of any inactivated COVID-19 vaccines at least 3 months earlier. Participants will be enrolled shortly before receiving the booster dose of BNT162b2 (day 0), with blood collection at days 0, 28, 182 and 365 days after enrolment for analysis of humoral immune responses.\n\nMain outcomes: The primary outcome is the vaccine immunogenicity measured as SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing antibodies in individuals who previously received two doses of any inactivated COVID-19 vaccines, evaluated as the geometric mean titer (GMT) at 28 days after the 3rd dose. The secondary outcomes include (1) a comparison of SARS- CoV-2 serum neutralizing antibodies as the geometric mean fold rise from baseline to each post-vaccination timepoint (i.e. at days 28, 182 and 365), and (2) descriptive analysis of the reactogenicity and safety profile of the 3rd dose.\n\nTarget population: Adults aged 30 years or older\n\nNumber of Subjects Planned: 300 participants to be recruited between September 2021 and December 2021\n\nStudy duration: 12 months for each participant\n\nPotential implications: This study will provide important evidence into the effects of using a 3rd dose of mRNA vaccines to boost the immune response in individuals that had previously received two doses of inactivated vaccines. This information together with data collected on reactogenicity and safety could inform COVID-19 vaccination policy locally and internationally.",

    "brief_summary": "It is important people receiving immunosuppressive therapy are provided with the best protection against COVID-19 because they are at greater risk of severe illness should they become infected. As severe immunosuppression can reduce the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination, doctors agree that COVID-19 boosters is are important to maximise the vaccine response in these people. However, we don't currently know the best time to give booster vaccines to people about to start immunosuppressive therapy. This research aims to address this knowledge gap by examining whether the greatest protection is provided by giving the COVID-19 booster just before the immunosuppressive therapy starts or by waiting and giving the booster 6 months after treatment start. At the 6-month timepoint, in many cases the more intensive immunosuppression is often weaning and the immune system is starting to rebuild.",
    "detailed_description": "Current guidelines for SARS-CoV2 vaccination in immunosuppressed populations are based on limited evidence. Additionally, guidelines for the use of SARS-CoV2 vaccines in autoimmune populations are somewhat contradictory, with the 2019 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations including advice to where possible administer booster vaccinations prior to commencing immunosuppression but to preferably vaccinate while the autoimmune disease is not active. In haematological conditions it is suggested that vaccination occur prior to B cell depletion therapies e.g. rituximab, or \\>6 months after its use. While these guidelines were developed for non-live vaccines in general, the evidence for COVID-19 vaccines is almost entirely based on expert opinion. Clearly, with these gaps and inconsistencies in the clinical guidelines there is equipoise for the optimal timing of a booster vaccination. One of the difficulties in this field is the wide diversity of patients receiving a variety of immunosuppressive therapies. We have therefore taken a pragmatic 'real-world' approach in our design by focusing on two broad patient groups that are more specifically stratify based on pre-define disease conditions and specific treatments.\n\nRecent data studying COVID-19 vaccine responses in patients on immunosuppressive therapies for autoimmune/inflammatory conditions demonstrate the greatest compromise in anti-Spike IgG occurs in those receiving combination immunosuppression particularly regimens that include methotrexate and other antimetabolites, and B cell depleting therapies. In patients with haematological malignancies the lowest vaccine responses were seen in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. In patients with a haematological malignancy who have undergone a bone marrow transplant, immunisation to COVID-19 \\<6 months following transplantation resulted in poor IgG response to vaccine, while those immunised \\>6 months post-transplant had superior responses. In contrast, other targeted therapies including the integrin inhibitor vedoluzimab or anti IL-17/23 therapy (in the absence of concurrent methotrexate) have relatively preserved response to the initial vaccine regimen. Given the available data, we propose to study defined populations of two major immunosuppressed patient groups: Group 1): Haematological Malignancy (excluding bone marrow transplant recipients) and Autoimmune/Inflammatory Disease, and Group 2: Autologous and Allogeneic Bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. We will compare the difference between an immediate COVID-19 \"booster\" dose and a deferred COVID-19 \"booster\". In Group 1 \"Immediate\" is defined as prior to the commencement of moderate-to-severe immunosuppression and \"Deferred\" is defined as 6 months post commencement of moderate-to-severe immunosuppression. For Group 2 BMT patients, current national guidelines recommend 3 doses of pre-BMT COVID-19 vaccines followed by 3 doses of post-BMT COVID-19 vaccines initiated 6 months post-BMT. In Group 2 \"Immediate\" is defined as 6 months post-BMT and \"Deferred\" as \\>12 months post-BMT.\n\nThe primary endpoint will be the integrated area under the curve (AUC) of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) activity over the first year of immunosuppression. At present the level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 is the most robust correlate of protection against COVID-19. In both study Groups the comparator of a delayed boost at 6 months is based on the premise of maximising peak NAb responses by administering the booster after induction therapy is completed. Such a delay must be weighed against the risk of reduced immunity and breakthrough COVID-19 infection during this period. Such a risk will be monitored closely during the study with scheduled interim safety analyses and reviews by an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB).\n\nParticipants in Group 1 will also receive a single diphtheria/tetanus (dT) toxoid booster as a comparator vaccine with the aim of determining whether the results of the optimal timing of the COVID-19 booster also apply to more traditional protein vaccines. If this is found to be the case, the results of this study may have broader implications for the vaccinology field and optimal clinical guidelines.\n\nPrimary Objective: to determine the anti-SARS-CoV-2 NAb response over 12 months from a booster with a SARS-CoV2 vaccine over 12 months in a population who; Group 1: are commencing moderate-to-severe immunosuppression for treatment of either a haematological malignancy (excluding BMT patients) or an autoimmune/inflammatory condition and are previously fully-immunised (i.e. had received 3 or more doses of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine including combinations) or, Group 2: have recently undergone a bone marrow transplant for a haematological malignancy and have previously received 3 post-BMT doses of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine including combinations.\n\nWe will determine the difference between the booster being administered as follows: Group 1: immediately prior to starting moderate-to-severe immunosuppression or at 6 months after therapy start, by monitoring the relative sustained immunogenicity over 1 year. Group 2: immediately at 6-months post-BMT or deferred until \\>12 months post-BMT.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. To assess a range of secondary immunological endpoints including:\n\n   1. . To quantitate antibodies to tetanus toxoid integrated over the 12-month period post-randomisation.\n   2. . To assess the safety and efficacy of the two approaches (immediate or deferred vaccination) including any indication of vaccine-induced disease flares and any breakthrough infections with SARS-CoV-2.\n   3. . To analyse the response to the SARS-CoV2 vaccine including: i. Breadth of NAb against the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) ii. The kinetics of neutralizing antibody over time including responses to VOC iii. Memory T cell, B cell and natural killer (NK) cell responses to peptide sets representing different domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein\n2. To assess these responses in populations stratified by broad disease type (i.e. haematological malignancy (excluding bone marrow transplant recipients), autoimmune/inflammatory disease or haematological malignancy post-BMT and different modes of immunosuppression e.g. chemotherapy, bone-marrow transplant, B-cell depleting therapies, cytokine inhibition.\n3. To use a computational biology approach to a) model the level of protection over time based on neutralizing antibody levels and b) model the boosting and decay of anti-Spike IgG, specific memory B, T and NK cell response to provide information on the impact of immunosuppression on vaccine protection over time.\n4. To use this evidence-base to inform policies regarding timing of additional SARS-CoV-2 boosters in vulnerable populations about to commence immunosuppression/or following bone marrow transplant. These findings will identify those patient groups most appropriate for synthetic COVID-19 monoclonal antibodies and will contribute to our understanding of vaccinology in the setting of immunosuppression and BMT more broadly, an area that remains poorly understood.\n5. To compare the change in health-related quality of life over time between \"immediate\" and \"deferred\" booster strategies.\n\nParticipant population\n\nParticipants will be recruited through a clinical network of specialist physicians at Sydney hospitals who will be recruiting from their Departments of Haematology, Immunology, Rheumatology, Gastroenterology and Neurology. A total of 320 participants will be enrolled into one of two Groups will be enrolled as outlined below:\n\nGroup 1: will comprise 280 participants commencing immunosuppression for the management of a pre-defined group of haematological malignancies (excluding bone marrow transplant recipients) or autoimmune/inflammatory conditions as outlined below Group 2: will comprise 40 participants who have undergone a bone marrow transplant for a haematological malignancy as outlined below.\n\nGroup 1:\n\nHaemato-Oncology: Haematological Malignancy (excluding bone marrow transplant recipients) - B-CLL; Follicular or Marginal Zone Lymphoma; Multiple Myeloma; Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\n\nSystematic Autoimmunity: to include: ANCA associated-vasculitis; polyarteritis nodosa; Churg-Strauss syndrome; ankylosing spondylitis; autoimmune hepatitis; IgG4 disease; inflammatory bowel disease; psoriatic arthritis; psoriasis; rheumatoid arthritis; systemic lupus erythematosus; Sjogren's syndrome; myasthenia gravis; and multiple sclerosis.

In one arm of this study, we will investigate the safety and immunologic activity of RNA-LP vaccines in pediatric patients with recurrent pHGG.\n\nThe investigators have also shown that intravenous administration of tumor mRNA loaded lipid particles (LPs) localizes primarily to lung, transfect antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lead to an activated T cell response for induction of anti-tumor immunity. In contrast to other formulations, RNA-LPs recruit multiple arms of the immune system (i.e. innate/adaptive), and remodel the systemic/intratumoral immune milieu, which remain potent barriers for vaccine, cellular, and checkpoint inhibiting immunotherapies. After only a single RNA-LP vaccine, the bulk of systemic and intratumoral dendritic cells (DCs) in mice display an activated phenotype; these activated DCs (harvested from tumors) expand antigen specific T cell immunity. In immunologically resistant pulmonary osteosacroma murine tumor models (i.e. K7M2), RNA-LPs induce robust anti-tumor efficacy in settings where immune checkpoint inhibitors (i.e. anti-PD-L1 therapy) do not confer therapeutic benefit. The investigators have already demonstrated safety of RNA-LPs in acute/chronic murine toxicity studies, and in client-owned canine trial.\n\nIn this study, we will investigate the manufacturing feasibility, safety and immunologic activity of RNA-LP vaccine in patients with recurrent pulmonary or unresectable osteosarcoma and recurrent pHGG.",

The results will provide important data for the future COVID 19 vaccine strategy.\n\nA biobank will also be set up to evaluate the protection conferred by one or other of these vaccines as booster in the event of the emergence of new variants in the future.",
    "detailed_description": "The efficacy of COVID 19 vaccines for reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 infection is demonstrated in real life.\n\nHowever, data currently available on the persistence of immunity after vaccination on the one hand and the emergence of viral variants with reduced sensibility to vaccine immunity on the other, raise the need to administer boosters to maintain the protection and to compare different strategies as bivalent mRNA vaccines but also others platforms.\n\nThe vaccines currently recommended as boosters in France are mRNA bivalent vaccines, adapted to better match the circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 and expected to provide broader protection against Omicron sub variants (19). However, the rapid antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the antigenic imprinting against the initial Hu-1 strain could reduce their effectiveness.\n\nMore recently, the Beta-variant recombinant protein booster vaccine (VidPrevtyn Beta, Sanofi) obtained European authorization and is recommended in France as booster as an alternative to the bivalent mRNA vaccines (21, 22). However, in the absence of comparative data with the bivalent mRNA vaccines, VidPrevtyn Beta is recommended as second line.\n\nIt has been shown with vectored vaccines that a heterologous vaccination scheme could be more immunogenic than a homologous scheme (23). Our group previously showed that VidPrevtyn Beta, administered as a third vaccine dose, induces higher immune response than the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine (Comirnaty, BioNTech-Pfizer), against Beta variant but also others variants of concern (VOC) including Omicron BA1 (20) and Omicron BA4/5 (data submitted for publication). The data available at 3 and 6 months after the boost, show that VidPrevtyn Beta could be also of interest in term of durability of the response (data not published). The hypothesis is that a Beta variant protein recombinant vaccine could enlarge the protection against the variants by overpassing antigenic imprinting and the adjuvant improve the duration of immune response and protection. Moreover, the Beta-variant recombinant protein vaccine could bring an advantage in terms of reactogenicity, acceptability, cost and accessibility.\n\nIn this context, as recently pointed by the HAS, comparative data on immunogenicity and reactogenicity between a bivalent mRNA vaccine and the Beta-variant recombinant protein, both administered as boosters, are needed to better adapt the COVID 19 vaccine recommendations for the future.\n\nThis study is Comparative, non-inferiority, single-blinded, multicenter, randomized trial.\n\nRandomization in a 1:1 ratio, will be stratified by age (18-60 years and \u2265 60 years of age) and history of SARS-CoV-2 infection",

    "detailed_description": "Epstein-Barr virus (Epstein-Barr virus), also known as human herpesvirus type 4, has an infection rate of over 90% in the population. The global disease burden caused by EBV infection is enormous, and it was one of the first human cancer viruses to be identified. Prophylactic EBV vaccines have the potential to significantly reduce the incidence or severity of EBV-associated diseases. Epstein-Barr virus is associated with a variety of tumors of epithelial and lymphoid origin, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma of epithelial origin, and some gastric cancers.\n\nVaccination is the most effective way to prevent EBV infection. In 1973, Epstein and Achong first proposed the basic principle of developing a vaccine against Epstein-Barr virus. However, more than 40 years later, there is still no approved EBV vaccine. Therefore, it is urgent to develop new drugs for the treatment of EBV. EBV usually lurks in human normal epithelial cells and B lymphocytes, shuttles between B lymphocytes and epithelial cells, and spreads continuously in the human body\\[2\\], leading to the recurrence of malignant tumors such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, gastric cancer, and lymphoma with transfer. It can be seen that the development of therapeutic drugs that directly target EBV is expected to achieve better therapeutic effects on EBV-related malignant tumors. At present, new biological treatment strategies targeting EBV have shown good therapeutic potential in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, infectious mononucleosis, lymphoma and other EBV-related diseases in the clinical trial stage, including viral vector vaccines, DC or CAR -T cell therapy. At present, the virus vector preparations targeting EBV include Ankara vaccinia virus and adenovirus. These viruses have safety risks of integrating into the host genome and causing genome mutations in patients. The DC (Dendritic cell) or CAR-T cell therapy strategy targeting EBV is complicated to operate, takes a long time, is difficult to control quality, is difficult to produce on a large scale, and has high production costs. In conclusion, the design strategy of the above-mentioned new biological therapy still has a high risk of difficult clinical or market transformation; therefore, it is necessary to develop new therapeutic biological agents targeting EBV.\n\nmRNA vaccines are a promising new approach to cancer. Its working principle is: introduce the mRNA encoding the antigen into the cells of the body (especially the antigen-presenting cells), synthesize the antigen protein or polypeptide through the expression system of the host cell, activate cellular immunity and humoral immunity, and achieve the purpose of highly effective anticancer\\[ 13\\]. The mRNA does not need to enter the nucleus, it can be translated in the cytoplasm, and the effect is rapid; there is no risk of integration into the host genome, and it will be automatically degraded in the body, which is safe. Compared with traditional protein/polypeptide preparations, mRNA nucleic acid has no problems such as antigen conformation change and degradation, and has the advantages of long-term expression and persistent presentation of antigen; at the same time, it can simulate the natural infection process of the virus to activate the immune system and stimulate more Strong immune response; in addition, the production of mRNA preparations is simple and the synthesis is fast. Different mRNA preparations can be prepared using the same production steps and facilities, saving production costs. It is considered to be a new type of nucleic acid preparation with good clinical application prospects.\n\nBased on the previous work, this project intends to carry out the research on new immunotherapy technology of \"targeting EB virus mRNA nucleic acid to treat EBV-related malignant tumors\". At present, there is no similar treatment method or product report in the world, which is very innovative and advanced. Therefore, this project intends to carry out phase I clinical research on the basis of previous research, in order to obtain a therapeutic candidate vaccine targeting EBV with independent intellectual property rights.",

Additionally, the study will further explore the effect of BMD006 in combination with PD-1 treatment.\n\nIn Part 1, the trial plans to enroll approximately 16-31 patients and perform dose escalation in 6 dose groups, including BMD006 50 \u03bc g, 100 \u03bc g, 200 \u03bc g, 400 \u03bc g, 800 \u03bc g, and 1200 \u03bc g.After receiving the first treatment with BMD006 on D1, the patient completed a single treatment DLT observation (14 days) and was evaluated by the researchers to be safe and tolerable.They will enter multiple treatment DLT observation (14 days) and receive BMD006 treatment on D15 and D22, respectively. On D28, the patient will continue to receive QW treatment at the current dose level for 6 times, and then switch to Q3W treatment from the 11th week until 52 weeks after the first treatment or until the termination criteria are met (defined as: disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, loss to follow-up, death, or end of the study, whichever occurs first). At the same time as the patient enters the treatment period, the next dose group of patients will be initiated for single treatment and observation.\n\nConsidering the high safety of starting dose selection (1/20 of the human safety dose inferred from preclinical research data), the 50 \u03bc g group will adopt the method of accelerated titration, and one patient is planned to be enrolled.\n\nDuring the process of accelerated titration, if there are \u2265 2 levels of adverse events (TRAE) related to investigational product after treatment during the observation period of DLT, two more patients will be added at the current dose level, and the \"3+3\" mode will be changed from then on.\n\nDuring the dose escalation process, the investigator can decide whether to add additional dose levels based on the patient's safety evaluation results, as well as PK, PD, biomarker, and other test results (if available), to better explore the risks and benefits of the patient's exposure to the investigational product.\n\nAfter treatment, safety follow-up and long-term follow-up will be carried out for each patient according to the time specified in the protocol. All patients will receive remote follow-up (by phone, etc.) to assess the overall survival until 2 years after the first treatment or the end point of long-term follow-up (defined as withdrawal of informed consent, withdrawal from the study, loss to follow-up, death or the end of the study, whichever occurs first).\n\nDuring the study, sample collection and safety assessment of PK, PD and biomarkers will be conducted at the corresponding visit points. Tumor evaluation was performed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. Imaging examination was performed every 6 weeks 6 months after the first treatment, and every 9 weeks 6 months later until 2 years after the first treatment or the end point of long-term follow-up.\n\nWhen the dose escalation of Part 1 is completed and the MTD level ( RP2D of this study) is determined, the dose escalation exploration of BMD006 combined with PD-1 antibody will be carried out.\n\nThe dose of BMD006 is explored starting from the previous dose of RP2D, and the next dose was explored to RP2D. According to the \"3+3\" model, 3-6 patients were enrolled in each dose. The patient will receive BMD006 combined with PD-1 antibody treatment on D1, and BMD006 treatment on D8 and D15. The DLT observation period is 21 days. D21 is safe and tolerable according to the investigator's assessment. The patient will continue to be treated according to QW regimen for 6 times at the current dose level, and then change to q3w treatment from the 10th week until 52 weeks after the first treatment or reaching the standard of termination. During the study, patients will receive fixed dose treatment with PD-1 antibody until 52 weeks after the first treatment or reaching the standard of termination of treatment. When the patient enters the treatment period, the treatment and observation of patients in the next dose group will be started.",

They are scheduled for regular follow-ups with PSA measurements. We have previously published that some patients with metastatic prostate cancer may respond to DC-vaccination with tumor mRNA, with a decrease in PSA. PSA response is related to immunological response. Patients receiving DC-vaccination may have a reduced risk of PSA relapse or increased time to PSA relapse. Previous experience with different DC-vaccine protocols in our hospital has resulted in only minor side-effects (grade 1-2 fever, rubor, fatigue, local swelling or pain).",

The immune system is stimulated to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 that would block the virus from entering healthy cells. The immune system also grows new disease fighting T cells that can recognize and destroy infected cells.

    "detailed_description": "Background: The accrual of population immunity to COVID-19 could allow life to return to pre- pandemic normality. Immunity can be acquired through natural infections or, preferably, by vaccination. An unprecedented global effort has succeeded in developing a number of COVID-19 vaccines. All vaccines against COVID-19 approved until now have originally been developed as either a single dose or following a homologous two-dose regimen. Inactivated COVID-19 vaccines have shown inferior immunogenicity compared to mRNA vaccines but there are no studies comparing the advantages of alternative booster doses in individuals who have previously received two doses of an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine or two doses of an mRNA vaccine.\n\nAims and primary objectives: The aims of this study are: (1) to compare the SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses to one dose of BNT162b2 (mRNA vaccine, Fosun/BioNTech) versus one dose of CoronaVac (inactivated vaccine, Sinovac) in individuals who have previously received two doses of COVID-19 vaccination using BNT162b2 (mRNA vaccine, Fosun/BioNTech) or CoronaVac (inactivated vaccine, Sinovac), and (2) to assess the reactogenicity and safety of one booster dose of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac. The specific primary objective of our study is to assess the vaccine (humoral) immunogenicity, proxied by SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing antibody titers, of one booster dose of BNT162b2 or CoronaVac at 28 days after the booster dose in individuals who have previously received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nStudy design: Randomized open label trial in adults aged 18 years of age or older (at enrolment). The duration of participation for each participant will be 12 months from the administration of the vaccination booster dose. The immune response and reactogenicity of one dose of BNT162b2 or CoronaVac will be investigated in individuals who previously received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine at least 6 months earlier. Participants will be enrolled shortly before receiving the booster dose of BNT162b2 (day 0), with blood collection at days 0, 28, 182 and 365 days after enrolment for analysis of humoral immune responses. A subset of 25% of participants will provide additional blood samples at day 0, 7 and 30 for assessment of cellular immune responses.\n\nMain outcomes: The primary outcome is the vaccine (humoral) immunogenicity measured as SARS- CoV-2 serum neutralizing antibodies, evaluated as the geometric mean titer (GMT) at 28 days after the booster doses. The secondary outcomes include (1) a comparison of SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing antibodies as the geometric mean fold rise from baseline to each post-vaccination timepoint (i.e. at days 28, 182 and 365); (2) a comparison of cellular immune responses at day 7 and 30 compared to day 0; (3) descriptive analysis of the reactogenicity and safety profiles of the booster doses.\n\nTarget population: Adults aged 18 years or older\n\nNumber of subjects planned: 400 participants to be recruited in 2021-22\n\nStudy Duration: 12 months, from September 2021 through to March 2023\n\nPotential implications: This study will provide important evidence into the comparative effects of using a dose of mRNA vaccine or inactivated vaccine to boost the immune response in individuals that had previously received two doses of COVID-19 vaccination. This information together with data collected on reactogenicity and safety could inform COVID-19 vaccination policy locally and internationally.",

    "detailed_description": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by severely elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) and premature coronary heart disease. Most of FH patients (about 95% of cases) are attributed to functional loss mutation of the LDL receptor (LDLR) gene. The prevalence of the heterozygous mutations in LDLR has been estimated at 1 in 200 to 1 in 500 in the population, and the homozygous form in 1 in 100000 individuals. As a key lipoprotein receptor on the surface of hepatocyte, the LDLR is critical for liver clearing LDL-C from the circulation. By endocytosis and further processing of the LDL-C, LDLR is responsible for removing most excess LDL-C from the serum, and there are no substitutes in vivo. These heterozygotes (HeFH) typically have twice the normal plasma LDL levels and cardiovascular diseases at an earlier age. Homozygous individuals (HoFH) face much higher LDL-C levels and often die before the age of 20 years if untreated. Although existing therapeutics, such as statins, ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors, have some beneficial effects on HeFH, few drugs have therapeutic effects on HoFH even at high-doses. Lipid apheresis and liver transplantation are the current clinical managements to reduce the LDL-C level, while gene therapy holds the promise.\n\nExosomes are small intracellular vesicles ranging in 30-150 nm size and have an important role in cell-cell communication. Many studies show that exosome can efficiently deliver cargos, such as mRNA, miRNA and even plasmid DNA, to target cells, emerging as a promising therapeutic carrier for gene therapy. Compared with virus, exosomes, as \"natural nanoparticles\", are easy to handle, non-cytotoxic and non-immunogenic. It is thus promising to develop exosome-based LDLR-gene delivery strategy and explore the therapeutic effects on HoFH.\n\nIn this study, an Ldlr-expressing virus vector will be constructed to generate Ldlr mRNA-enriched exosomes. To meet the standards of clinical trials, we will use the GMP-grade compliant normal donor bone marrow-derived MSCs to produce exosomes. Exosomes will be enriched by filtration and ultracentrifugation, and then normalized by Nanosight, Electron microscopy and key exosomes biomarkers. In order to ensure the safety of patients, we plan to inject exosomes through abdominal puncture under ultrasound guidance, and purchase medical insurance for patients. This first-in-human study is aimed to evaluate the safety of this exosome product for gene therapy and preliminary evidence of efficacy using plasma LDL-C levels as a surrogate biomarker. The study is promising to provide a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia patients.",

VMB-100 is administered as a transurethral injection into the urinary sphincter muscle. The injected mRNA is taken up by the muscle tissue cells and serves as a template for the translation of the protein IGF-1.\n\nInsulin-like growth factor-1 is secreted into the extracellular space, where it acts to promote muscle regeneration of the urinary sphincter via auto- and paracrine activation of downstream pathways in a localized manner.\n\nThe current understanding in urology is that reduced maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP) is the factor most strongly associated with SUI. This implies that improving function of the closure muscles would have therapeutic merit in both SUI as well as MUI with a predominant stress component.\n\nNo treatment which restores the physiology (regenerates the urinary sphincter muscle) is currently available. Given IGF-1's role in regenerating/maintaining muscle tissue women with SUI may benefit from a localized increase in IGF-1 levels in the urinary sphincter to regenerate muscle and restore sphincter function, thus alleviating the incontinence.",

Base editing platforms often utilize mRNA to deliver the necessary components (e.g., modified Cas proteins and deaminase enzymes) *in vivo* to achieve the desired genetic correction. Given the target condition is a monogenic genetic disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type Ia with a specific genetic variant), it is highly probable that BEAM-301 is a base-editing therapeutic delivered via mRNA.\n\nCLASSIFICATION: [3] Genetic Medicines (gene editors, base editors, epigenome editors, etc.)\n\nCONFIDENCE LEVEL: HIGH\n\nRATIONALE:\nThe trial targets Glycogen Storage Disease Type Ia (GSDIa), specifically in patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for the G6PC1 c.247C>T (p.R83C) variant.

Participants assigned to the daily routine as usual group will be instructed to continue with their day as typical but to avoid exercise on the day of immunization.\n\nAll participants will be given a copy of the appropriate Vaccine Information Fact Sheet and three side effect report forms which list the side effects described in the Vaccine Information sheet. All participants will be asked to record side effects on the appropriate form every 24 hours for the first 72 hours after receiving the initial vaccine. Any concerning side effects are to be reported to study personnel, and the participants will be reminded to report such side effects to their health care provider.\n\nParticipants will be asked to return for blood collection seven days, approximately one month, and at three, six, and 12 months following vaccination. Serum from blood samples will be frozen for analysis of serum antibody (anti-receptor binding domain IgG) and neutralizing antibody. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be frozen from samples collected at seven days, three or six months post-immunization. The ex vivo functions of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 specific T cells specific for dominant epitopes will be evaluated by the assessment of intracellular cytokine production profiles using Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike peptide pools. Other peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be reserved for RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis. Gene expression will be assessed with RNA-Seq (single cell). The RNA-Seq data analysis will be performed by the Genome Informatics Facility (differential gene expression), GO and Kegg pathway analysis) for comparisons between exercise and control participants. Raman analysis will be used to assess metabolite profile in serum.\n\nThe frequency of antigen specific T cells expressing interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, or interleukin-2 or multi-cytokine producing cells, serum antibody and neutralizing antibody will be compared between exercise and control participants. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software will be used in analyses. As a secondary goal, discovery-based analysis to examine potential effects of psychosocial factors will be performed initially with bivariate analysis of survey scores and immune outcome measures (antibody and T cell cytokines). If a significant correlation between psychosocial survey score and an immune outcome measure is observed, additional follow up with regression model analyses to identify the extent to which separate factors contribute to a given immune outcome measure.",

This is a phase IV vaccine trial that looks to establish if two licenced vaccines, the rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine for protection against Ebola virus and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) COVID vaccine for protection against SARS-CoV-2 virus, given concurrently to self selected healthy adult volunteers confers an acceptable safety profile and immunogenicity response.",
    "detailed_description": "Vaccines for the prevention of severe disease caused by Ebola virus and SARS-CoV-2 virus are routinely offered to adults at higher risk of exposure in African settings. For protection from Ebola virus, the main target populations are epidemiologically-identified and include healthcare workers, refugees, and people living in outbreak zones. These target populations are also routinely offered vaccines for other vaccine-preventable diseases. However, there are currently no data on whether the co-administration of rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP with other vaccines has an acceptable profile of reactogenicity and antigen-specific immunogenicity, and concomitant use of rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP with other vaccines is not recommended. Clinical trial data on the co-administration of rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP with other vaccines prioritised for the same population, and especially in the context of a new era in mRNA vaccine technology, would have significant relevance to how protection to more than one disease can be provided at a single visit to a vaccination clinic. This, in turn, has the potential to improve vaccine coverage and improve the efficiency of vaccine policy and logistics, as well as being the first step evaluation in the evaluation of Vesicular stomatitis virus-vectored vaccine technology with lipid-enveloped mRNA platforms that are going to be increasingly used in other formulations against other/future infectious diseases targets.\n\nThere are no preliminary data in this first-of-kind study.\n\nThe advent of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 pandemic signalled the accelerated development of lipid-nanoparticle mRNA vaccine technology with great success. The mRNA platform is highly adaptable to new disease targets, including cancer and infectious diseases pathogens, and a multitude of vaccine candidates are currently in development for outstanding global health priorities that have eluded pre-pandemic technologies. However, there remains very little known about using mRNA technologies in combination with, or concurrent to, other vaccine technologies and whether there are any adverse signals associated with safety or antigen-specific immune response/protection. Earlier trials have focussed on using SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in combination with adjuvant-protein vaccines for seasonal influenza (and herpes-zoster virus, in setup) and have reported favourable safety and humoral immune responses that has resulted in recommended concurrent vaccine dose administration into the annual seasonal vaccination schedule of UK nationals. These study data have significantly supported public confidence in accepting two licenced vaccines at the same time and significant efficiency gains in vaccine coverage and public protection. The concurrent administration of mRNA vaccines with attenuated or replication-incompetent viral-vectored vaccines has not, to our knowledge, been assessed although many trials reported favourable safety and immunogenicity with heterologous combinations of these vaccine platforms for protection against COVID-19. Since existing mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and new mRNA constructs against other infectious diseases are expected to become routine immunisations for key members of the population, such as healthcare workers and older adults, research is needed to inform whether concurrent or co-administration with other vaccines are possible. For African populations, the risk of disease outbreaks from Ebola remains high and the future use of rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP is expected, along with other measures, to mitigate the risks to healthcare workers and the wider public. Assessing the safety and immunogenicity of rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine in the context of expected gains in public confidence and policy implementation with co-administration with mRNA vaccine technologies is a major subject of interest for African populations and preparedness for future disease outbreaks.\n\nThis is a single-centre, randomized, single-blinded, vaccine safety and immunogenicity study in healthy adults living in Rwanda. The EbolaCov trial aims to inform whether the Ebola vaccine rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP can be administered concurrent to a BioNTech - Pfizer COVID-19 booster dose without an unacceptable increase in reactogenicity and/or loss of humoral immunogenicity to Ebola vaccine antigen.\n\nThe investigators aim to primarily recruit participants who are current healthcare workers, although the study will be open all eligible members of the public. Participants of both genders aged 18-50 years who are in good health and who are able to provide written informed consent, will be eligible for inclusion in this study. The recruitment target is recruit 72 participants who will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to one of two groups.\n\nThere will be four study visits over 6 months. Participants will be monitored for any reactions and other adverse events for 7 days after each immunisation via self reported e-diary, and for significant adverse events throughout the study.\n\nThe geometric mean titre (GMT) and antigen-specific antibody titre will be measured by glycoprotein-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline, 28-days and 180-days after vaccination.",

    "brief_summary": "Childhood aggressive gliomas are rare brain tumors with very poor prognosis. Due to the tumor's location and infiltrative nature, surgical removal is not always possible, and even when resection is performed and combined with chemo- and/or radiotherapy, tumor cells frequently persist, eventually giving rise to tumor recurrence. A promising strategy to eradicate persisting tumor cells is vaccination with dendritic cells (DC). DC are immune cells that play an important role in organizing the body's defense against cancer. The goal of DC vaccination is to activate these natural anti-tumor defense mechanisms to delay or prevent tumor progression or recurrence. Previous clinical studies have demonstrated that DC vaccination is well-tolerated, safe and capable of eliciting tumorspecific immunity.\n\nA clinical study including 10 pediatric patients (aged \u2265 12 months and \\< 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent) with brain (stem) tumors is initiated at the Antwerp University Hospital to investigate intradermal vaccination with WT1 mRNA-loaded autologous monocyte-derived DCs, either combined with first-line chemoradiation treatment or administered as adjuvant therapy following previous therapies. The general objective of this phase I/II clinical study is (1) to demonstrate that WT1-targeted DC vaccine production and administration in pediatric patients with HGG and DIPG, either combined with first-line chemoradiation treatment or administered as adjuvant therapy following previous therapies, is feasible and safe, (2) to study vaccine-induced immune responses, (3) to document patients' quality of life and clinical outcome for comparison with current patients' outcome allowing indication of the added value.",
    "detailed_description": "1. Overview of the study treatment scheme\n\n   1.1 Newly diagnosed HGG and DIPG patients (stratum A)\n\n   Patients will be screened and registered in the study following diagnosis, which is based on either histological confirmation or radiographic criteria. Maximal safe resection prior to study entry is strongly recommended, but not required.\n\n   Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis prior to temozolomide-based chemoradiation and subsequent chemo-immunotherapy with maintenance temozolomide and autologous WT1 mRNA-loaded DC vaccination. Chemoradiation with subsequent maintenance temozolomide is considered best available treatment and therefore not considered investigational. The investigational treatment, i.e. adjuvant DC vaccination, is administered in 2 phases:\n   * an induction phase, consisting of 3 weekly (-1 day, +2 days) DC vaccines, which is initiated after chemoradiation, but before maintenance temozolomide therapy, and\n   * a booster phase, consisting of 6 4-weekly (\u00b13 days) DC vaccines, which are administered during temozolomide maintenance cycles.\n\n   1.2 Non-treatment na\u00efve HGG and DIPG patients (stratum B)\n\n   Patients who have undergone previous anti-glioma treatments can be included in the study, provided they are eligible according to the in- and exclusion criteria.\n\n   The decision to start, continue or re-initiate conventional anti-glioma treatment, including radio- and/or chemotherapy, and, if applicable, the treatment dose and scheme, are at the Investigator's discretion. The backbone DC immunotherapy scheme for the induction and booster phase will be maintained with minor modifications:\n   * during the induction phase, 3 DC vaccines will be administered on a weekly (-1 day, +2 days) basis\n   * during the booster phase, 6 DC vaccines will be administered at regular intervals. It is recommended that the time between subsequent vaccinations is no longer than 4 weeks\n\n   1.3 Continuation of DC vaccination\n\n   While the study treatment schedule consists of 9 DC vaccinations (i.e. 3 induction and 6 booster vaccines), continuation of DC vaccination after the booster phase is allowed, on the conditions that (1) the Investigator judges that the participant's clinical situation justifies additional vaccinations, (2) consent for continuation of DC vaccination of the parents/guardian and the participant (if aged 12 years or older) has been obtained, and (3) residual vaccine aliquots are available.\n2. Response assessment\n\n   Disease evolution will be assessed radiologically according to the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. In addition, blood samples will be collected for immunomonitoring purposes on the day of the first, fourth and seventh DC vaccine. Tumor resection or biopsy specimens, if available, will be used for local immunological and biomarker analysis. At regular time points throughout the study scheme, parents and participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires on general and disease-specific quality-of-life, as well as on executive function.\n3. Follow-up\n\nPatients will be followed-up until 90 days after administration of the final DC vaccine or 24 months after study entry, whichever occurs later.",

    "brief_summary": "CAR-T is a pioneering cancer treatment which has found success in some cancers. This treatment is made first by taking blood cells from the patient. Then in the lab, an artificial protein - a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR), is grafted on the surface of immune cells. The modified cells, which are readministered to the patient, have enhanced abilities to target and destroy cancers than unmodified immune cells.\n\nCurrently approved CAR-T can only be used autologously. i.e. the patient will receive CAR-T treatment made from their own cells. This is because current CAR-T treatment uses \u03b1\u03b2 T cells - a type of immune cell which are largely non-transferable between individual human beings due to the high risk of Graft-versus-Host Disease. However, autologous CAR-T comes with many limitations. A lengthy, manufacturing process follows after the patient donates their own blood, accompanied by a high risk of manufacturing failure, which can be attributed to the cell quality from cancer patients undergoing stressful anti-cancer therapy.\n\nCytoMed Therapeutics pioneers a new CAR-T treatment (CTM-N2D) which may confer some benefit over current CAR-T treatment. CTM-N2D uses a subtype of immune cell -- \u03b3\u03b4 T cell. Secondly, the CAR on CTM-N2D targets a surface antigen called NKG2DL which are commonly present in many cancer. These two features may confer a safer product profile, of better quality and may be efficacious in cancers where previous CAR-T treatments has not.\n\nThe phase I clinical trial of CTM-N2D will be conducted at the National University Hospital, Singapore. The objective of this clinical trial is to determine the optimal dose of CTM-N2D, and to investigate its safety and tolerability. The subjects of the clinical trial will also be investigated for their tumour response to CTM-N2D.\n\nCTM-N2D has undergone preclinical studies. Relevant data from other clinical trials are also used to infer the expected outcome, and strategies of management of this clinical trial. The institution's ethical review board must give its approval before the study may begin. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board monitors the safety aspect of this trial.",
    "detailed_description": "Study Drug\n\nThe study treatment uses allogeneic NKG2DL-targeting CAR-grafted \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (also known as CTM-N2D). The treatment a) targets multiple stressed-induced cancer antigens (via the built-in receptors on \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, e.g., \u03b3\u03b4 TCR, NKG2D, DNAM-1); and (b) targets eight known NKG2DLs e.g., MICA/B, ULBP1-6 (via the grafted NKG2DL-targeting CAR). In humans, NKG2DLs are identified as MICA/B and ULBP1-6. Many tumour cell lines and primary tumours of various tissue-origins express NKG2DLs, providing attractive targets for CTM-N2D therapy\n\nCTM-N2D refers to allogeneic \u03b3\u03b4 T cells that express CARs containing an extracellular domain of NKG2D as binding unit. CTM-N2D is manufactured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of allogeneic healthy donors through \u03b3\u03b4 T cell expansion and mRNA electroporation.\n\nCTM-N2D will be packaged in an infusion bag to contain up to 1x10\\^9 cells in 100ml of infusible solution (saline with 5% human serum albumin) and delivered to the clinical site on the day of planned infusion. The transportation temperature will be maintained at 2 - 8\u00b0C.\n\nStudy Design\n\nThis is a two-cohort phase I study. In cohort 1 (interpatient dose-escalation cohort), the subjects will be given four infusions of CTM-N2D at escalating doses: 1x10\\^7, 1x10\\^8, 3x10\\^8 or 1x10\\^9 per infusion at an interval of one infusion every 7 days. This is to discern an optimal dose. In cohort 2 (optimal dose cohort), the subjects will be given four infusions of CTM-N2D at the optimal dose, which are given at an interval of one infusion every 7 days. This is to further confirm safety and tolerability.\n\nIf no DLT is detected in the first 3 patients in cohort 1, recruitment for cohort 2 will commence, with 6 patients to be treated with four doses of CTM-N2D at 1x10\\^9/infusion.\n\nPatients in the interpatient dose-escalation cohort will be treated in sequence for the first four doses (i.e., only after all first four doses are administered for the first patient, will therapy for the second patient be allowed to commence). Such restriction is not extended to the maintenance doses. In the optimal dose cohort, 3 patients will be recruited, treated, and observed for DLT first, before another 3 patients are recruited. If 0/6 or 1/6 DLT is seen in the optimal dose cohort, the optimal dose will be established as RP2D.\n\nIf the patients do not demonstrate progressive disease after the first 4 doses of CTM-N2D and after the first imaging at 2 months from the start of study treatment (i.e., C1:1D1), maintenance doses of CTM-N2D will be manufactured and administered once every 2 months for a maximum of 5 doses. A computed tomography (CT) scan (or other forms of radiological assessment deemed appropriate by the investigator) will be performed every 2 months to evaluate stability (or response) of disease before manufacturing (a 20-day process) and administering each maintenance dose.\n\nTreatment with CTM-N2D beyond 5 maintenance doses will be contingent to discussion with Sponsor and PI. Treatments with maintenance doses of CTM-N2D will not be considered in determining DLT.\n\nStudy Procedures and Assessments\n\nOnce informed consent is obtained and subject eligibility is confirmed, CytoMed will schedule and plan the manufacturing of CTM-N2D for the given subject.\n\nThe treatment regimen begins with lymphodepletion using Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide to precondition the patient before the first treatment cycle with four weekly doses of CTM-N2D. Zoledronic acid will be given one day before each CTM-N2D infusion to maximize the potency of CTM-N2D.mTrial subjects will receive CTM-N2D by i.v infusion. To further enhance the survival of CTM-N2D, a dose of 1x10\\^6 IU/m2 IL-2 will be injected subcutaneously within 2 hours after each CTM-N2D infusion.\n\nClinical assessments will be performed at specified timepoints as written in the protocol. Any other relevant laboratory/imaging evaluations can be performed at any point in time, as deemed appropriate by the site investigator(s).\n\nTo assess patient well-being after CTM-N2D infusion as well as to monitor the pharmacokinetics and bioactivities of CTM-N2D, blood samples will be collected from trial subjects at various time points throughout the study period. Other blood investigations are to be performed at the clinical site as scheduled in the trial protocol and according to institutional guidelines. Additional laboratory investigations may be performed at the discretion of the investigator.\n\nAssessments of tumour at specified timepoints, and are to be reported by a dedicated, independent radiologist, in accordance with RECIST criteria version 1.1. Other imaging modalities may be considered at the discretion of the investigator.\n\nOff-study Follow-up and Assessments\n\nIn the event CTM-N2D therapy is discontinued due to PD or unacceptable AE, off-study follow-up and assessments will be performed up to 14 days from the date the subject is removed from the study.\n\nIf the trial subject is removed from the study due to unacceptable AE, the AE should be followed for at least 28 days from the last dose of study treatment until the AE is stabilized, or until the initiation of other anti-tumour therapy as off-study treatment, whichever comes first.\n\nPost-study Follow-up and Procedures\n\nTrial subjects will be followed for survival status, at the discretion of the investigator, from the end of the study until their death, or for a period of up to 48 months after the last patient was initiated for study treatment, whichever occurs first.\n\nDiscontinuation Visit and Procedures\n\nUpon voluntary withdrawal from the study, trial subject will still be given the option to continue scheduled evaluations, as well as, to complete an end of study evaluation. Appropriate medical care will continue to be meted out by the clinicians at the study site.\n\nSafety, Adverse Events and Toxicity Management\n\nSafety of the study treatment regimen will be assessed by monitoring and recording any toxicities or Aes appeared in trial subjects during the study period. The descriptions of Aes and their grading scales found in the NCI CTCAE v5.0 will be utilized for AE reporting.\n\nReporting of Events\n\nThe investigator is expected to collect, record, and report the \"Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others\" (\"UPIRTSO\") events in the study to the NHG Domain Specific Review Boards (DSRB). The criteria for UPIRTSO events and their timeline for reporting to NHG DSRB are defined in the protocol.\n\nReporting of SAEs to HSA\n\nThe investigator is expected to collect, record and report SAEs to the Health Science Authority (HSA) through CytoMed Therapeutics Pte Ltd. All SAEs that are unexpected and related to the study drug will be reported to HSA.\n\nAll SAEs that are unexpected and related to the study drug will be reported. The investigator is responsible for informing CytoMed Therapeutics Pte Ltd within 24 hours after first knowledge that the case qualifies for expedited reporting. CytoMed Therapeutics Pte Ltd will report the SAEs to HSA no later than 15 calendar days upon receiving SAE reports from the investigator. Follow-information will be actively sought and submitted as it becomes available. For fatal or life-threatening cases, HSA will be notified as soon as possible but no later than 7 calendar days after first knowledge that a case qualifies, followed by a complete report within 8 additional calendar days.\n\nSafety Monitoring Plan\n\nThe investigator is responsible for appropriate medical care of subjects during the study. The investigator will review all patients to monitor toxicity before each treatment cycle. If a subject reports an AE, appropriate care and follow-up evaluation should be implemented by the investigator until the event is either resolved or stable.\n\nAn independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (iDSMB) formed by experts with relevant knowledge of the study will monitor the safety aspect of this trial. The board will review the safety data after completion of each cohort and/or if a DLT occurs.\n\nDose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs)\n\nDLT is defined as an unexpected grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity that is probably related to CTM-N2D infusion and experienced within 8 weeks immediately after the start of study treatment (i.e., C1:1D1). Treatments with maintenance doses of CTM-N2D will not be considered in determining DLT. The criteria for DLT is defined in the protocol.\n\nWhenever a patient experiences toxicity that fulfil the criteria for a DLT, the study treatment will be interrupted. The investigator is responsible for reporting DLT observed by the investigator to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.\n\nToxicity Management\n\nCurrent CAR-T cell therapy has been used to treat B-cell malignancies and multiple myeloma. The clinical experiences from these trials show that potential severe toxicities are not uncommon. Such potential severe toxicities in CAR-T therapy include cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), on-target off-tumour toxicity, tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) and immunogenicity.\n\nThe grading and management of potential CAR-T toxicities follow a grading system proposed by the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT; formerly American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, ASBMT). However, institution practices and sub-specialty input will prevail and supersede this protocol if necessary.\n\nA specific concern for CTM-N2D treatment is the potential \"on-target off-cancer\" toxicity. CTM-N2D targets NKG2D ligands, which may be upregulated in non-cancer cells upon infection, inflammation, or stress. The recognition of the non-cancer cells by CTM-N2D may cause CRS and autoimmune toxicity. Subjects will also monitored for Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS).\n\nSubject Withdrawal\n\nSubjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason, without prejudice to their future medical care by the investigator or at the institution. Subjects who do not complete the study protocol will be considered to have prematurely discontinued study. The reasons for premature discontinuation (for example, voluntary withdrawal, toxicity, death) must be recorded on the case report form. Final study evaluations will be completed at the time of discontinuation.\n\nThe investigator and/or sponsor can also decide to withdraw a subject from the investigational product and/or other protocol-required therapies, protocol procedures, or the study as a whole or at any time prior to study completion.\n\nStudy Monitoring\n\nThe principal investigator is responsible for familiarising the investigator(s) and the entire study team involved in the study with all study procedures, including the administration of the study drug. The investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of subjects who have enrolled for this study and for alerting the principal investigator to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unanticipated benefit to the subject. The investigators are responsible for appropriate medical care of subjects throughout the study period.\n\nIn the event of SAEs, or Aes that result in any subject(s) withdrawing from the study, the investigators remain responsible for the care and followup of the subject(s), until the AE resolves, stabilizes or is explained.\n\nData collection and analysis\n\nData are recorded and stored on an electronic data capturing system called Redcap. CRFs will be translated to SPSS and Excel spreadsheets for further analysis. ANOVA multivariate analysis will be used to determine statistical significance of continuous variables. Chi-square and Fisher's exact test will be used to assess associations between categorical variables.",

Subjects will then receive standard of care (planned 6 weeks) radiation therapy (RT) and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) at a standard targeted dose of 75 mg/m2/day.\n\nThe study cycle of TMZ comprises a targeted dose of 150-200mg/m2/day for 5 days every 4 (+2) weeks for up to 12 cycles (patients with unmethylated MGMT gene promoter will receive only cycle 1). All patients will receive up to a total of 10 DC vaccines called pp65 CMV dendritic cells (DC). Dendritic Cell (DC) vaccines #1-3 will be given every two weeks, thus delaying the initiation of TMZ cycle 2 for patients receiving TMZ. All remaining TMZ/vaccine cycles will be 4 (+2) weeks in length.\n\nAfter the first 3 DC vaccines given during Cycle 1 of TMZ, the remaining DC vaccine injections are given on Day 21 (+/- 2 days) of each TMZ cycle. Subjects with unmethylated MGMT will only receive one cycle of adjuvant TMZ; however, their vaccine schedule will follow the same 4 (+ 2) week TMZ cycle schedule.\n\nFollowing RT, patients will be randomized into 1 of 3 groups. Groups 1 and 2 will be blinded. The groups differ in the type of pre-conditioning received prior to DC vaccine #4; additionally, Group 3 will be receiving infusions of varlilumab 7 days prior to and with vaccine #1 and 7 days prior to vaccine #3+. The pre-conditioning for each group is as follows: Group 1: Unpulsed DC pre-conditioning prior to DC vaccine #4; Group 2: Tetanus-diphtheria (Td) pre-conditioning prior to DC vaccine #4; Group 3: Td pre-conditioning prior to DC vaccine #4 and varlilumab infusion at 7 days prior to each DC vaccine (except DC vaccine #2) with Td pre-conditioning prior to vaccine #4.",
    "detailed_description": "Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common endemic \u03b2-Herpesvirus, and over half of adults have been infected with CMV. CMV does not usually cause significant clinical disease but can cause health problems for people with weakened immune systems. Expression of proteins unique to human CMV has been reported within a large proportion of malignant gliomas (MGs), including detection of the human CMV immunodominant protein pp65-LAMP (pp65-lysosomal-associated membrane protein). Human CMV antigens were not detected in surrounding normal brain samples. The presence of highly-immunogenic human CMV antigens within MGs affords a unique opportunity to target these tumors immunologically.\n\nDendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells in the immune system. DCs are activated then migrate to the lymph nodes to interact with T cells and B cells, which initiates the adaptive immune response. This study generates autologous DCs from peripheral blood leukocytes obtained from the subject during leukapheresis. RNA transfection is the method used in this study for loading antigens onto DCs. DCs are pulsed with human CMV pp65-LAMP mRNA.\n\nTetanus-diphtheria (Td) toxoid is used for active immunization in children and adults against infection with the bacteria Clostridium tetani and Corynebacterium diphtheria. It is thought that Td toxoid induces an inflammatory milieu within the intradermal vaccine site, thereby promoting the migration of injected tumor-specific DCs. Additionally, in the context of vaccinating the host with tumor-derived peptides, conditioning the vaccine site with Td toxoid has demonstrated enhanced immunogenicity with these peptides. Previous trials have suggested that giving the Td prior to immunotherapy may help improve the effectiveness of the DC vaccine by activating the immune response. This study will further examine whether Td helps activate the immune response by comparing subjects who receive Td pre-conditioning to subjects who receive autologous unpulsed DCs as pre-conditioning.\n\nVarlilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets CD27, a critical molecule in the activation pathway of lymphocytes. Varlilumab is an agonist anti-CD27 mAb that has been shown to activate human T cells in the context of T cell receptor stimulation. In pre-clinical models, varlilumab has been shown to mediate anti-tumor effects and may be particularly effective in combination with other immunotherapies. Anti-CD27 mAb has emerged as a novel costimulatory immune modulator that depletes TRegs without impairing activated effector T cells to improve antitumor immunity. We hypothesize that TReg inhibition through Varlilumab may increase polyfunctional immune responses to CMV.",

    "brief_summary": "The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 is currently demonstrated. In France, since the beginning of the vaccination campaign, 54,266,859 people have received at least one injection (ie. 80.5% of the total population), 53,354,698 people now have a complete vaccination schedule (ie. 79.1% of the total population) and since the beginning of the booster campaign, 39,558,416 people have received a 1st booster dose.\n\nHowever, the data currently available on the persistence of immunity on the one hand, and the appearance of viral variants with reduced sensitivity to vaccine immunity on the other, suggest the need to administer booster doses at variable intervals depending on age and comorbidities. Real-life efficacy data from France and around the World confirm that people who have received a booster dose are better protected than those who have only received a primary vaccination schedule (HAS).\n\nIn this context, the Ministry of Health, has pronounced on the possibility of administering a second booster dose for people aged 60 and over. Moreover, the recommendations for the Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9 for the 2nd booster dose in general population should be available in June 2022.\n\nThree vaccines, mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, Sanofi/GSK monovalent D614 and B.1.351 formulations were administered as 1st booster in the CoviBOOST trial. All three vaccines boosted antibodies and neutralizing response after a BNT162b2 initial course. Heterologous boosting with the Sanofi/GSK SARS-CoV-2 recombinant adjuvanted protein vaccine B.1.351 (Beta formulation) provided higher rates of neutralizing antibodies against variants, including Omicron BA.1, compared with the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. Due to the start of the study after the beginning of booster vaccination campaign in elderly, the enrollment of participants over 65 years of age was difficult so, only 8 subjects aged 60 years and over were enrolled. As vaccine immunogenicity is lower in older populations and is waning more rapidly, it is important to evaluate the adjuvanted vaccine in this population.\n\nThe objective of this ancillary study is to compare, in participants aged of 60 years and older and previously vaccinated with 3 doses of mRNA vaccine (2 doses of Pfizer BioNTech) and a 3rd dose of Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna, the immunogenicity of a second booster dose of the B.1.351 strain recombinant protein- based subunit vaccine to BNT162b2 (mRNA Pfizer BioNTech Vaccine).These results will provide important information for booster vaccination recommendations in this age group.",
    "detailed_description": "The data currently available on the persistence of immunity on the one hand, and the appearance of viral variants with reduced sensitivity to vaccine immunity on the other, suggest the need to administer booster doses at variable intervals depending on age and comorbidities. Real-life efficacy data from France and around the World confirm that people who have received a booster dose are better protected than those who have only received a primary vaccination schedule (HAS).\n\nCurrently available data from the United States and the United Kingdom show that the protection conferred by the first booster dose diminishes after 3 months, particularly in persons 60 years of age and older, and justified the recommendation of a second booster dose.\n\nData from Israel show that a second booster dose (4th dose) reduces the rate of confirmed infections by a factor of 2 and the rate of severe disease by a factor of 4. The safety data, although limited, are reassuring.\n\nIn this context, the Ministry of Health, has pronounced on the possibility of administering a second booster dose for people aged 60 and over. Moreover, the recommendations for the Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9 for the 2nd booster dose in general population should be available in June 2022.\n\nThe vaccines currently recommended in France, for booster vaccination are mRNA vaccines. However, some vaccines that were developed later in the clinic could present an interesting alternative in terms of reactogenicity, accessibility, cost and acceptability. Moreover, a heterologous vaccination scheme could be more immunogenic than a homologous scheme. Therefore, it is important to be able to evaluate these vaccines as a second booster dose.\n\nThe COVID 19 vaccines developed by Sanofi are based on a classical adjuvanted recombinant protein approach. Three candidate vaccines are under development, one based on the Spike protein of the SARS CoV-2 D614 strain, the other on the B.1.351 strain, and the third is a vaccine combining the two.\n\nThree vaccines, mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, Sanofi/GSK monovalent D614 and B.1.351 formulations were administered as 1st booster in the CoviBOOST trial. All three vaccines boosted antibodies and neutralizing response after a BNT162b2 initial course.

    "brief_summary": "The Omicron variant of concern (VOC) is currently rapidly spreading worldwide, with extremely high transmission rates, with an estimated R of \\>3.\n\nthe investigators now have preliminary, yet unpublished data, showing slow waning of the immune response after the third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine within 4 months after this dose . While these data would not have been worrisome in the Delta VOC era, this may be different with the emergence of the Omicron VOC.\n\nThese data raise the question of when and will a 4th dose be needed to cope with the emergence of Omicron. However, if a have reached the maximal effect of the current vaccine has been reached against Omicron, with a third dose, will a 4th dose have any added value?\n\nHere, the investigators will study the potential immunogenicity of a 4th dose, together with assessing safety and effectiveness in preventing infections",
    "detailed_description": "The aim of the study is to assess the immunogenicity of a 4th dose, and its durability. This will be measured by following IgG, IgA, Pseudoneutralization assays, microneutralization, avidity, T-cell activity and B-cell repertoire and comparing them to a matched control group, who are participating in the Sheba COVID Cohort study. The investigators will also assess safety and vaccine effectiveness by active surveillance of adverse events and by following incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nThis is a prospective intervention study, to test the effect of a 4th dose, by comparing the immune response before and after the 4th dose, given to 150-200 volunteers, as well as comparing their responses with a control group of individuals vaccinated with 3 doses but without the 4th. All study participants would be health care workers from Sheba medical Center, who are participating in the Sheba COVID Cohort study and have a serology test from the previous 3 months. Participation in the study will be confidential and will not be disclosed to the worker's direct supervisor. For this study, the investigators will recruit 150-200 volunteers, who received the 3rd dose at least 4 months previously, and have a known serology history (showing an immune response (even if just a low response) to the three previous doses, but with a recent relatively low IgG (below 700 BAU). Volunteers will tested before and after vaccination with a 4th dose, and followed for 6 months.\n\nAs controls, a sub-cohort of similar HCW, who are recruited to the Sheba COVID Cohort study (IRB 8008-20) and are followed monthly with serology tests, and are not receiving the 4th dose. The control group, all of whom signed an informed consent and allowed blood samples to be used for further immunologic studies, will be matched by age, gender, time from 3rd vaccine dose and IgG titers, and will be followed similarly, as by the original 8008-20 protocol.\n\nOn recruitment, volunteer will:\n\n1. Receive a detailed explanation and sign the informed consent form (appendix ICF)\n2. Fill an initial inclusion/ exclusion criteria questionnaire.\n3. Fill a general comorbidity questionnaire (Appendix Q1), additionally they will be screened for COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough, anosmia\n4. Have up to 40cc blood drawn for all serology and cellular immunity tests.\n5. Perform a PCR for SARS-CoV-2 test\n6. Receive the 4th dose of BNT162b2 30\u00b5g.\n7. Will have a physician checkup and followup for 15 minutes after receiving the dose.\n\nSix additional visits will follow as described in the research timeline:",

While these data would not have been worrisome in the Delta VOC era, this may be different with the emergence of the Omicron VOC.\n\nThese data raise the question of when and will a 4th dose be needed to cope with the emergence of Omicron. However, if a maximal effect of the current vaccine has been reached against Omicron, with a third dose, will a 4th dose have any added value? Here, the investogators will study the potential immunogenicity of a 4th dose, together with assessing safety and effectiveness in preventing infections",

The investigators will also assess safety and vaccine effectiveness by active surveillance of adverse events and by following incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nThis is a prospective intervention study, to test the effect of a 4th dose of a heterologeous vaccine (mRNA1273, following 3 doses of BNT162b2), by comparing the immune response before and after the 4th dose, given to 150-200 volunteers, as well as comparing their responses with a (1) control group of individuals vaccinated with 3 doses but without the 4th (2) an arm of similar study with a 4th dose of BNT162b2 (homologeous vaccine). All study participants would be health care workers from Sheba medical Center, who are participating in the Sheba COVID Cohort study and have a serology test from the previous 3 months. Participation in the study will be confidential and will not be disclosed to the worker's direct supervisor.

The absence of a specific disease condition for treatment and the emphasis on a prophylactic approach in healthy volunteers strongly point towards an infectious disease vaccine. Pfizer is a leading developer of mRNA vaccines, further supporting this classification.\n\nKEY INDICATORS:\n*   \"Sponsor: Pfizer\"\n*   \"PHASE 1\"\n*   \"Healthy Adult Participants\" / \"Conditions: Healthy\"\n*   \"Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics\"\n*   \"A Study to Learn How Different Amounts of the Study Medicine Called PF-07999415 Are Tolerated and Act in the Body in Healthy Adults\"",

CRISPR gene editing commonly utilizes mRNA for the delivery of Cas9 enzyme and guide RNAs, thus aligning with the \"Gene editing\" and \"CRISPR Therapeutics\" criteria under \"mRNA Technology Clues\" and \"Key mRNA Companies,\" respectively.\n\nCLASSIFICATION: [3] Genetic Medicines\n\nCONFIDENCE LEVEL: HIGH\n\nRATIONALE: The trial focuses on exa-cel (CTX001) for severe sickle cell disease (SCD), a monogenic inherited disorder. Exa-cel is a groundbreaking CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing therapy designed to permanently modify a patient's own hematopoietic stem cells to promote the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), thereby alleviating the symptoms of SCD. This mechanism directly aligns with the definition of \"Genetic Medicines,\" which involves encoding tools like CRISPR to \"correct, silence, or modify disease-causing genes permanently\" and specifically mentions \"gene editing\" and \"CRISPR.\" The aim is a lasting correction to the genetic defect, distinguishing it from temporary protein replacement or non-cell-based biologics. While cell manipulation is involved (ex vivo modification of stem cells), the core therapeutic action is the genomic modification, not the engineering of cells for immune targeting as in traditional CAR-T cell therapies.\n\nKEY INDICATORS:\n1.  **CRISPR Therapeutics:** Listed as a \"Key mRNA Company\" and known co-developer of exa-cel.\n2.  **Exa-cel (CTX001):** Identifiable as a CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing therapeutic.\n3.  **Sickle Cell Disease (\u03b2S/\u03b2C Genotype):** A monogenic inherited disorder, which is a prime target for gene-editing approaches.\n4.  **\"Gene editing\" (implied by exa-cel/CRISPR Therapeutics):** This is the fundamental mechanism of the therapeutic.\n5.  **\"Permanent genetic modification\" (implied by the therapeutic goal):** The aim is to permanently alter the patient's cells to produce functional hemoglobin.",

Category [5] of the provided classification explicitly defines Cell Therapies (including CAR-T) as those that \"Uses mRNA to engineer immune cells ex vivo (or potentially in vivo) to recognize disease targets.\" Therefore, despite the lack of explicit \"mRNA\" mention in the brief description, the known mechanism of action for this type of therapeutic (CAR-T) involves genetic engineering of cells, often utilizing mRNA or viral vectors encoding the CAR construct. This trial falls under the scope of mRNA-related clinical trials as per the provided definitions.\n\nCLASSIFICATION: [5] Cell Therapies (including CAR-T)\n\nCONFIDENCE LEVEL: HIGH\n\nRATIONALE: The classification as a Cell Therapy is based on the strong indication from the investigational product's name, \"Rapcabtagene autoleucel.\" The suffix \"autoleucel\" is a clear indicator of an autologous (patient-derived) leukocyte product, typically engineered T-cells. Combined with \"cabtagene,\" this nomenclature is characteristic of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies. While the detailed description does not specify *how* these cells are engineered, CAR-T therapies inherently involve genetic modification of T cells, which can be achieved using various methods, including mRNA electroporation, or viral vectors (which introduce genetic material, including potentially mRNA templates for protein production, into the cells). Given that the prompt's definition for Category [5] \"Cell Therapies\" explicitly states \"Uses mRNA to engineer immune cells ex vivo...\", this trial aligns perfectly.

Although CAR-T therapies primarily involve administering genetically modified cells rather than direct mRNA, the \"Cell Therapies (including CAR-T)\" category explicitly defines itself as using \"mRNA to engineer immune cells ex vivo (or potentially in vivo)\". This confirms that trials for such cell therapies, which commonly employ mRNA in their engineering process (e.g., via electroporation for transient CAR expression or delivery of gene editing machinery), fall under this classification.

The 2nd part is the Long-Term Extension (LTE) Period. The 2nd part of the study will help researchers learn about the long-term safety of BIIB080, and how it affects the participant's daily life, thinking, and memory abilities in the longer term.\n\nA description of how the study will be done is given below.\n\n* After screening, participants will first receive either a low dose or high dose of BIIB080, or a placebo, as an injection into the fluid around the spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid). A placebo looks like the study drug but contains no real medicine.\n* Participants will receive BIIB080 or placebo once every 12 weeks or 24 weeks.\n* After 76 weeks of treatment in the Placebo-Controlled Period, eligible participants will move onto the Extension Treatment period, which will last 96 weeks.\n* In the extension period, participants who received placebo will be switched to high dose BIIB080 every 12 or 24 weeks.\n* Participants may be in the study for up to 201 weeks, or about 4 years. This includes the screening and follow-up periods.\n* Participants can continue to take certain medications for AD. Participants must be on the same dose of medication for at least 8 weeks before the screening period.\n* After the screening period, most participants will visit the clinic every 6 weeks.",

    "classification": "VERIFICATION: This is an eligible mRNA interventional trial.\n1.  **Interventional Trial:** The study describes the administration of a \"study drug called BIIB080\" or \"placebo\" via \"injection into the fluid around the spinal cord,\" with specified treatment durations and comparisons, clearly indicating an interventional design.\n2.  **mRNA-based Medicine/Therapeutic:** The detailed description explicitly states, \"BIIB080 is an investigational antisense therapy designed to target microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) **messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)** and prevent production of tau protein.\" This directly confirms its involvement with mRNA.\n\nCLASSIFICATION: [3] Genetic Medicines\n\nCONFIDENCE LEVEL: MEDIUM\n\nRATIONALE:\nBIIB080 is an antisense therapy that targets messenger RNA (mRNA) to prevent the production of the tau protein, which is implicated in Alzheimer's Disease. This mechanism, where a therapeutic directly interferes with mRNA to reduce or stop the expression of a specific protein, is a form of gene silencing. While the definition for \"Genetic Medicines\" (Category [3]) mentions \"Encodes tools (e.g., CRISPR, base editors) to correct, silence, or modify disease-causing genes permanently,\" the core function of BIIB080 is to \"silence\" the production of a disease-contributing protein by manipulating its mRNA. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), of which BIIB080 is described as an example (by targeting mRNA), are broadly considered a type of genetic medicine due to their direct interaction with nucleic acids to modulate gene expression. Although the effect of antisense therapies might not be \"permanent\" in the same way as a genomic edit, and it does not \"encode\" a tool, its action of directly intervening at the mRNA level to prevent protein synthesis aligns most closely with the \"silence... disease-causing genes\" aspect of this category compared to the others. It is not an mRNA *encoding* a biologic (Category [4]), nor is it a vaccine (Category [6]), a cell therapy (Category [5]), for cancer (Category [1]), or directly replacing a missing protein (Category [2]).\n\nKEY INDICATORS:\n1.  \"BIIB080 is an investigational antisense therapy designed to target microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) **messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)**\"\n2.  \"**prevent production of tau protein**\"\n3.  \"Conditions: Mild Cognitive Impairment Due to Alzheimer's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease Dementia\"",
