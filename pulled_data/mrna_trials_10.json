    "detailed_description": "A novel zoonotic coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) mid-December 2019 and was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus rapidly spread to the rest of the world, including Europe and explicitly affects the respiratory system, generating Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\nUZ Brussel employees presenting symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 are offered to be tested with real-time PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. As asymptomatic infections have been described and as the PCR can be negative when taken late after onset of symptoms, serologic tests can be performed. The SARS-CoV 2003 epidemic demonstrated that serological assays were a useful diagnostic tool of non-acute infections. Although it is still uncertain whether convalescing patients have a risk of re-infection, recent data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could protect at least for some time from subsequent viral exposures.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic had devastating medical, economic and social consequences, safe and effective prophylactic vaccines were urgently needed. And thus several candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been developed. During the first weeks of the vaccination campaign, the health care workers of the UZ Brussel, were invited to receive the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine.\n\nConsequently, the investigators aim to prospectively document the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and seroconversion among vaccinated employees of the UZ Brussel, at three different time points, namely 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks; T1), 6 months (+/- 1 month; T2) and 12 months (+/- 1 month; T3) after the second vaccination.",

    "detailed_description": "Aging in female reproductive cells, particularly cumulus granulosa cells, is associated with various dysfunctions that compromise fertility. Melatonin, a hormone primarily produced by the pineal gland, is renowned for its multifaceted roles in regulating physiological processes, including sleep-wake cycles, immune function, and antioxidative defense. Melatonin's antioxidant action is mediated through direct scavenging of free radicals, upregulation of antioxidant enzymes, and improvement of mitochondrial efficiency. These properties make melatonin a promising candidate for mitigating the adverse effects of aging on cellular function. This study aims to explore the effects of melatonin supplementation on cumulus cell gene expression and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes in women over 35 years old. In the study group, patients will receive melatonin supplementation for at least two months prior to their IVF cycles. In the control group, patients will proceed directly to IVF cycles without melatonin supplementation. Cumulus cells will be collected after oocyte retrieval, and gene expression will be measured. Additionally, clinical pregnancy rate, live birth rate, and miscarriage rate between the two groups will be evaluated.",

    "brief_summary": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 10% of all women and usually presents with irregular menstrual periods and difficulties conceiving. It is also a lifelong metabolic disorder and affected women have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Increased blood levels of male hormones, also termed androgens, are found in most PCOS patients. Androgen excess appears to impair the ability of the body to respond to the sugar-regulating hormone insulin (also termed 'insulin resistance'). Androgens circulating in the blood in women with PCOS are comprised of classic androgens (for example testosterone), and the less-characterised 11-oxygenated androgen subclass that arises from the adrenal glands. The investigators have recently demonstrated that 11-oxygenated androgens make up the majority of circulating androgens in women with PCOS.\n\nIn preliminary studies using minimally invasive adipose tissue sampling, the investigators have found that the fat tissue of women with PCOS overproduces classic androgens. This can lead directly to disturbances in the ability of fat cells to store fat effectively (lipotoxicity), resulting in insulin resistance and the consequent risk of liver damage. However, there are no published studies on in vivo androgen concentrations in the adipose tissue of women with PCOS. Furthermore, the scientific community do not have any information on whether adipose concentrations of 11-oxygenated androgens are also increased in women with PCOS.\n\nResearch Questions The investigators aim to examine the metabolism of classic and 11-oxygenated androgens in detail in both circulations and in the adipose tissue of women with PCOS. The investigators will examine how precursor variants of both 11-oxygenated and classic androgens, which are converted by the body into active hormones, are broken down (metabolised) within the adipose tissue of women with PCOS. The investigators will also investigate if the 11-oxygenated androgens have a differential impact on metabolic function as compared to classic androgens. This will give important insights into the adipose tissue metabolome in women with PCOS, and how locally generated androgens impact on adipose tissue function and metabolic risk.",
    "detailed_description": "In part A of the study, women with PCOS and obesity, identified from the previously established DAISy-PCOS cohort, and age- and BMI-matched healthy volunteers identified by advertisements, will be invited for a screening visit (Visit 1) at the National Institute of Health Research-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham. Once eligibility (described in detail in Section 7.1) has been confirmed, a written informed consent will be obtained, and the volunteers will be invited to three further metabolic assessment visits after an overnight fast.\n\nWhile Visits 2 and 3 (Study days 1 and 2, respectively) will be for the assessment of responses to an androgen-precursor challenge, Visit 4 (Study day 3) will run in the same format as the previous two Study days except no androgen will be administered. During each visit, study participants will undergo abdominal adipose tissue vein cannulation, whereby a catheter will be inserted (under ultrasound guidance and with local anaesthetic) into one of the veins of the abdominal fat tissue. Ultrasound Doppler and ethanol dilution by microdialysis will be employed to assess adipose tissue blood flow. A further catheter will be inserted into a vein on the back of the hand which will be placed a hot air box in order to obtain arterialised blood. Finally, a catheter will be inserted into an antecubital vein for the purposes of stable isotope infusion. Blood samples from the hand vein and from the abdominal adipose tissue vein will be taken in tandem every 30 minutes for measurement of various metabolites, androgens, and non-targeted metabolome studies. Salivary samples will be collected every 30 minutes in the first hour and hourly thereafter until the end of the study. Urine will be collected throughout the Study Visit. At time point 240 min, a standardised high-fat meal containing palmitate labelled with a stable isotope will be given to the participant, and measurements will continue, to assess how their metabolism responds to the meal. Furthermore, fat tissue biopsies will be taken from the subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue at the end of each study day. These fat biopsies will undergo RNA extraction for transcriptional profiling by RNA-sequencing and will be used for tissue incubation to determine their androgen-generating and metabolic capacity.\n\nOn Visits 2 and 3, participants will be administered either the classic androgen pathway precursor dehydroepiandrosterone or the 11-oxygenated androgen pathway precursor 11-ketoandrostenedione at time point 0 min. No androgen precursors will be administered during Visit 4. Otherwise, Visits 2-4 will be identical in their flow.\n\nIn part B of the study, paired subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue samples (up to 5 g), as well as a blood sample, are collected from female volunteers undergoing elective abdominal surgery. These tissue samples alongside the subcutaneous tissue obtained from the in vivo study (part A) will be used for ex vivo incubations with androgen precursors to study androgen activation and its metabolic impact. Additionally, the effect of Aldo-Keto Reductase Family 1 Member C3 inhibition on androgen activation will be assessed in ex vivo incubations. After the incubation, the culture medium and/or the tissue will be used for metabolome analysis (non-targeted global metabolome and steroid metabolome profiling) and transcriptome analysis. The blood sample will be used for serum multi-steroid profiling.",
