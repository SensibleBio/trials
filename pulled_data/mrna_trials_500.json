    "detailed_description": "A novel zoonotic coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) mid-December 2019 and was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus rapidly spread to the rest of the world, including Europe and explicitly affects the respiratory system, generating Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\nUZ Brussel employees presenting symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 are offered to be tested with real-time PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. As asymptomatic infections have been described and as the PCR can be negative when taken late after onset of symptoms, serologic tests can be performed. The SARS-CoV 2003 epidemic demonstrated that serological assays were a useful diagnostic tool of non-acute infections. Although it is still uncertain whether convalescing patients have a risk of re-infection, recent data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could protect at least for some time from subsequent viral exposures.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic had devastating medical, economic and social consequences, safe and effective prophylactic vaccines were urgently needed. And thus several candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been developed. During the first weeks of the vaccination campaign, the health care workers of the UZ Brussel, were invited to receive the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine.\n\nConsequently, the investigators aim to prospectively document the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and seroconversion among vaccinated employees of the UZ Brussel, at three different time points, namely 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks; T1), 6 months (+/- 1 month; T2) and 12 months (+/- 1 month; T3) after the second vaccination.",

    "detailed_description": "Aging in female reproductive cells, particularly cumulus granulosa cells, is associated with various dysfunctions that compromise fertility. Melatonin, a hormone primarily produced by the pineal gland, is renowned for its multifaceted roles in regulating physiological processes, including sleep-wake cycles, immune function, and antioxidative defense. Melatonin's antioxidant action is mediated through direct scavenging of free radicals, upregulation of antioxidant enzymes, and improvement of mitochondrial efficiency. These properties make melatonin a promising candidate for mitigating the adverse effects of aging on cellular function. This study aims to explore the effects of melatonin supplementation on cumulus cell gene expression and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes in women over 35 years old. In the study group, patients will receive melatonin supplementation for at least two months prior to their IVF cycles. In the control group, patients will proceed directly to IVF cycles without melatonin supplementation. Cumulus cells will be collected after oocyte retrieval, and gene expression will be measured. Additionally, clinical pregnancy rate, live birth rate, and miscarriage rate between the two groups will be evaluated.",

    "brief_summary": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 10% of all women and usually presents with irregular menstrual periods and difficulties conceiving. It is also a lifelong metabolic disorder and affected women have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Increased blood levels of male hormones, also termed androgens, are found in most PCOS patients. Androgen excess appears to impair the ability of the body to respond to the sugar-regulating hormone insulin (also termed 'insulin resistance'). Androgens circulating in the blood in women with PCOS are comprised of classic androgens (for example testosterone), and the less-characterised 11-oxygenated androgen subclass that arises from the adrenal glands. The investigators have recently demonstrated that 11-oxygenated androgens make up the majority of circulating androgens in women with PCOS.\n\nIn preliminary studies using minimally invasive adipose tissue sampling, the investigators have found that the fat tissue of women with PCOS overproduces classic androgens. This can lead directly to disturbances in the ability of fat cells to store fat effectively (lipotoxicity), resulting in insulin resistance and the consequent risk of liver damage. However, there are no published studies on in vivo androgen concentrations in the adipose tissue of women with PCOS. Furthermore, the scientific community do not have any information on whether adipose concentrations of 11-oxygenated androgens are also increased in women with PCOS.\n\nResearch Questions The investigators aim to examine the metabolism of classic and 11-oxygenated androgens in detail in both circulations and in the adipose tissue of women with PCOS. The investigators will examine how precursor variants of both 11-oxygenated and classic androgens, which are converted by the body into active hormones, are broken down (metabolised) within the adipose tissue of women with PCOS. The investigators will also investigate if the 11-oxygenated androgens have a differential impact on metabolic function as compared to classic androgens. This will give important insights into the adipose tissue metabolome in women with PCOS, and how locally generated androgens impact on adipose tissue function and metabolic risk.",
    "detailed_description": "In part A of the study, women with PCOS and obesity, identified from the previously established DAISy-PCOS cohort, and age- and BMI-matched healthy volunteers identified by advertisements, will be invited for a screening visit (Visit 1) at the National Institute of Health Research-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham. Once eligibility (described in detail in Section 7.1) has been confirmed, a written informed consent will be obtained, and the volunteers will be invited to three further metabolic assessment visits after an overnight fast.\n\nWhile Visits 2 and 3 (Study days 1 and 2, respectively) will be for the assessment of responses to an androgen-precursor challenge, Visit 4 (Study day 3) will run in the same format as the previous two Study days except no androgen will be administered. During each visit, study participants will undergo abdominal adipose tissue vein cannulation, whereby a catheter will be inserted (under ultrasound guidance and with local anaesthetic) into one of the veins of the abdominal fat tissue. Ultrasound Doppler and ethanol dilution by microdialysis will be employed to assess adipose tissue blood flow. A further catheter will be inserted into a vein on the back of the hand which will be placed a hot air box in order to obtain arterialised blood. Finally, a catheter will be inserted into an antecubital vein for the purposes of stable isotope infusion. Blood samples from the hand vein and from the abdominal adipose tissue vein will be taken in tandem every 30 minutes for measurement of various metabolites, androgens, and non-targeted metabolome studies. Salivary samples will be collected every 30 minutes in the first hour and hourly thereafter until the end of the study. Urine will be collected throughout the Study Visit. At time point 240 min, a standardised high-fat meal containing palmitate labelled with a stable isotope will be given to the participant, and measurements will continue, to assess how their metabolism responds to the meal. Furthermore, fat tissue biopsies will be taken from the subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue at the end of each study day. These fat biopsies will undergo RNA extraction for transcriptional profiling by RNA-sequencing and will be used for tissue incubation to determine their androgen-generating and metabolic capacity.\n\nOn Visits 2 and 3, participants will be administered either the classic androgen pathway precursor dehydroepiandrosterone or the 11-oxygenated androgen pathway precursor 11-ketoandrostenedione at time point 0 min. No androgen precursors will be administered during Visit 4. Otherwise, Visits 2-4 will be identical in their flow.\n\nIn part B of the study, paired subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue samples (up to 5 g), as well as a blood sample, are collected from female volunteers undergoing elective abdominal surgery. These tissue samples alongside the subcutaneous tissue obtained from the in vivo study (part A) will be used for ex vivo incubations with androgen precursors to study androgen activation and its metabolic impact. Additionally, the effect of Aldo-Keto Reductase Family 1 Member C3 inhibition on androgen activation will be assessed in ex vivo incubations. After the incubation, the culture medium and/or the tissue will be used for metabolome analysis (non-targeted global metabolome and steroid metabolome profiling) and transcriptome analysis. The blood sample will be used for serum multi-steroid profiling.",

The usual approach for patients at increased risk for breast cancer is to undergo yearly breast magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound in addition to yearly mammogram. Premenopausal women at very high lifetime risk for breast cancer (greater than 50%) can consider preventive removal (mastectomy) of both breasts. Premenopausal women age 35 or older with a prior diagnosis of atypical hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ, or an estimated 10-year risk of greater than or equal to 3% or estimated 10-year risk of greater than or equal to 2-5 times that of the average woman (depending on age) may be advised to consider five years of standard dose tamoxifen. Standard dose tamoxifen is four times the dose used in this study. Estrogen can cause the development and growth of breast cancer cells. Acolbifene and tamoxifen blocks the use of estrogen by breast cells. This study may help researchers measure the effects of acolbifene and low dose tamoxifen on markers of breast cancer risk in mammogram imaging, breast tissue, and in blood samples.",

Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that starts in melanocytes, the cells that make the pigment that gives skin its color. In people with cancer, the body cannot control the growth of cells, which can come together to form tumors. This trial's new treatment is called BI-1607. BI-1607 is designed to work by improving the effectiveness of other targeted therapies already used for melanoma treatment; ipilimumab and pembrolizumab. BI-1607 will improve the ability of these two treatments to help the body's defense system to destroy cancer cells.",
    "detailed_description": "Trial Participants: This trial will include an estimated number of 35 participants with melanoma cancer who have not been helped by standard treatments.\n\nThe main purposes of this trial are :\n\n1. To learn about the safety and tolerability of BI1607 when received in combination with ipilimumab and pembrolizumab,\n2. To determine the best dose (quantity) of both BI-1607 and ipilimumab when combined with pembrolizumab, and\n3. To see if this triple combination therapy of BI-1607/ipilimumab/ pembrolizumab is more effective.\n\nTo investigate this, the researchers will study:\n\n* what medical problems can happen during the trial, whether there are changes in the participants' health, how many participants reduce their dose of treatment or stop treatment for a period during the trial, and how many participants have medical problems that cause them to stop their trial treatment early.\n* how many participants have dose-limiting toxicities (also called \"DLTs\", which are medical problems severe enough to stop the trial doctors from increasing a treatment dose in the next group of participants).\n\n  2. The researchers will also study the following additional questions in this trial:\n* how BI-1607 acts in the body when received with ipilimumab/pembrolizumab.\n* whether the triple combination at varying doses of BI-1607 and ipilimumab acts in the participants' bodies as expected and has a desired effect on certain proteins in the participants' immune systems.\n* the number of participants who produce \"antibodies\" against BI-1607 and tolerability. Antibodies are proteins which are part of the immune system that help fight an infection. However, the body can produce antibodies against a treatment, which can stop the treatment from working properly.\n* how many participants' tumors shrink after receiving BI-1607 in combination with ipilimumab/pembrolizumab, and how long do their tumors shrink before their melanoma get worse or they pass away.\n\nWhat is planned to happen during this trial: The participants are planned to be in this trial for a maximum of 25.5 months. This trial started end of 2024 and is planned to end in 2028.\n\nThis trial will have 2 parts, called Phase 1 and Phase 2.\n\nIn Phase 1, at least 15 participants will receive BI-1607 and ipilimumab once every three weeks over four treatment time points, i.e., 12 weeks. Pembrolizumab will be added to the combination treatment at the third and fourth treatment. If the participant continues in the trial thereafter, pembrolizumab will be administered alone every third week from the fifth week onwards, up to a total of 35 treatments or approximately 2 years. This phase 1 will likely contain 4 groups of participants receiving different dose levels of treatments. After the participants in the first dose group have received their first treatments, the Sponsor, in collaboration with researchers, decides if this dose is safe, and the dose will be increased in the next group of participants.\n\nIn Phase 2, approximately 20 participants will receive BI-1607 at the selected dose that the Sponsor and researchers decide is safe during Phase 1. BI-1607 will be administered once every three weeks in combination with both ipilimumab and pembrolizumab over four treatment time points, i.e., 12 weeks. Thereafter, pembrolizumab will be administered alone every third week, up to a total of 35 treatments or approximately 2 years.\n\nIn both phases, the treatments will be administered via an \"IV infusion\" in which an IV line is inserted into a vein usually in the arm. The treatments will be dosed in milligrams, also called \"mg\". The lowest dose of BI-1607 will be 350 mg, and the highest possible dose will be 700 mg. Ipilimumab will be given to participants at a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight or 3 mg/kg. The dose of pembrolizumab will be 200 mg.\n\nThroughout the trial, the researchers will check the participants' health and any medical problems, ask about any medications they are receiving, take blood, tumor, and urine samples, and scan their tumors. The researchers will do these tests to learn how safe BI-1607 is in combination with ipilimumab/pembrolizumab, how the drug acts in the body, and how the treatment affects the participants' tumors.\n\nBenefits of this trial: There is no guarantee that the participants will receive any benefit from participating in this trial. However, their participation may help other people who have melanoma receive better care in the future.\n\nRisks of this trial: Participant safety is the most important factor in clinical trials. However, it cannot be guaranteed that the participants will not have medical problems during this trial. The clinical researcher will determine if the participant should no longer take part in the study if the results show the treatment doses are not safe. The Sponsor, Ethics Committee, or Regulatory Authority may also decide to stop the study at any time for any reason.",

The results will provide important data for the future COVID 19 vaccine strategy.\n\nA biobank will also be set up to evaluate the protection conferred by one or other of these vaccines as booster in the event of the emergence of new variants in the future.",
    "detailed_description": "The efficacy of COVID 19 vaccines for reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 infection is demonstrated in real life.\n\nHowever, data currently available on the persistence of immunity after vaccination on the one hand and the emergence of viral variants with reduced sensibility to vaccine immunity on the other, raise the need to administer boosters to maintain the protection and to compare different strategies as bivalent mRNA vaccines but also others platforms.\n\nThe vaccines currently recommended as boosters in France are mRNA bivalent vaccines, adapted to better match the circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 and expected to provide broader protection against Omicron sub variants (19). However, the rapid antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the antigenic imprinting against the initial Hu-1 strain could reduce their effectiveness.\n\nMore recently, the Beta-variant recombinant protein booster vaccine (VidPrevtyn Beta, Sanofi) obtained European authorization and is recommended in France as booster as an alternative to the bivalent mRNA vaccines (21, 22). However, in the absence of comparative data with the bivalent mRNA vaccines, VidPrevtyn Beta is recommended as second line.\n\nIt has been shown with vectored vaccines that a heterologous vaccination scheme could be more immunogenic than a homologous scheme (23). Our group previously showed that VidPrevtyn Beta, administered as a third vaccine dose, induces higher immune response than the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine (Comirnaty, BioNTech-Pfizer), against Beta variant but also others variants of concern (VOC) including Omicron BA1 (20) and Omicron BA4/5 (data submitted for publication). The data available at 3 and 6 months after the boost, show that VidPrevtyn Beta could be also of interest in term of durability of the response (data not published). The hypothesis is that a Beta variant protein recombinant vaccine could enlarge the protection against the variants by overpassing antigenic imprinting and the adjuvant improve the duration of immune response and protection. Moreover, the Beta-variant recombinant protein vaccine could bring an advantage in terms of reactogenicity, acceptability, cost and accessibility.\n\nIn this context, as recently pointed by the HAS, comparative data on immunogenicity and reactogenicity between a bivalent mRNA vaccine and the Beta-variant recombinant protein, both administered as boosters, are needed to better adapt the COVID 19 vaccine recommendations for the future.\n\nThis study is Comparative, non-inferiority, single-blinded, multicenter, randomized trial.\n\nRandomization in a 1:1 ratio, will be stratified by age (18-60 years and \u2265 60 years of age) and history of SARS-CoV-2 infection",

    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential recovery of heart function in end-stage heart failure patients supported with a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) through applying a myocardial conditioning protocol. During myocardial conditioning, LVAD speed is reduced gradually in order to increase the work load of the heart. Multiple previous studies have shown that interventions like this may improve heart function and give patients the opportunity for a better quality of life.",
    "detailed_description": "Heart failure can be caused by various disorders, such as myocardial infarction, hypertension, viral infection, exposure to toxins, chemotherapy, or genetically transmitted muscular diseases. Regardless of the etiology, these disorders initiate ventricular remodeling, an adaptive, compensatory process which becomes progressively maladaptive and the cause of functional and clinical deterioration, eventually leading to heart failure. Local and systemic compensatory responses that initially allow surviving muscle to maintain hemodynamic function continue over time and due to this persistent compensatory over-activity the initially unaffected myocardium becomes dysfunctional. These compensatory responses to an abnormal cardiac load or myocardial injury involve several pathophysiological adaptations in the cardiac structure at the genetic, molecular, cellular, and tissue levels. Furthermore, left ventricular pressure and volume overload has shown to alter metabolic substrate utilization, decrease mitochondrial function and reduce energy production in the failing heart.\n\nMechanical circulatory support with LVAD has become a standard bridge to cardiac transplantation, and has also been approved in the United States as permanent (destination) therapy for selected patients presenting with end-stage heart failure. Clinical experience with LVAD support has shown that it can reverse the complex process of chronic left ventricular remodeling to a point where a subset of patients could be weaned from the device after restoration of basic cardiac function. LVAD-induced mechanical unloading of the failing heart leads to reduced mitochondrial density, structure and function, and interventions that enhance mitochondrial biogenesis, function and structure, such as controlled cardiac reloading may enhance LVAD-induced myocardial reverse remodeling and cardiac recovery. This study is designed to investigate gradual reduction in LVAD speed within the range defined by the assist device manufacturer's manual as appropriate for regular clinic use, to determine the effect on reverse remodeling and myocardial recovery in end-stage heart failure patients.",

    "brief_summary": "This project uses both transcriptomic- and genomic-level data to identify mechanisms of individual responses to glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in Mexican-Americans with prediabetes. The GLP-1 hormone is essential for glucose reduction, weight loss, cardiovascular risk reduction, and renal protection. Newly discovered mechanisms will illuminate causal links between disease genotype and phenotype, which may ultimately guide personalized therapeutic approaches for type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and other related diseases.",
    "detailed_description": "This clinical trial will uncover new mechanisms of inter-individual responses to endogenous and exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in Hispanics/Latinos (H/Ls) with prediabetes. The results move the management of prediabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and relevant metabolic diseases to a more individualized approach in an understudied and at-risk population. Few options exist for prediabetes treatment, and the current pharmaceutical management of T2DM does not predict drug treatment failures, nor differences in individual treatment responses and adverse effects. A precise, genetics-based approach will provide superior therapeutic management for patients. GLP-1-based therapies reduce blood glucose, promote weight loss, decrease cardiovascular events, and improve renal function. Prior genetic studies, most done in Caucasians, identified associations between genetic variants and decreased GLP-1-induced insulin secretion, in an effort to guide individualized treatment. However, these associations do not provide a clear mechanistic relationship between genotype and phenotype. Transcriptomic analyses will uncover many of these mechanisms. Here, we propose to 1) test the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that regulate expression (eQTLs) of 11 candidate genes in a range of relevant metabolic tissues with differential GLP-1 response, 2) perform RNA sequencing before and after treatment to identify eQTLs in blood that predict response to GLP-1 therapy and develop risk-based prediction models in H/Ls, and 3) determine the effects of genetic regulation of candidate genes and newly discovered eQTLs phenome-wide in a large existing biobank, BioVU. For aims 1 and 2, responses will be measured in 300 study subjects with prediabetes recruited from an established Mexican-American cohort via the oral minimal model method, before and after GLP-1 therapy, quantifying GLP-1 hormone efficacy and GLP-1-induced pancreatic beta cell insulin release and peripheral insulin sensitivity. Procedures include serial measurements of plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and GLP-1, and peripheral blood collection for RNA sequencing. Our central hypotheses are: (1) metabolic tissue-based eQTLs of GLP-1-associated genes will be associated with physiological response to endogenous and exogenous GLP-1,(2) identification of eQTLs associated with GLP-1 treatment-induced changes in whole blood will identify new gene targets, and (3) this data will lead to the creation of eQTL-based prediction models for related diseases. The study is innovative because it uses a novel combination of eQTL analysis and oral minimal model to assess GLP-1 response, examines a population highly underrepresented in pharmacogenomic studies, and utilizes novel statistical methods and applications to study gene expression. The significance of this newly acquired mechanistic information will ultimately guide precision therapeutic regimens for diabetes prevention and treatment, weight loss, cardiovascular risk reduction, and related metabolic complications in an understudied population.",

This is a phase IV vaccine trial that looks to establish if two licenced vaccines, the rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine for protection against Ebola virus and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) COVID vaccine for protection against SARS-CoV-2 virus, given concurrently to self selected healthy adult volunteers confers an acceptable safety profile and immunogenicity response.",
    "detailed_description": "Vaccines for the prevention of severe disease caused by Ebola virus and SARS-CoV-2 virus are routinely offered to adults at higher risk of exposure in African settings. For protection from Ebola virus, the main target populations are epidemiologically-identified and include healthcare workers, refugees, and people living in outbreak zones. These target populations are also routinely offered vaccines for other vaccine-preventable diseases. However, there are currently no data on whether the co-administration of rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP with other vaccines has an acceptable profile of reactogenicity and antigen-specific immunogenicity, and concomitant use of rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP with other vaccines is not recommended. Clinical trial data on the co-administration of rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP with other vaccines prioritised for the same population, and especially in the context of a new era in mRNA vaccine technology, would have significant relevance to how protection to more than one disease can be provided at a single visit to a vaccination clinic. This, in turn, has the potential to improve vaccine coverage and improve the efficiency of vaccine policy and logistics, as well as being the first step evaluation in the evaluation of Vesicular stomatitis virus-vectored vaccine technology with lipid-enveloped mRNA platforms that are going to be increasingly used in other formulations against other/future infectious diseases targets.\n\nThere are no preliminary data in this first-of-kind study.\n\nThe advent of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 pandemic signalled the accelerated development of lipid-nanoparticle mRNA vaccine technology with great success. The mRNA platform is highly adaptable to new disease targets, including cancer and infectious diseases pathogens, and a multitude of vaccine candidates are currently in development for outstanding global health priorities that have eluded pre-pandemic technologies. However, there remains very little known about using mRNA technologies in combination with, or concurrent to, other vaccine technologies and whether there are any adverse signals associated with safety or antigen-specific immune response/protection. Earlier trials have focussed on using SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in combination with adjuvant-protein vaccines for seasonal influenza (and herpes-zoster virus, in setup) and have reported favourable safety and humoral immune responses that has resulted in recommended concurrent vaccine dose administration into the annual seasonal vaccination schedule of UK nationals. These study data have significantly supported public confidence in accepting two licenced vaccines at the same time and significant efficiency gains in vaccine coverage and public protection. The concurrent administration of mRNA vaccines with attenuated or replication-incompetent viral-vectored vaccines has not, to our knowledge, been assessed although many trials reported favourable safety and immunogenicity with heterologous combinations of these vaccine platforms for protection against COVID-19. Since existing mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and new mRNA constructs against other infectious diseases are expected to become routine immunisations for key members of the population, such as healthcare workers and older adults, research is needed to inform whether concurrent or co-administration with other vaccines are possible. For African populations, the risk of disease outbreaks from Ebola remains high and the future use of rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP is expected, along with other measures, to mitigate the risks to healthcare workers and the wider public. Assessing the safety and immunogenicity of rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine in the context of expected gains in public confidence and policy implementation with co-administration with mRNA vaccine technologies is a major subject of interest for African populations and preparedness for future disease outbreaks.\n\nThis is a single-centre, randomized, single-blinded, vaccine safety and immunogenicity study in healthy adults living in Rwanda. The EbolaCov trial aims to inform whether the Ebola vaccine rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV-GP can be administered concurrent to a BioNTech - Pfizer COVID-19 booster dose without an unacceptable increase in reactogenicity and/or loss of humoral immunogenicity to Ebola vaccine antigen.\n\nThe investigators aim to primarily recruit participants who are current healthcare workers, although the study will be open all eligible members of the public. Participants of both genders aged 18-50 years who are in good health and who are able to provide written informed consent, will be eligible for inclusion in this study. The recruitment target is recruit 72 participants who will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to one of two groups.\n\nThere will be four study visits over 6 months. Participants will be monitored for any reactions and other adverse events for 7 days after each immunisation via self reported e-diary, and for significant adverse events throughout the study.\n\nThe geometric mean titre (GMT) and antigen-specific antibody titre will be measured by glycoprotein-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline, 28-days and 180-days after vaccination.",

It is currently used for diagnostic, prognostic and predictive purposes of response or resistance to oncological treatments. These advances in ctDNA have been made possible by major developments in molecular biology techniques in recent years, as the detection of ctDNA requires very sensitive techniques such as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS).\n\nCtDNA overcomes this problem of very limiting tumor heterogeneity during a solid biopsy. All of these applications make circulating DNA an increasingly essential tool in the management of cancer patients. The studies are currently in most cases on small numbers and are retrospective.\n\nIn addition, exosomes are also a biomarker of the future that can also be detected in the bloodstream . Exosomes are nanovesicles 50 to 200 nm in diameter released into the extracellular environment via the endosomal pathway by fusion with the plasma membrane. They are very informative since they transport tumor genetic material in the form of DNA, mRNA and miRNA, but also adhesion proteins, immunostimulatory molecules and cytoskeleton, enzymes and Heats shock proteins ( HSP).\n\nThe aim of the ADIGYN study is to set up a large prospective cohort to assess the diagnostic, prognostic and predictive impact of ctDNA and exosomes in digestive and gynecological / breast cancers. From the circulating DNA, we characterize the ActDNA on the molecular level thanks to the study of different point mutations usually used but also of new described mutations having a therapeutic impact and the search for other genetic alterations having an impact on the therapeutic strategy (such as microsatellite instability) or the study of exosomes and their composition. To assess resistance to oncological treatments, ctDNA will be analyzed at the start of treatment, during treatment, during progression and / or relapse and also during monitoring or treatment break",

Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, collectively affect about 344 million individuals worldwide, (24 million with schizophrenia, 40 million people with BD, and 280 million with depression World Health Organization). These illnesses are debilitating psychiatric conditions characterized by a chronic pattern of emotional, behavioral, and cognitive disturbances. Shared psychopathology includes the pre-eminence of altered affective states, disorders of thoughts, and behavioral control. Additionally, those conditions share epidemiological traits, including significant cardiovascular, metabolic, infectious, and respiratory comorbidities, resulting in reduced life expectancy of up to 25 years (Xie et al., 2023). Reductions in cerebral glucose uptake are seen in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While glucose is the brain's default fuel, ketone bodies are 27% more efficient, improve brain metabolism, and promote neural stability, as seen in childhood epilepsy (Sethi \\& Ford, 2022). The ketogenic diet (KD, also known as metabolic therapy) has been successful in the treatment of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and epilepsy (Sethi et al., 2024, Liu et al., 2018, Martin-McGill et al., 2020). Nutritional ketosis has been successfully used to treat a range of neurological disorders. Metabolic disorders, which include conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome, more commonly occur in individuals with severe mental illness (between 40-60%). We aim to study the effect of ketogenic metabolic therapy on various markers including:\n\n* Metabolic health measurements and cardiovascular risk factors including: insulin resistance, advanced lipid analysis, weight, glucose regulation, dyslipidemia, absolute body fat chang, inflammation, waist circumference, blood pressure, skeletal muscle mass, and omega index\n* Psychiatric symptom measures include: mood, psychosis, cognition, and quality of life\n* Deep omic profiling including metabolic and proteomic data. Through identifying patterns, changes, and pathways of molecular, psychiatric, physiologic, and metabolic markers, we aim to assess how this intervention may impact individuals with serious mental illnesses and symptoms/conditions related to serious mental illnesses.",

    "detailed_description": "Atopic dermatitis is a debilitating chronic inflammatory disease with substantial health and economic impact, affecting 10-20% of the U.S. population with an estimated annual direct health care cost of $13 billion. There is much to still discover regarding the dysfunctional skin barrier underlying AD and its effects on quality of life, highlighting a critical health care cap. AD manifests as erythematous and pruritic plaques often in flexural regions of the body, but may also be widespread as well. AD patients suffer from high rates of mental health disorders and often report a poor quality of life (QoL).\n\nThe pathogenesis of AD is multifactorial, involving both genetic and environmental components. Specifically, a defect in the filaggrin gene is a common etiology. Moreover, it is thought that decreased levels of ceramides within the epidermis allow for an abnormal amount of transepidermal water loss leading to an increased Th2 response and subsequently, overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-5. Additionally, scratching of the epidermis promotes increased levels of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha from keratinocytes.\n\nThe objective of this pilot study is to determine whether cutaneous neurons are required for the maintenance of atopic dermatitis (AD) lesions. The significance derives from the potential to reveal novel neuro-immune pathways that could provide suitable targets for future therapeutic approaches for this disease. Specifically, the investigators hypothesize that neurotransmitters released from cutaneous neurons are required for the persistence of AD lesions. This is supported by a prior report showing that injection of botulinum toxin which prevents vesicular fusion in neurons and hence neurotransmitter release led to clinical improvement and resolution of AD lesions. Similar findings have been reported with Psoriasis. The investigators approach will analyze biopsy samples from AD patients treated with botulinum toxin using spatial single cell imaging.\n\nThe project will be performed in 2 phases. Phase 1a will include a pilot run of spatial single cell imaging performed on normal skin and with atopic dermatitis. In Phase 1b, the investigators will administer intradermal botulinum toxin in AD lesions to determine the kinetics of the clinical response when neurotransmitter release is inhibited using standardized clinical outcome assessments, including Physician Global Assessment (PGA) and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). The kinetics, or time, to reduction of lesion severity, as determined in Phase 1b, will be used in Phase 2 to determine the biopsy visits.\n\nPhase 2 will test the hypothesis that botulinum toxin therapy alters the cellular and molecular state of AD lesions, specifically by blocking neuroimmune interactions with a specific emphasis of cytokine and chemokine interactions. In Phase 2, botulinum toxin will be injected into multiple lesions in a small cohort of AD patients. Based on the results of Phase 1b, skin biopsies will be harvested at 3 different times and analyzed using spatial single cell imaging.\n\nIt is expected that these experiments will implicate neuroimmune interactions in the pathogenesis of AD and serve as proof-of-concept for design of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of botulinum toxin to reduce inflammation, lesion severity, and improve quality of life for AD patients. Once patients are clear, inhibition of neurotransmitter release could be used to prevent recurrence thereby avoiding long-term immunosuppression and its associated risks.",

For patients waiting for surgery or those not eligible for operative treatment, conservative treatment is recommended. In cases of minor injuries, physiotherapy is as effective as surgical intervention.\n\nThe aim of this study is: (1) to compare the speed, effectiveness, and durability of four implemented interventions in improving sleep quality, pain, and shoulder function, (2) to select the most optimal form of conservative treatment for patients with shoulder pain affecting sleep quality, and (3) to evaluate the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and proBDNF (precursor) at the mRNA protein level before the planned intervention (T0), 1 month (T1), 3 months (T3), and 6 months (T6) after intervention.\n\nThe study results can assist physicians and physiotherapists in providing patients with therapy that not only relieves pain and improves function but also augments sleep quality, an aspect often overlooked in the literature yet greatly impacting patients\\&#39; quality of life.",

    "brief_summary": "The primary objective of this study is to determine whether extended-release MF (in addition to standard of care (S-o-C)) is superior to placebo in reducing podocyte injury and promoting podocyte survival by 6-months in Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).",
    "detailed_description": "Focal Segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is currently the most common primary glomerular disease that progresses to ESKD in the US. FSGS is typified by significant proteinuria, and by disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton of highly specialized epithelial cells which support the glomerular capillary loop called podocytes. Podocytes are characterized by foot processes, whose disorganization with injury is visualized on electron microscopy as foot process effacement (FPE). Podocytes are also incapable of self-renewal, and podocyte loss over \\~40% per glomerulus leads to proteinuria, the nephrotic syndrome (NS) and FSGS. Such critical podocyte loss alone is sufficient for progressive CKD and ESKD. Currently, the reported rate of complete and/or partial response is 40-70% in various series with a rate of progression to ESKD 30-53% in 5-10 years.\n\nDistinct from FSGS, Minimal Change Disease (MCD), which despite showing similar diffuse FPE and NS, has preserved podocyte numbers and rare progression to ESKD (5-20% in 20 years). MCD can be morphologically indistinguishable from early FSGS, and some MCD cases reportedly transition to FSGS. Hence, identifying and targeting mechanisms in MCD that specifically promote survival of injured podocytes with FPE, could help switch an FSGS phenotype to an \"MCD-like\" phenotype, and prevent or retard progression of FSGS. Currently, therapeutics in FSGS focus on immune modulation, or on hemodynamic interventions used in generically all cases of NS. Specific strategies to directly promote podocyte survival and limit podocytopenia to within the critical threshold during injury, have not been pursued clinically. Hence, many FSGS cases will progress to ESKD or encounter dose limiting side-effects of immune therapies (corticosteroids, or other agents), representing a significant therapeutic gap in the field.\n\nIn this context, MF is an Ampk-activator that is widely used, demonstrably safe, and inexpensive with reported renal benefit in diabetic and non-diabetic CKD. Its specific utility to promote cell survival of injured podocytes in FSGS has never been tested. Our preclinical data shows that an \"MCD-like\" pathology with podocyte injury/FPE transitioned to podocytopenia and FSGS by AMPK inhibition, while AMPK activation with MF mitigated podocytopenia in FSGS models.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to test whether Metformin use in individuals with FSGS as an adjunct to standard -of-care (corticosteroids, anti RAAS measures, BP control) is safe and will activate kidney cell AMPK and reduce podocyte injury. The primary objective is to determine whether extended-release MF (in addition to standard of care (S-o-C)) is superior to placebo in reducing podocyte injury and promoting podocyte survival by 6-months in Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Specifically, for this purpose, this study will primarily evaluate sequential urinary podocyte mRNA excretion to identify individual urinary mRNA trajectories representing podocyte injury/depletion and potential prognostic signals in the MF study limb vs control.\n\nA secondary objective of this study is to use multiple blood, urine and biopsy assays to test whether the addition of Metformin ( to S-o-C) mitigates kidney disease progression parameters superior to placebo. These assays will include large scale urine and serum protein profiling, protein and RNA tests performed in kidney biopsies.\n\nAnother secondary objective of this study is to test whether the addition of Metformin ( to S-o-C) is safe in patients with proteinuria and FSGS. This will be accomplished by specific questionnaires and blood tests geared towards MF-associated adverse effects.\n\nResults of this study will inform a larger, phase 2/3 randomized trial which will evaluate the efficacy of MF treatment versus placebo in attenuating proteinuria and kidney function decline in FSGS.",

    "brief_summary": "This study is a randomized controlled trial of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stove and fuel distribution in 3,200 households in four countries (India, Guatemala, Peru, and Rwanda). Following a common protocol, each intervention site will recruit 800 pregnant women (aged 18-34 years, 9 - \\<20 weeks gestation), and will randomly assign half their households to receive LPG stoves and an 18-month supply of LPG. Control households are anticipated to continue to cook primarily with solid biomass fuels, and will receive compensation based on a uniform set of trial-wide principles, customized to each site based on formative research. The mother will be followed along with her child until the child is 1 year old. The researchers estimate that 15% of households will have a second, non-pregnant older adult woman (aged 40 to \\<80 years) who will also be enrolled at baseline and followed during the 18-month follow-up period. To optimize intervention use, the researchers will implement behavior change strategies informed by previous experiences and formative research in Year 1. This study will assess cookstove use, conduct repeated personal exposure assessments of household air pollution, and collect dried blood spots and urinary samples for biomarker analysis and biospecimen storage. The primary outcomes are low birth weight, severe pneumonia incidence, and stunting of the child, and blood pressure in the older adult woman. Secondary outcomes include preterm birth and development in the child, maternal blood pressure during pregnancy, and endothelial function, respiratory impairment, atherosclerosis, carcinogenic metabolites, and quality of life in the older adult woman. Participants in India, Guatemala and Rwanda will be followed until the child is 5 years old to assess the longer-term effects of the intervention.",
    "detailed_description": "Globally, nearly 3 billion people rely on solid fuels for cooking and heating, the vast majority in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The resulting household air pollution (HAP) is the third leading risk factor in the 2010 global burden of disease, accounting for an estimated 4.3 million deaths annually, largely among women and young children. Previous interventions have provided cleaner biomass-based cookstoves, but have failed to reduce exposure to levels that produce meaningful health improvements. There have been no large-scale field trials with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cookstoves, likely the cleanest scalable intervention.\n\nThe aim of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of LPG stove and fuel distribution in 3,200 households in four LMICs (India, Guatemala, Peru, and Rwanda) to deliver rigorous evidence regarding potential health benefits across the lifespan. Each intervention site will recruit 800 pregnant women (aged 18-34 years, 9 - \\<20 weeks gestation), and will randomly assign half their households to receive LPG stoves and an 18-month supply of LPG. Control households are anticipated to continue to cook primarily with solid biomass fuels, and will receive compensation based on a uniform set of trial-wide principles, customized to each site based on formative research. The mother will be followed along with her child until the child is 1 year old. In households with a second, non-pregnant older adult woman (aged 40 to \\<80 years) the researchers will also enroll and follow her during the 18-month follow-up period in order to assess cardiopulmonary, metabolic, and cancer outcomes. To optimize intervention use, the researchers will implement behavior change strategies. This study will assess cookstove use, conduct repeated personal exposure assessments to HAP (PM2.5, black carbon, carbon monoxide), and collect dried blood spots and urinary samples for biomarker analysis and biospecimen storage on all participants at multiple time points. The primary outcomes are low birth weight, severe pneumonia incidence, and stunting of the child, and blood pressure in the older adult woman. Secondary outcomes include preterm birth and development in the child, maternal blood pressure during pregnancy, and endothelial function, respiratory impairment, atherosclerosis, carcinogenic metabolites, and quality of life in the older adult woman.\n\nThis study will address the following specific aims: (1) using an intent-to-treat analysis, determine the effect of a randomized LPG stove and fuel intervention on health in four diverse LMIC populations using a common protocol; (2) determine the exposure-response relationships for HAP and health outcomes; and (3) determine relationships between LPG intervention and both targeted and exploratory biomarkers of exposure/health effects.\n\nThis study will provide evidence, including costs and implementation strategies, to inform national and global policies on scaling up LPG stoves among vulnerable populations. Ultimately, this will facilitate deeper policy-level discussions as well as identify requirements for initiating and sustaining HAP interventions globally.\n\nThe intervention delivery occurred until the child was one year of age. The researchers will continue to follow participants in India, Guatemala and Rwanda until the child is 5 years old to assess the longer-term effects of the intervention. Previous evidence suggests that the benefits of reduced exposure during the first, critical year of development will continue even if the intervention ends. The researchers will continue using methods employed during the HAPIN trial period. The HAPIN trial provides a unique context in which to address these questions, particularly given the successful intervention and exposure reduction. Participants are well-characterized and health and exposures to air pollution are being documented. Critically, because of its experimental design of the trial, continued follow-up of the cohort will provide rigorous causal inferences about the effects of this 500-day intervention over the most important period of early childhood development.",

Rikshospitalet. Investigators will search for answers along three pathways: Can SGLT2 inhibitor 1) preserve glomerular filtration rate (GFR), 2) reduce interstitial fibrosis in the kidney, and 3) favorably improve metabolic risk factors for graft failure such as visceral obesity, glucose intolerance and high blood pressure? The participants (N=330) will be randomized to either dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo o.d. in a blinded fashion. Researchers will than use kidney transplant biopsies, measured GFR, blood pressure sampling, glucose tolerance test (OGTT), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA scan) and estimated GFR from the two groups in comparison, to evaluate the effect treatment. The participants will be followed for a total of 3 years.",
    "detailed_description": "This is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with dapagliflozin 10 mg vs. placebo o.d. in kidney transplant patients. The patients are randomized 1:1 to active: placebo treatment 6 weeks after transplantation and followed for a total of 150 weeks (156 weeks post-transplant).\n\nBefore treatment initiation (6 weeks after transplantation) the following investigations will be performed;\n\n1. Estimated GFR: Assessed using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease 4 (MDRD-4) formula and is presented as mL/min/1.73 m2. Plasma creatinine concentrations are to be analyzed at the Department of Medical Biochemistry where the patient is followed and is presented as mmol/L. (Estimated GFR will be calculated from at least 4 plasma creatinine measurements per year).\n2. Blood sample: Measured variables include plasma creatinine, hemoglobin, hematocrit, sodium, potassium, magnesium and uric acid.\n3. Kidney tissue analyses: a.) Light microscopical evaluation in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) kidney graft biopsies: Semi-quantitative estimation of percent graft fibrosis in the renal cortex according to the Banff classification, percent interstitial fibrosis and percent inflammation outside fibrotic scars. b.) Immunohistochemistry: Graft samples will be deparaffinized and boiled in antigen retrieval solution and then exposed to primary antibodies against collagen and extracellular matrix markers, e.g. periostin, tenascin and picrosirius red. In addition, p16INKa, a marker of premature aging, and endothelial markers to evaluate capillary density will be used.\n\n   c.) Samples will be digitally scanned to perform digital morphometric evaluation using the softwares 3D Histech, Analysis Pro and QuPath. Areas not of interest (renal medulla, scar tissue, capsule or subscapular areas), poor quality scans and artefacts will be excluded. Digital software will also be used to estimate glomerular volume and mesangial volume fraction using QuPath. All evaluations will be performed by investigators blinded for the study participants' identity and clinical data. This is an explorative study, and no power estimate is available.\n\n   d.) The investigators will also perform molecular analyses, mRNA and proteomics in a subsample (n=25 in intervention, n=25 in control group, matched for age, gender and eGFR as appropriate) at the same two time-points as described above (altogether n=100 biopsies processed for RNA sequencing and proteomics), using standard bulk mRNA/miRNA sequencing and proteomics of whole sections from 'RNA later' kidney graft biopsies (Genomics and Proteomics Core Facilities, UiO). The investigators will also perform bioinformatic analyses focusing on fibrosis.\n4. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): Will be performed in persons not on glucose-lowering treatment by ingestion of 75 g glucose dissolved in water (or 1 g/kg if body weight is \\<75 kg). Blood samples for measurements of glucose, insulin and C-peptide are collected at 0, 30 and 120 min, respectively. Glucose tolerance is assessed by the 2-h glucose value, while first phase insulin release is primarily reflected by the 30 min insulin value which is included in the Stumvoll equation which measures both first and second phase insulin release. Insulin sensitivity will be assessed by the Matsuda equation.\n5. Protein/creatinine ratio: Will be assessed at the Department of Medical Biochemistry where the patient is followed. Open urinary stix is not considered appropriate, partly due to the risk of unblinding in case of glucosuria detection by a combined stix. (Protein/ creatinine ratio will be collected from at least 4 urine sample measurements per year)\n6. Blood Pressure: Will be assessed as both systolic and diastolic measure, and measurements are performed according to standard procedures (measured in mmHg ). The same standard will be followed for blood pressure measurements at the local hospitals.\n7. Metabolomics: Urine and serum will be sent on dry ice in larger batches. LC-MS methodology will be used for the analysis, using a commercial kit (Biocrates). ELISA methodology will in addition be used in case verification analyses are necessary. This exploratory analysis will focus on markers for fibrosis, inflammation and secretion function in the kidney tubuli.\n\n   After 2 weeks the patients will go through repeated blood sampling and blood pressure measurements, followed by the following procedures;\n8. Measured GFR: Assessed at the Laboratory for Renal Physiology, by the iohexol serum clearance method utilizing the Bayesian estimate 4-point method. Serum samples are to be obtained 10 min, 30 min, 2 h and 5 h after administration of 5 mL Omnipaque (300 mg I/mL). measured GFR (Iohexol serum clearance) and DXA assessed body composition (subcutaneous and visceral fat percentage of total fat mass) is assessed, after 72 weeks of treatment all investigations/biobanking performed before and after 2 weeks are repeated. Then, after 150 weeks, the final visit is performed, including blood pressure measurements and the urinary protein/creatinine ratio and clinical chemistry determinations.\n9. DXA scan: Total body composition will be determined by a narrow fan-beam Lunar Prodigy Densitometer (GE Healthcare) and all the scans will be analysed using enCORER software version 14.10 (GE Medical Systems, Lunar Corp., Madison, WI). The automated software is capable of discriminating subcutaneus adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) within android region of interest (ROI). In vivo, short-term coefficients of variation for total body tissue and lean and fat mass are 0.1%, 0.8%, and 2.5%. The VAT short-term repeat measurement error coefficient of variation is 9.8% DXA-derived VAT was previously validated against CT, the standard method for the quantitative assessment of intra abdominal adipose tissue.\n\nAt week 78 patients will go through repeated analyses of the tests listed above. They will also go through 24 hour blood pressure tests 8 weeks, 72 weeks and 150 weeks after randomization.\n\nThroughout the study all plasma creatinine and urinary protein/creatinine ratios will be included in the study clinical research form (CRF). Safety measures will also be included. Measured GFR will measure the chronic GFR slope, while estimated GFR will assess the total GFR slope (both the early dip and the chronic slope of GFR). Furthermore, after the final study visit, which represents150 weeks of blinded treatment, all patients will be allowed further open treatment with SGLT2-inhibitors to the discretion of the treating physician and the patient. Furthermore, eGFR slope, graft loss and cardiovascular events will be followed based on annual data from the Norwegian Renal Registry for up to 10 years after transplantation.\n\nFor a more detailed description of primary and secondary objectives and endpoints see bellow.",

Survival rates of patients with relapsed disease remain below 35%. For recurrent disease, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only known potentially curative treatment. However, a prerequisite to HSCT is obtaining a complete remission, which remains a significant challenge as only 40 to 50% of patients achieve a second remission with current reinduction regimens with salvage rates even lower for patients with disease that is refractory to first-line chemotherapy.\n\nBEAM-201 is an allogeneic anti-CD7 CAR T cell product that has shown promising early evidence of efficacy, with 3 out of 4 adult T-ALL patients infused had a CRi/CR \u226528 days after infusion. Safety of BEAM-201 has been favorable and consistent with known adverse events associated with other CAR T cell therapies.\n\nGiven the current treatment landscape of T-ALL/T-LLy, promising clinical experience with BEAM-201, and that \\>98% of T-ALL cases highly and homogenously express CD7 protein on the surfaces of their lymphoblasts, the investigators think there is compelling rationale in further investigating the safety and efficacy of BEAM-201 in pediatric patients.",

    "detailed_description": "Background: The accrual of population immunity to COVID-19 could allow life to return to pre- pandemic normality. Immunity can be acquired through natural infections or, preferably, by vaccination. An unprecedented global effort has succeeded in developing a number of COVID-19 vaccines. All vaccines against COVID-19 approved until now have originally been developed as either a single dose or following a homologous two-dose regimen. Inactivated COVID-19 vaccines have shown inferior immunogenicity compared to mRNA vaccines but there are no studies looking into the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety profile of mRNA vaccination provided as a booster dose in individuals who have previously received two doses of an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nAims and Objectives: The aims of this study are: (1) to determine whether one dose of mRNA vaccine can boost neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in individuals who have previously received two doses of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines, and (2) to assess the reactogenicity and safety of heterologous 3rd doses of vaccination. The specific primary objective of this study is to assess the vaccine (humoral) immunogenicity, proxy by SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing antibody titers, of a 3rd dose dose of mRNA vaccine (using BNT162b2, Fosun/BioNTech) at 28 days after the booster dose in individuals who have previously received two doses of any inactivated COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nStudy design: Open label trial in adults aged 30 years of age or older (at enrolment). The duration of participation for each participant will be 12 months from the administration of the 3rd vaccine dose. The immune response and reactogenicity of one dose of BNT162b2 will be investigated in individuals who previously received two doses of any inactivated COVID-19 vaccines at least 3 months earlier. Participants will be enrolled shortly before receiving the booster dose of BNT162b2 (day 0), with blood collection at days 0, 28, 182 and 365 days after enrolment for analysis of humoral immune responses.\n\nMain outcomes: The primary outcome is the vaccine immunogenicity measured as SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing antibodies in individuals who previously received two doses of any inactivated COVID-19 vaccines, evaluated as the geometric mean titer (GMT) at 28 days after the 3rd dose. The secondary outcomes include (1) a comparison of SARS- CoV-2 serum neutralizing antibodies as the geometric mean fold rise from baseline to each post-vaccination timepoint (i.e. at days 28, 182 and 365), and (2) descriptive analysis of the reactogenicity and safety profile of the 3rd dose.\n\nTarget population: Adults aged 30 years or older\n\nNumber of Subjects Planned: 300 participants to be recruited between September 2021 and December 2021\n\nStudy duration: 12 months for each participant\n\nPotential implications: This study will provide important evidence into the effects of using a 3rd dose of mRNA vaccines to boost the immune response in individuals that had previously received two doses of inactivated vaccines. This information together with data collected on reactogenicity and safety could inform COVID-19 vaccination policy locally and internationally.",

    "detailed_description": "Rare genetic diseases are a very heterogeneous group of diseases, often undiagnosed, for which patients receive only symptomatic treatment. The development of next-generation massive sequencing technology (Next-Generation-Sequencing; NGS) has made it possible to identify many of the genes responsible for these pathologies, allowing the pathogenic mechanisms to be outlined. The most commonly used methods, such as exome sequencing (Whole-Exome Sequencing; WES) or genome sequencing (Whole-Genome Sequencing; WGS), are based on DNA sequencing and allow to identify pathogenic mutations that cause loss of protein functionality, such as stop mutations, large insertions and deletions and the loss of canonical splicing sites. Conversely, the attribution of pathogenicity to an amino acid substitution variant (missense) or a synonymous variant is often questionable and, consequently, such variants are often categorized as Variants of Unknown Significance (VUS). Furthermore, exome sequencing is unable to identify possible pathogenic variants located in non-coding regions, such as non-canonical splice sites or deep intronic variants.\n\nWGS sequencing, while allowing the identification of variants present in the non-coding regions of a gene, is very expensive and produces an enormous amount of data with low pathogenic information. Algorithms to analyze the possible pathogenicity of intronic variants have little predictive power and the pathogenicity of the identified variants must be validated by lengthy and complex functional analyses. Due to these limitations, approximately 50% of patients with rare genetic diseases remain undiagnosed and cannot benefit from the benefits of personalized medicine. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) allows to determine variations in the sequence and levels of RNA, providing complementary information to that obtained with WES and WGS, thus improving the efficiency of genetic diagnosis. Splicing alterations, which are among the main causes of genetic diseases and can reside both in deep intronic regions and in coding regions, can be identified through RNA sequencing. Variants in the regulatory regions of the gene, which are able to influence RNA expression levels, can also be highlighted by RNA-Seq. Since RNA expression, in terms of levels and isoforms produced by alternative splicing, is tissue-specific, the most transcriptionally informative biological material is certainly the affected tissue. However, this is not always easy to achieve and the collection can be too invasive for the patient. In these cases it is possible to resort to the use of alternative tissues, such as whole blood or skin biopsies, which have low invasiveness and a broad RNA expression profile. Fibroblasts obtained from skin biopsies, in particular, have proven to be the most reliable, homogeneous and informative alternative matrix for RNA-Seq analysis, in a wide range of pathologies. It has been previously demonstrated that the information obtained from RNA-Seq from skin fibroblasts was superior to that obtained from blood. Furthermore, the analysis of the transcriptome of skin fibroblasts allowed to identify altered levels of transcripts and splicing abnormalities in neuromuscular and neurodevelopmental diseases. This confirmed the efficacy of the use of skin fibroblasts in the diagnosis of genetic pathologies in WES and WGS negative patients. Last but not least, skin fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into other cell types for possible future analyzes.\n\nThis project aims to identify, through RNA-Seq technology, the genetic alterations underlying undiagnosed rare diseases in pediatric and adult patients with early onset and with negative WES.\n\nAlthough NGS is essential for the diagnosis of genetic diseases, its success rates range from 30% to 50%. The advent of RNA-Seq increased the chance of diagnosing genetic diseases from 8% to 36%. Through this project the investigators intend to apply the RNA-Seq method, as an integration of the WES analysis, for the diagnosis of rare genetic diseases:\n\n* Objective 1: Set up and validate techniques. Set-up and validation of the transcriptome analysis protocol in healthy subjects and in patients with known splicing alterations and/or altered RNA expression.\n* Objective 2: Diagnostic phase. Study of splicing alterations and RNA levels in cultured fibroblasts obtained from skin biopsies of patients with rare genetic diseases and negative exome.\n\nExploratory goals.\n\n* To compare the RNA expression profile obtained from skin biopsy-derived fibroblasts with the RNA expression profile from blood.

Five healthy subjects will be recruited from the staff of the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research. To ensure the protection of the category of healthy volunteers, it has been envisaged that the enrollment is entrusted to the health personnel of the Dacc\u00f2 Center, who will inform, via email, all the staff of the Institute of the possibility of spontaneously joining the study. No manager or tutor will be involved in the recruitment of volunteers. As a further guarantee of confidentiality, for the purposes of the study, the samples of healthy volunteers will be treated in coded form The coded samples will be used to set up the method of isolation and culture of skin fibroblasts and RNA-Seq.\n\nValidation group. For the set-up and validation of the skin fibroblast isolation and RNA-Seq procedure, ten adult patients with known diagnosis and with alterations in RNA levels and/or splicing will be recruited as positive controls.\n\nAmong these, patients affected by atypical Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (aHUS), Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis (MPGN), Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney (ADPKD) or other rare pathologies previously diagnosed at the Dacc\u00f2 Center will be included, who have given their consent the collection and conservation (UNI EN ISO 9001 since 2016; certification n\u00b0 6121) of the samples in the certified biobank (Mario Negri Biological Resources Center - Rare and Kidney Diseases Biobank). Patients who meet the requirements described above will be contacted by the doctors of the Dacc\u00f2 Center for an interview explaining the project. Those who agree to participate in the study will be asked to sign the informed consent before proceeding with the experimental part.\n\n\"Discovery/Exploration\" group. The exploration cohort will be composed of 30 symptomatic undiagnosed patients with suspected genetic disease (children and adults with infantile onset) belonging to the Clinical Center of the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research and for whom WES investigations did not reveal causative genetic alterations. To this end the investigators plan to recruit about 60 patients, their parents and more informative family members, if available, who will be analyzed, if not done previously, by WES. Based on the literature and the investigators' experience, it is expected that WES analysis will be curative in 40-50% of cases. Therefore investigators assume to identify 30 patients with negative WES and who will therefore be able to enter the \"Discovery/Exploration\" cohort.\n\nAfter signing the informed consent to the collection and storage of samples (UNI EN ISO 9001 since 2016; certification n\u00b0 6121) in the certified biobank i.e., the Mario Negri Biological Resources Center - Rare and Renal Diseases Biobank, and after the collection of clinical information, patients will be enrolled in the project.\n\nBlood and skin biopsy samples for DNA and fibroblast isolation will be collected as described below.\n\nFor the WES analyses, 3 tubes of 3 ml of whole blood in EDTA will be taken from adults and 2 tubes of 3 ml of whole blood in EDTA from children and stored at -20\u00b0C until use. Blood collection will be done at the Mario Negri Institute-Dacc\u00f2 Center.\n\nThe WES analyzes will be performed at the Clinical Research Center for Rare Diseases \"Aldo e Cele Dacc\u00f2\" or in a specialized external laboratory, selected under our responsibility.\n\nAn additional 3 mL aliquot of whole blood will be drawn into TempusTM Blood RNA tubes, for exploratory analysis.\n\nA research biobank containing biological material in the form of blood, serum and plasma will be set up at the \"Mario Negri Biological Resource Center - Rare Diseases and Kidney Diseases Biobank\".\n\nAt the first visit, patients will sign a study-specific consent form, containing specific information and choices regarding participation in the research biobank, including the ability to use the samples in the future for additional research studies.\n\nIf subjects give their consent, aliquots of serum and plasma (1 x 2 ml of plasma, 1 x 2 ml of serum) will be collected and stored in coded form in the biobank.",

This study will investigate whether adding a treatment with phytonutrients found in cruciferous vegetables can improve the exercise response in older individuals.",
    "detailed_description": "Redox balance plays a key role in the age-associated increased risk for diseases. One reason for the lower resistance to oxidative stress with age is a gradual shift in the redox state toward a more oxidized cellular environment resulting in disruption of cell signaling. Nuclear erythroid factor 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is the master regulator of antioxidant defenses. Nrf2 drives expression of a host of genes involved in cytoprotection and antioxidant defenses. The Traustadottir lab was the first to demonstrate Nrf2 activation in response to acute exercise in humans, and in agreement with animal data, found an age-related impairment in exercise-induced Nrf2 signaling. This underscores an important problem related to aging, namely that older individuals are less sensitive to an exercise stimulus compared to younger cohorts. The focus of the proposed study is to try to solve this problem by amplifying the signal and mitigating the \"exercise desensitization\" exhibited by older individuals to restore redox balance. This study will test the hypothesis that combining acute exercise with sulforaphane will improve Nrf2 activation and downstream signaling in older adults compared to either alone. Sulforaphane (SFN) is a phytonutrient found in high concentrations in cruciferous vegetables and a potent Nrf2 activator. The hypothesis will be tested using two different approaches; the first experiment will use an in vivo-ex vivo approach, where peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from older men and women (\u226560y, n=30) pre- and post-acute exercise (in vivo) will be cultured and stimulated with SFN (ex vivo). This allows for a greater experimental control of the SFN stimulus. The second experiment will test the clinical translation applying the sulforaphane stimulus in vivo through an oral supplementation of sulforaphane in the form of whole broccoli sprout material, prior to acute exercise, in the same individuals. This second experiment will be a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over design. For all trials Nrf2 signaling will be measured by Nrf2 activation through an ARE binding assay, nuclear to whole cell ratio of Nrf2 protein, and Nrf2-dependent gene expression (HO-1, GCLC, NQO1, GR). Potential sex differences will be investigated. The insights gained from this study are whether combining simple interventions in the category of healthy lifestyle and preventive medicine can improve the adaptive response to exercise in older individuals. This could have an enormous impact by improving the health and well-being of older Americans.",

The study will be conducted to address its objectives in women living with HIV (from now on called HIV positive women); and 2) To evaluate the performance of other techniques for primary screening and as triage for HPV positives WLHIV.\n\n1,500 women living with HIV WLHIV will be recruited from HIV care clinics, also called antiretrovirals (ARV) clinics in South Africa. After giving informed consent, women will be screened with HPV testing and those that have a HPV positive test will be randomized at a 4:1 ratio into HPV + VIA + treat (Arm 1) and HPV + treat (Arm 2). Women in Arm 1 will receive VIA and only positive for VIA will be treated. In Arm 2, all HPV positive women will be treated. Women that are eligible for ablative treatment will be randomized into treatment with TA or cryotherapy in both arms. Others will be referred to colposcopy. After VIA in Arm 1 or before treatment in Arm 2, the nurses will collect 2-4 biopsies on all HPV positive women. The biopsies will be used as gold standard for disease detection. Treated women will be called by telephone after 1 week and 1 month to assess side-effects and satisfaction with the procedures. Cervical samples from women will be tested with HPV DNA test and HPV mRNA test to evaluate different screening tests for WLHIV. All women with a positive HPV test (treated or not) will be called back after 1 year for a follow-up visit. At this visit, women will be screened with HPV testing and VIA and 2-4 colposcopy-directed biopsies will be taken from all HPV positive women. Women with remaining/recurrent CIN2+ disease will receive appropriate management.",

MDD patients will be screened for the lifetime and recent occurrence of clinically meaningful suicidal ideation and behavior prior to recruitment (-T1). Moreover, in the MDD group, the emergence of clinically meaningful suicidal ideation and behavior will be evaluated at the baseline (T0) and after 4 weeks (T1) by means of the C-SSRS, accordingly to the routine clinical practice. Furtherly, to accomplish the pursues of this research, the two groups will undergo neuroimaging evaluation and a blood collection at the two timepoints for measuring the expression of ncRNA before and after treatment. Meanwhile, a lumbar puncture (LP) for CSF collection will be carried out at the baseline, measuring central levels of Negr-1 and other biomarkers of neurotropism potentially related to the aforementioned role of Negr1 in MDD. Group 3 will be comprehensive of 10 subjects without current or previous diagnosis of psychiatric disorders (healthy controls), who will be evaluated at baseline with psychometric and functional scales, neuroimaging and blood samples collection for ncRNA. Data obtained by the multimodal assessment of HCs at the baseline will be employed as normalization features in the statistical analysis of patients' data.",
    "detailed_description": "In this clinical trial, the investigators will recruit a cohort consisting of 10 patients with MDD who will be evaluated at baseline (T0) and at 4 weeks from the setting of drug treatment with venlafaxine (T1). The sample consists of patients already being treated with antidepressant drugs (e.g., drugs SSRI/SNRIs) for whom it was necessary to switch to venlafaxine therapy medication due to poor/no response or poor tolerability to current therapy according to the indications of the major clinical guidelines for the treatment of MDD and completely independently of study participation.\n\nTo distinguish clinical variations related to the clinical course of depression, the investigators will also recruit a cohort of 10 patients with bipolar disorder, suffering from a current depressive episode (Group 2) and who will be assessed both at T0 and after 4 weeks (T1). To identify markers blood and neuroimaging markers of MDD, will be recruited 10 healthy controls without current psychiatric history (Group 3), who will be evaluated only at baseline (T0). After signing informed consent and recruitment, demographic data (age, sex, level of education, etc.) and clinical data (past and current diagnoses, comorbidities, habits smoking, past therapy, age at onset, etc.) were collected from patients and healthy controls, as possible variables confounders to the clinical course of MDD. Patients with MDD and bipolar disorder will be tested with psychometric and functional scales (BPRS, MADRS, HDRS, GAF) at baseline (T0) and after 4 weeks of therapy (T1), to assess the change in clinical picture.\n\nThe presence or occurrence of suicidal ideation or behavior in patients with MDD will be assessed by clinical interview and administration of the C-SSRS at baseline (T0) and after 4 weeks of therapy (T1). (In addition, the three groups at baseline will perform structural and functional brain MRI associated with EEG and the collection of two peripheral venous blood samples. All assessments will be repeated at T1 (at 4 weeks) for Groups 1 and 2 of MDD and DB patients. More over, at baseline, patients in Group 1 and 2 will undergo spinal tap (PL), with collection of a sample of fluid cerebrospinal fluid, for measurement of central levels of Negr-1 and other biomarkers of neurotropism potentially involved in Negr1 activity in MDD. In the cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood biological samples, obtained from the three groups of subjects, the levels of gene expression (mRNA) and protein levels of Negr-1 and other biomarkers involved in the modulation of the antidepressant response operated by Negr-1, will be assessed by digital droplets PCR (ddPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression levels of the following genes involved in the NEGR-1 pathway will be tested in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells. The genes include Abeta 1-42, tau, P-tau, MAPT, MAP2, GAP43, NCAM, SYP, VEGF, IGF-1, BDNF and FGF-2. Their expression levels will be tested in the CSF by Droplet Digital PCR (QX200 ddPCR BioRad), using Taqman Probes. Several housekeeping genes will be used for normalization. Biological samples will be processed by the laboratory of neurodegenerative and demyelinating diseases of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico. Neuroimaging scans will be collected from MDD patients, BD patients and healthy controls at T0, and for MDD and BD patients at T1. The scans of neuroimaging will be performed using a 3-Tesla Philips Achieva MRI scanner and with an MRI-compatible EEG system). The investigators will collect data resting-state, at baseline and after 4 weeks of follow-up. The administration of drug therapy with venlafaxine (IMP of study) in MDD patients will be done according to normal clinical practice, following the indications in the CPR, the package insert and following medical prescription based on the clinical evaluation. The intervention study is related to the extra standard of care MRI that the MDD and BD patients will perform at baseline and after 4 weeks and to the cerebrospinal fluid collection (an invasive procedure not included in clinical practice for the management of these patients).",

    "brief_summary": "Beyond pulmonary complications, COPD presents with extrapulmonary manifestations including reduced cognitive, cardiovascular, and muscle function. While exercise training is the cornerstone in the non-pharmacological treatment of COPD, there is a need for new exercise training methods.\n\nThe COPD-HIIT trial intend to investigate the effects and mechanisms of 12 weeks supramaximal high-intensity interval-training (HIIT) compared to moderate intensive continous training (MICT) in people with COPD and matched healthy controls on important clinical outcomes.\n\nThe trial also intends to compare the effects of 24 months of exercise training (supramaximal HIIT or MICT) to usual care in people with COPD on brain health, cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle power; in people with COPD.",
    "detailed_description": "COPD-HIIT is a prospective, multi-centre, randomised, controlled, parallel-group superiority trial with assessor and data analyst blinding, featuring a 1:1 allocation ratio and two separate phases. In Phase 1, the trial will investigate the effects and mechanisms of a 12 week intervention with supramaximal HIIT compared to MICT in people with COPD and matched healthy controls. Upon completing the initial 12 week intervention and follow-up assessments, people with COPD, but not healthy controls, will enter Phase 2 of the trial. Phase 2 comprises a 21 month maintenance exercise program. Subsequently, exercise training (supramaximal HIIT or MICT) will be performed until a 24 month follow-up. A separate control group of people with COPD, receiving usual care only, will undergo assessments at baseline and 24-months, making Phase 2 a partially randomized controlled trial.\n\nThe primary objectives are:\n\n1. to determine and compare the effect of 12-weeks of supramaximal HIIT and MICT on cognitive function, cardiorespiratory fitness, and muscle power in people with COPD compared to matched healthy controls (Phase 1).\n2. to determine and compare the effect of 24-months of supramaximal HIIT, MICT and usual care on cognitive function, cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle power in people with COPD (Phase 2).\n\nPhase 1 and 2 of the COPD-HIIT project will be performed at two recruiting centres. 1) Department of Community Medicine and Rehabilitation, Physiotherapy, Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden and Norrlands Universitetssjukhus, and 2) Faculty of Rehabilitation Sciences, Hasselt University, Diepenbeek, Belgium and Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg (ZOL, Genk, Belgium).\n\nIn Phase 1, eligible participants will be randomized to either supramaximal HIIT (intervention arm) or MICT (active control arm) on a stationary bicycle (Smart ZBike, Zycle, Valencia, Spain). For both arms, training is performed two to three times per week for a total of 30 sessions (Table 1) using a group format with groups of 4-8 participants at the same time. Both protocols enable controlled and systematic adjustments of training intensity by means of standardized criteria to achieve a progressive overload\n\nRegarding supramaximal HIIT, importantly, while the intensity is supramaximal, it is dosed and performed at a given fraction of the maximum capacity that the person can produce during the bout (6-seconds). In contrast to an all-out regimen, or sprint interval training (SIT), this allows for the introduction and titration of intensity to the highest acceptable level without the individual feeling unwell during the process.\n\nIn Phase 2, participants with COPD will enter a 21 month maintenance phase. They will continue to exercise using the same training modality (HIIT or MICT) as during the first 12-weeks but can select between three different settings to continue their training: \"Home\", \"Outpatient\", or \"Mix\" setting. Notably, the participant can, at any time during the maintenance period, change between the \"Home\", \"Outpatient\" or \"Mix\" settings when conducting their endurance training. Irrespective of the originally assigned group (supramaximal HIIT or MICT) or if the participant selects to continue in \"Home\", \"Outpatient\" or \"Mix\" setting, they will also perform a resistance training (RT) regime. The RT regime will consist of ten lower and upper-body exercises designed following American College of Sports Medicine guidelines and other relevant RT literature for increasing muscular strength, endurance, and power.\n\nAll exercise sessions will be held and supervised by an experienced health care professional, such as physiotherapists, exercise physiologists or other health professional with equivalent expertise. All intervention providers will receive training on exercise intervention protocols to ensure standardization among centres.\n\nThe between-group effects will be analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). In the ANCOVA, baseline values, age, sex, center and VO2peak will be used as covariates. There will be one model for the COPD group and one for HC. To investigate any differential effects to the interventions between COPD and HC, an additional model including the Group (COPD/HC) \u00d7 Intervention (HIIT/MICT) will be performed. Furthermore, pre-specified longitudinal mediation analyses will be performed on the entire MRI and PET/CT sample between changes in VO2peak, neurodegenerative measures, e.g., cognitive function and hippocampal volume, and inflammation levels between baseline and 24 months.\n\nAnalyses will employ the intention-to-treat when applicable. Meaning that all participants randomized, whether they receive their allocated intervention or withdrew from the trial, will be included in the analysis. The primary analyses are performed using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) for missing data. The imputation will be done separately for each intervention arm. In addition, a per-protocol analysis (defined as \\> 75% attendance rate as well as no exacerbations during the last two weeks prior to follow-up assessment), and a complete-case analysis (including participants with complete outcome measurements independent on attendance rate) will be reported.\n\nThe full study protocol adheres to the SPIRIT guidelines and its outcomes extension, with intervention descriptions further guided by the TIDieR checklist the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template (CERT). Publications from COPD-HIIT will follow the CONSORT statement, or relevant guidelines at the time of publication. Publications including qualitative outcomes will also be guided by the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ).",

Therefore, this project will fill this gap by performing a single-blind, placebo-controlled trial in humans with hypertension.",
    "detailed_description": "The endoplasmic reticulum is a multipurpose organelle found in most human cells, including those in the brain and the endothelium of blood vessels. One of the primary functions of the endoplasmic reticulum is the posttranslational folding of new proteins and the reprocessing of misfolded or damaged proteins. Physiological and pathophysiological conditions can lead to the accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins, thus triggering the unfolded protein response which is a quality control system that maintains endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis. However, with prolonged or severe exposure to endoplasmic reticulum stress inducers, the unfolded protein response can augment the formation of reactive oxygen species, inflammatory mediators, and transcription factors that trigger sympathetic overactivity and induce endothelial dysfunction. There is strong evidence suggesting that endoplasmic reticulum stress contributes to neurogenic and vascular hypertension in various animal models, however this has never been explored in humans. This proposal builds on prior work in which the investigators pharmacologically augmented circulating concentrations of the potent endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) and the development of an assay/test to quantify endoplasmic reticulum stress in cutaneous biopsy samples.\n\nThis study will accomplish the following Specific Aims:\n\n1. Examine if endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibition, via chronic ingestion of tauroursodeoxycholic acid, will attenuate 24h blood pressure in humans with elevated (120-129/\\<80 mmHg) or stage 1 (130-140/80-90 mmHg) hypertension.\n2. Examine the extent to which endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibition alters neurovascular control in the participants of Aim 1. Independent of the contribution to blood pressure regulation, neurovascular function is considered a key risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. As such, the outcome of Aim 2, while providing mechanistic insight into the blood pressure lowering effect of endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibition, should be considered independent of the outcomes of Aim 1.",

Participants will be randomized (like the toss of a coin) to receive the experimental vaccine or a placebo (a look-alike solution that contains no vaccine).\n\nTo be in the study participants will have to have already had three doses of a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) COVID vaccine and be generally healthy. Participants are given a single dose of the vaccine by breathing in a fine mist that goes directly into the lungs.\n\nDuring follow-up participants will:\n\n* visit the clinic for checkups and blood tests at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after vaccination\n* report their symptoms for 24 weeks after getting the vaccine.\n\nIn some participants, the researchers will collect cells from the lung 4 weeks after vaccination (a test known as a bronchoscopy).",
    "detailed_description": "The global impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains profound; COVID-19 continues to be one of the leading causes of death and hospitalization due to infectious disease, disproportionately affecting the elderly and immunocompromised. The continuous evolution of the virus has significantly challenged the effectiveness of first-generation and updated vaccination strategies. These variants of concern (VOCs) can evade neutralizing antibodies.\n\nAdequate and early lung mucosal immunity is critical for control of infection but current vaccines fail to induce robust mucosal immunity in the lungs, a major reason for the high rates of break-through infections. The respiratory mucosal route of immunization, however, can induce protective respiratory mucosal immunity consisting of trained innate immunity (via memory airway macrophages), mucosal antibodies, and tissue-resident memory CD4+/CD8+ T cells.\n\nA phase 1 study has been completed using a recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd) vector, ChAd-CoV3/Mac in 23 healthy volunteers and has shown that the vaccine can be safely administered by aerosol and that immune responses against COVID-19 develop in the lung and T-cells and neutralizing antibodies are generated in the blood.\n\nThe purpose of this placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial is to determine if this new COVID-19 vaccine, ChAd-triCoV/Mac, is safe to give by aerosol to people who have been vaccinated with at least three doses of a COVID mRNA vaccine and evaluate the immune responses generated. Specifically, the researchers want to see if T cell responses and antibody responses to the COVID virus proteins develop in the blood after receiving the vaccine.\n\nThere is a lack of surrogate immune markers for vaccine-induced protection against antibody-evading VOCs of SARS-CoV-2. However, given the now recognized importance of respiratory mucosal T cell immunity in anti-SARS-CoV-2 host defense, this study will allow for a correlation of mucosal T cell immunity with the T cells in blood to help predict vaccine efficacy, and inform the design of phase 3 efficacy studies.",

    "detailed_description": "In the rapidly evolving treatment landscape of advanced solid tumors, immunotherapeutic approaches have revolutionized cancer care for patients. Despite these advances, there is an undiminished need for the development of novel immunotherapeutic treatment modalities that are able to orchestrate effective anti-tumor immune responses. The investigators study a new class of immunomodulatory nanomedicines: PLGA nanoparticles loaded with a tumor antigen and an iNKT cell agonist.\n\nPLGA is a biodegradable polymer with minimal (systemic) toxicity, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to be used in various drug-carrying platforms.Tumor antigens and immunomodulatory molecules can be co-encapsulated in PLGA-based nanoparticles. In preclinical studies, these PLGA-based nanoparticles can induce anti-tumor immune responses. The investigators aim to explore PLGA-based nanoparticles containing the tumor antigen NY-ESO-1 and the iNKT cell activator IMM60 for their capacity to induce anti-tumor responses in cancer patients.\n\nNY-ESO-1 is a cancer-testis antigen normally expressed in testicular germ cells and trophoblasts of the placenta. However, NY-ESO-1 is also expressed in a wide range of cancers with a high incidence (around 25-30% of several \\[advanced\\] cancers, such as melanoma \\[40%\\], lung \\[2-32%\\], bladder \\[32-35%\\], and ovarian \\[30%\\] cancer). NY-ESO-1 is able to elicit immune responses. Patients who have NY-ESO-1-positive tumors have spontaneous or vaccine-induced humoral and cellular immune responses against this antigen. Therefore, NY-ESO-1 is considered to be a suitable tumor antigen for further clinical evaluation. Clinical trials have already shown the safety and tolerability of the NY-ESO-1 protein and peptides in patients with advanced cancer.\n\nIn order to generate NY-ESO-1-directed immune responses, the NY-ESO-1 protein is taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and processed in small protein fragments, peptides. Particular peptides can bind to patient-specific HLA molecules and, subsequently, this HLA-peptide complex is recognized at the cell membrane by the T cell receptor (TCR) of T cells. Once the TCR specifically binds to the HLA-peptide complex, the T cell becomes stimulated and exerts its function, i.e. tumor cell killing by CD8+ T cells. In 1, an overview of the peptides known to bind to certain HLA alleles and recognized by T cells, either by CD4+ or by CD8+ T cells, is presented.\n\nParticulate vaccines are known to elicit better immune responses due to higher uptake by APCs. Encapsulating antigens and adjuvants within the same polymeric nanoparticle can enhance T cell responses. In earlier studies, the NY-ESO-1 whole protein was encapsulated in adjuvant ISCOMATRIX and shown to induce specific T cell responses in a majority of patients. iNKT cell agonists are more suitable adjuvants due to their higher activity in low doses and activation of DCs by iNKT cells. In this respect, the investigators will employ PLGA nanoparticles loaded with the NY-ESO-1 antigen and the iNKT cell agonist IMM60 as a co-delivery system.\n\nTo facilitate NY-ESO-1 antigen encapsulation, long (85-111(peptide #2) and 117-143(peptide #3)) and short (157-165(peptide #4)) peptides will be incorporated into nanoparticles. In combination, the three selected NY-ESO-1-derived peptides are presented in 80% of the class I and class II HLA alleles of the European population. Similar peptides (79-116 and 118-143) were previously loaded onto DCs together with \u03b1-GalCer and delivered to cancer patients in a recent clinical trial. The results of that trial demonstrated iNKT cell expansion, CD4+ T cell responses against the 118-143 peptide in 7/8 patients, and CD8+ T cell responses against the 79-116 peptide in 3/8 patients (Gasser, Sharples et al. 2018). Here, an additional short peptide (157-165) is included, which is presented by the highly prevalent HLA-A2.1 molecule. Hence, higher CD8+ T cell responses against this epitope and superior activation of human iNKT cells by IMM60 are expected due to co-encapsulation.",

    "brief_summary": "The goals of our research project are to identify factors explaining inter-individual variation in responses to resistance training (RT) and the baseline determinants underlying an individual's sensitivity to respond to RT. Moreover, investigators aim to assess whether a responsiveness to RT predicts responsiveness to endurance training (ET). Thus, investigators aim to gain a deeper understanding of exercise adaptation processes. The main questions investigators aim to answer are:\n\n* Can the physiological responses of one RT intervention be extrapolated to a subsequent RT intervention?\n* If so, what are the mechanisms underlying differing skeletal muscle growth responses in low, and high responders of skeletal muscle hypertrophy?\n* If so, do the low responders of skeletal muscle growth respond more favourably when the amount of RT is increased?\n* Are the high, moderate, and low responders of RT also the highest, moderate, and lowest responders to ET?\n\nTo examine these main research questions, high (n=30), low (n=30), and moderate (n=30) responders of skeletal muscle growth in response to RT (intervention I, NCT05874986) are reallocated into a subsequent 12-week RT intervention (intervention II) after a detraining period. A subgroup of these participants (n=10) will engage in a 6-week control period before starting the second RT period. Additionally, after intervention II, participants will participate in an ET intervention, lasting 6 weeks.\n\nIn this intervention II, reallocated participants will be:\n\n* Resistance training with supervision for 12 weeks\n* Consuming deuterium oxide for the assessment of muscle protein synthesis\n* Consuming D3-3-methylhistidine for the assessment of acute muscle protein breakdown\n* Consuming D3-creatine for the examination of whole-body skeletal muscle mass\n* Providing a spot urine sample six (6) times, and urine collection for 24 hours performed twice\n* Providing saliva samples (30-32 in total) for the assessment of body water enrichment of deuterium\n* Providing a muscle biopsy four or five (4-5) times during the study\n* Providing a blood sample fourteen (14) times during the study\n* Assessed for body composition and body volume four or five times (4-5) during the study\n* Participating in muscle size, maximal dynamic strength and TMS measurements four or five (4-5) times during the study\n* Asked to answer questionnaires related to e.g. stress, physical activity, sleep, perceived exertion, and diet\n* Participating in recovery measurements before and after the second-to-last and the last RT bout, and once in the days between these RT bouts, consisting of six (6) body volume measurements and six (6) maximal voluntary isometric contraction (kg) tests using horizontal leg press for the assessment of neuromuscular recovery\n* Participating in an acute resistance exercise (RE) after the 12-week RT intervention.\n\nFurthermore, in the ET intervention, participants will be:\n\n* Participating in a familiarization session and resting electrocardiograph measurements before the intervention\n* Participating in endurance testing consisting of body composition, movement economy, and incremental RAMP testing before and after ET intervention\n* Endurance training with supervision for 6 weeks, three times a week.",
    "detailed_description": "While the diverse health and performance benefits of resistance training (RT) are widely recognized, some individuals demonstrate notably divergent responses to RT intervention. This phenomenon is termed inter-individual response variation to RT. However, despite the prevalence of these research findings, the precise underlying mechanisms contributing to these differential RT responses remain ambiguous. Finally, it is currently unknown whether a responsiveness to RT predicts responsiveness to ET within the same set of participants, as this area of research is critically understudied.\n\nInvestigators aim to investigate the cellular, molecular, and neuromuscular mechanisms behind the plausible RT response variability intra- and inter-individually, using trial-to-trial, i.e. resistance training, detraining, and retraining design. Moreover, as the impact of diverse polygenic effects on RT responsiveness is yet to be determined, investigators will employ a multi-OMIC (genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) approach to unravel previously unknown denominators of RT responsiveness. Finally, numerous environmental factors, e.g. nutrition, stress, sleep, and physical activity are monitored during the study to assess the effects of non-physiological mechanisms on RT response variability.\n\nIn our study, 362 healthy male and female participants in total started in the study and were destined to undergo an RT period of 12 weeks in two separate periods (intervention I refers to NCT05874986). Then, a subset of the participants from intervention I will be reallocated into intervention II based on the magnitude increase of m. vastus lateralis (VL) cross-sectional area (CSA) assessed by ultrasound using extended-field-of-view mode. Similar to intervention I, intervention II will be performed in separate periods similarly to the data collection I and II of intervention I to first accumulate approximately 32 weeks of detraining for both cohorts, after which 12 weeks of RT is performed.\n\nMoreover, a subset (n=30) of the participants aged 40-50 from intervention I not selected for intervention II have a chance to take part in a 10-week home training sub-study. These participants will be randomized to a non-training control group (n=15) and a home training group (n=15). The home training group will carry out a 10-week RT period utilizing muscle-strengthening activities in their home. This sub-study investigates how minimally supervised RT executed at home after supervised gym RT can maintain muscle strength and size compared to non-training. Home training is flexible, time-saving, and inexpensive. It is also done twice weekly using safe and effective training protocols and movements. Home-based training includes pistol squat, reverse nordic, push up, and bent-over row, and bicep curl exercises. To achieve progression, the total load will be increased by increasing the number of repetitions per set, and/or increasing the load by using a progression from easier to more difficult techniques and/or by adding resistance bands, which will be provided to participant's free of charge for the duration of the study. Participants will be contacted regularly to ensure motivation and adherence to home exercise. All the participants in this sub-study, as well as the other participants not selected for intervention II are offered a self-directed, non-supervised 7-week RT period with a similar design as in intervention I with access to our gym located in our Faculty's building. VL CSA, horizontal leg press 1 repetition maximum, and body composition will be assessed before and after home training and self-directed RT for each participant.\n\nIn intervention II, participants will be performing RT similarly to intervention I. However, for the last 5 weeks of the intervention, RT volume will be increased by 40 % for the lower body exercises to assess the impact of RT volume increment on RT responses. After 12 weeks of RT, an experimental RT session will be conducted to assess the acute physiological responses to resistance exercise. The experimental session will consist of five heavy sets of both horizontal leg press and leg extension exercises. During the last RT week, participants will engage in recovery measurements before and after the second-to-last and the last RT bout, and once during the days between these two bouts. After 12 weeks of RT, participants will be performing an additional acute resistance exercise session. All the participants NOT selected for intervention II are able to participate in a self-directed, 6-week RT period with measurements before and after this period. These measurements include body composition, muscle size (VL CSA and muscle thickness of elbow flexors) and muscle strength (dynamic 1RM of horizontal leg press and barbell scott curl) assessments. A subgroup of the participants (n=10) will engage in a control period of 6 weeks in duration, before the onset of RT.\n\nAfter the intervention II, participants will begin a washout period lasting approximately 16 weeks (\u00b1 2), during which participants are advised to abstain from RT and ET. After a washout period, participants will participate in the familiarization measurements regarding the ET intervention. In familiarization, participants are measured with an electrocardiogram (ECG), after which a medical doctor will evaluate the resting ECG results to verify the eligibility of each participant. Moreover, participants will be habituated to movement economy testing by performing 3x3 min low-intervals with loads of 30-55-80 watts for females and 50-80-110 watts for males, respectively, and other included measurements. After familiarization and eligibility assessment, baseline measurements will be conducted the following week. Baseline measurements include body composition and volume assessment with a 3D optical body scanner, a 4 x 4 minute movement economy test with individualized, progressive loads determined in the familiarization (last load near the aerobic threshold). Movement economy intervals are performed with no rest in between. Finally, a maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) will be measured breath-by-breath with an incremental RAMP test. The starting intensity will be 30 watts for both males and females, and the intensity will be increased by 30 and 25 watts per minute for males and females, respectively. The RAMP test will be performed with a self-selected cadence above 60 rounds per minute (rpm). When participants fail to maintain a cadence over 60 rpm second time, after one warning and despite heavy encouragement, the RAMP test will be terminated. All the testing will be performed using a bicycle ergometer. Heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), expired gas analysis, arterial oxygen saturation, power output, stroke volume and cardiac output will be monitored continuously during the tests. Perceived exertion is assessed with a modified RPE scale of 0-10 after each movement economy interval and RAMP test. Blood lactate, blood glucose and hemoglobin concentrations are also measured after each movement economy interval and at the end of the RAMP test.\n\nEndurance exercise is programmed based on the guidelines by the American College of Sports Medicine. During weeks 1-2, 45 minutes of low-intensity (= near the first ventilatory threshold) steady-state cycling is performed. In weeks 3-4, 50 minutes of cycling is performed, during which every other session includes low intensity cycling and every other session 3 x 10-minute intervals (with 4-minute rest after each interval) at moderate intensity (= between the first and the second ventilatory thresholds). Finally, in weeks 5-6, 55 minutes of cycling is performed, consisting of 4 x 10-minute intervals (with 3-minute rest after each interval) at a moderate intensity. Participants will be doing endurance exercises in groups of 2-4, and training three times a week at the standardized time of day. At the beginning of ET, appropriate training intensities are verified with blood lactate and the modified RPE scale. Training intensities at the start are decided by two blinded researchers based on the ventilatory thresholds obtained during the RAMP test. Individual training data, including heart rate, HRV, RPE, and wattage, is collected. The wattage is continuously displayed on the screen of the cycle ergometers during sessions to maintain appropriate training intensities. Wattage is increased within and between training sessions according to heart rate, lactate concentration, and modified RPE scale to establish progression. Before the onset of each interval session, a brief low-intensity steady-state warm-up of 7-8 minutes is performed.\n\nIn this study, investigators aim to identify several previously unknown molecular determinants that underlie the observed heterogeneity in RT responses. This could significantly increase the understanding of exercise physiology, which can be applied, e.g., in sports medicine, rehabilitation, and sports coaching. Moreover, this study can promote the development of personalized exercise prescriptions as part of health care. Indeed, it is vital to examine whether the same individuals respond similarly or differently to RT and ET at least in the short term. These findings can then be used to adjust individualized training programming not only as a part of health care but also regarding physical performance optimization. Finally, the findings of the study can operate as a foundational work for future research on the topic of RT response heterogeneity.",

    "detailed_description": "Indicators of longevity in humans include skeletal muscle mass and strength. Muscle mass depends on the balance between myofibrillar protein synthesis and degradation, influenced by diet and physical activity. Muscle strength correlates with muscle mass, and weight lifting until failure increases muscle protein synthesis, enhancing muscle mass and strength over time. Protein intake is crucial for positive protein balance and muscle growth. Animal proteins promote muscle synthesis more effectively than plant proteins. Limited research exists on the impact of agricultural practices on meat quality. Studies indicate that organic meat may have higher nutritional value and better lipid profiles.

Although equally effective (acupuncture and metformin), the investigators hypothesize that acupuncture is associated with less negative side-effects. The investigators also hypothesize that these treatments have the potential to restore epigenetic and molecular alterations in target tissues (endometrial-, adipose-, and skeletal muscle tissue) and thus have the potential to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D).",

To determine the clinical effectiveness of 4 months of 1) electroacupuncture + lifestyle management and 2) metformin + lifestyle management, compared to 3) lifestyle management only, for improvement of insulin sensitivity as measured by HOMA-IR, by the insulin response to glucose assessed by calculating the area under the curve (AUCinsulin) during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and by glucose regulation (assessed by analyzing Hba1c levels).\n\nSecondary aims\n\n1. To evaluate changes in secondary metabolic measures, including fasting insulin, c-peptide, glucose, and adipokines, calculation of HOMA-B (i.e. the Islet \u03b2-cell function) and the c-peptide index, assessment of the adipokines and lipid profile, body size and proportions and body fat distribution.\n2. To determine changes in genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation profiles related to insulin sensitivity in fat, muscle and endometrial tissue biopsies, and biomarkers in whole blood.\n3. To evaluate endocrine measures including menstrual pattern and ovulation frequency, circulating hormones (sex steroids, AMH, gonadotropins), and excretion of metabolites of sex steroids in urine.\n4. To determine changes in women's HRQoL, symptoms of anxiety and depression, dieting and eating patterns, and negative side-effects.\n5.

    "brief_summary": "Major depressive disorder is the leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting up to 300 million people each year, and one in five people will experience depression at least once in their lives. Emotional bias is an essential component of characterized depressive episodes, leading depressed patients to attribute a more negative valence to emotional stimuli.\n\nOn the basis of recent and robust neuroscientific data revisiting the role of the cerebral amygdala as an essential essential structure for encoding the negative and positive valences and of emotional stimuli, the team has shown in mice that a depressive phenotype induced by a chronic administration of corticosterone, a well-known model of depression, is associated with a change in hedonic value allocation, i.e. pleasant odors become less pleasant, and aversive odors become even more unpleasant, mimicking what happens in humans (identical data in humans).\n\nIt assumes that:\n\n1. There is a negative emotional bias in depressed patients compared with control subjects, evidenced by the assignment of more negative valences when viewing images.\n2. In depressed subjects, compared with controls subjects, there is greater activation of the basolateral amygdala/ventral hippocampus pathway (the level of imaging resolution of imaging does not allow to study the basolateral amygdala/central amygdala pathway in humans) and less of the basolateral amygdala/nucleus accumbens pathway.\n3. In depressed subjects, improvement in negative emotional bias correlated with a good response after after 4 weeks of treatment with esketamine (Spravato) measured by a 50% reduction in the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale.\n4. In depressed patients, early improvement of emotional bias (after a single administration) is predictive of response to treatment at 4 weeks.\n5. In depressed patients with a good response to a single 4-weeks course of esketamine (Spravato), a normalization of activation of basolateral amygdala/ventral hippocampus and basolateral amygdala/nucleus accumbens pathways is observed.\n6. Depressed subjects have different immunoinflammatory and RNA editing patterns different from control subjects.\n7. In depressed patients, clinical improvement correlates with normalization of patients; inflammatory profile and certain mRNA editing\n8. Some clinical features of major depressive disorder are associated with greater negative emotional bias significant",

    "detailed_description": "Parental history of diabetes confers substantial individual risk for development of obesity and diabetes. Obesity risk can be transmitted across generations, from parents or grandparents to children. Genomic variation explains only a portion of this risk. Epigenetic modulation through DNA methylation, histone modification, or by noncoding RNAs, provide mechanisms to regulate gene activity independent of DNA sequence by determining which genes are turned on or off in response to environment or disease. Epigenetic changes can be stable over the lifespan providing a mechanism through which environmental exposures may impart long-term effects on gene expression and phenotypic outcome.\n\nThe maternal intrauterine environment is now well recognized to modify obesity and T2D disease risk of offspring. Fetuses carried by women who are obese, have diabetes, or suffer from suboptimal nutrition are at increased risk of insulin resistance, obesity, T2D, and cardiovascular disease risk as adults. Studies in rodents also show that the health, metabolism, and prior environmental exposures of the male can also influence health of his offspring. Existing data provide powerful support for the hypothesis that current glucose levels and overall metabolic health of males can alter epigenetic marks in sperm and suggest a novel modifiable mechanism of transmission. However, much less is known about how human sperm epigenetic patterns change with nutritional and metabolic health, and whether these may ultimately impart differences in health of future generations. Thus, we are studying the impact of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and elevations in glucose common to both conditions, on human reproductive health and the sperm epigenome.",

    "detailed_description": "Nephropathy is a progressive complication of DKD and NDKD and substantially increases morbidity and mortality. Clinicians frequently measure proteinuria using urine protein /creatinine and urine albumin/creatinine ratios, which in several instances do not manifest substantial improvement, even after an intervention such as SGLT2i, particularly if the intervention period is is less than 6 months. There is therefore a clear need for other markers of podocyte injury in early phases of chronic kidney disease.\n\nBased on published studies, podocyte-specific injury proteins such as podocalyxin, Nephrin and Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) can be candidate marker proteins of injury. Urinary exosome analysis is a non-invasive and potentially more sensitive assay. These sensitive markers would reduce the need for biopsies to detect podocytopathy.\n\nThe Veterans Health Administration has been a prominent caregiver to the African American community across the United States. Over the past decade, investigators have established the basic population genetics and epidemiology of APOL1-associated kidney disease and are making progress in understanding disease mechanisms at the cellular and molecular levels. With therapeutic approaches for APOL1 kidney disease now being explored by many groups in pharma and academia, studies to assess the relationship of APOL1 gene expression levels with podocyte injury in CKD are of paramount importance and will better inform treatment in the near future. These studies may address one important cause of the significant racial disparity in CKD rates among African-Americans. This study aim to explore mechanistic insights gained from the effect of SGLT2i on podocyte injury markers further in the backdrop of APOL1 expression, to understand the potential therapeutic impact SGLT2i may have in this clinical context.\n\nAs APOL-1 gene mutation is much more common in African Americans and approximately 80% of VA population is African Americans, this study has been decided to enroll only from African American race in order to keep the population homogenous and achieve statistically significant results. Though the study will only include African Americans the study will be quite relevant in USA as worsening CKD is a major health problem in this country and the African American patient population is at particularly at a high risk for progressive CKD. A largely under-recognized public health issue, CKD is the ninth leading cause of death in the U.S. today. Although African Americans constitute 13% of the population, they suffer more than triple the rate of kidney failure of Caucasians.",

It is caused by pathogenic bacteria of the Leptospira species of the spirochete family. It is estimated that there are over a million cases of leptospirosis worldwide each year, with 60,000 deaths. These figures place leptospirosis among the most dangerous bacterial zoonoses in the world.\n\nThe disease affects the most disadvantaged populations, and also inflicts its burden on domestic and farm animals. To this day, however, leptospirosis remains a neglected disease, poorly understood because it has been little studied.\n\nHuman leptospirosis initially presents as a febrile syndrome, with fever, headache, myalgia and joint pain. These symptoms are very similar to those observed in influenza, dengue fever and other acute febrile illnesses, making diagnosis very difficult.\n\nDelayed initiation of antibiotic therapy, a treatment recommended by the WHO, is associated with the development of severe forms of leptospirosis. Indeed, in 10% of cases, leptospirosis evolves into severe forms, which are still poorly described, but which result in haemorrhage, multivisceral failure (lungs, kidneys, liver) and a drastic increase in the case-fatality rate. In 2023, 152 cases of leptospirosis were reported in New Caledonia. Of these, 130 people (85%) were hospitalized and 4 deaths were recorded (2.6%).\n\nFor patients suffering from leptospirosis, it is therefore important to be able to make the diagnosis quickly, ideally as soon as symptoms appear. It is also crucial to be able to monitor, or even prevent, the development of severe forms of the disease, to ensure optimal patient care.",

To achieve this goal, Individuals coming to the emergency department of the Centre Hospitalier Territorial de Nouvelle-Cal\u00e9donie will be recruited either with suspected leptospirosis with signs and symptoms or healthy showing no infectious signs.\n\nFor febrile patients with confirmed (group 1) or refuted (group 2) diagnosis of leptospirosis:\n\n* At D0: a 20-ml blood sample and a 5-ml urine sample\n* At D1, D3 and D15: a 20-ml blood sample\n\nFor healthy patients (group 3):\n\n* At D0: a 20-ml blood sample and a 5-ml urine sample\n* At D15: a 20-ml blood sample.\n\nThe analyses to be carried out are :\n\n* Host-pathogen sequencing,\n* Metagenomics,\n* Transcriptomics,\n* Metabolomics,\n* And cytokine assays to study the host immune response.",

During the last decades, a therapeutic challenge was to overcome the tumor's resistance to endocrine therapy (ET). Thanks to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of this resistance, effective new treatments have been developed, such as Kisqali\u00ae (ribociclib), a molecularly targeted therapy. This treatment blocks the growth and division of cancer cells by blocking proteins called CDK4/6 located inside the cell. This treatment, taken in combination with ET, blocks the harmful effect of hormones (estrogen) on cancer cell proliferation, and represent the standard first-line treatment of patients with HR+/HER2- mBC.\n\nBut, as with any treatment, it is expected that some patients will have a good response and their disease will be stabilized or even in remission, while other patients will not benefit from treatment and will relapse. In order to make progress, it is necessary to identify pre-therapeutic markers predictive of response to this treatment and the molecular mechanisms of this resistance set up by the tumor before or under the effect of the treatment.\n\nThe Trans-RosaLEE study aims to fill this gap by providing high-throughput molecular profiling (DNA and RNA) of a collection of tumor and blood samples from patients with RH+/HER2- mBC scheduled to start treatment with Kisqali\u00ae + ET. Samples will be collected just prior to initiation of therapy (pre-therapy) and just after discontinuation of therapy in the event of disease progression (post-therapy).\n\nThe main objectives of the TransRosaLEE study are :\n\n* to determine if Kisqali\u00ae + ET treatment causes changes in the DNA and/or RNA genes of tumor;\n* to identify whether there is a molecular signature that would predict clinical outcome of patients treated with Kisqali\u00ae + ET (tumor response, survival);\n* to identify alterations in tumor's genes that could be targeted by a specific treatment and that would allow, in case of progression of the disease, to set up a new adapted treatment.\n\nThe TransRosaLEE study is a collaborative study between the Paoli-Calmettes Institute (France, Marseille) and the pharmaceutical group Novartis. It will take place in up to 90 healthcare institutions in France, and 241 patients will be enrolled. It is closely linked to the non-interventional study RosaLEE promoted by Novartis.",

The interval between the first and the second dose is 28 days, and the rest doses will be administered weekly. The last 6 patients will be assigned to the consecutive multidose group, and will receive a weekly dose of autologous Tris-CAR-T cells for a maximum of 8 weeks. All patients will undergo studies including MRI to evaluate the effect of the CAR-T cells, physical examination, and cerebrospinal fluid cytokine assays to evaluate side effects. All patients will undergo a long-term follow-up.\n\nThe hypothesis is that an adequate amount of Tris-CAR-T cells can be manufactured to complete all the three courses. The other hypothesis is that Tris-CAR-T cells can safely and effectively be administered through the Ommaya reservoir to allow the CAR-T cells to directly interact with the tumor cells for each patient enrolled in the study. The primary aim of the study will be to evaluate the safety of Tris-CAR-T administration. Secondary aims of the study will include evaluating CAR-T cell distribution within cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood, tumor progress post-CAR-T cell infusion, and, if tissue samples from multiple time points are available, also evaluate the degree of target expression, biological characteristics of samples at diagnosis versus at recurrence or progression.",
    "detailed_description": "The autologous Tris-CAR-T cell, targeting both CD44 and CD133, the two inverse correlated targets, introduced truncated IL7Ra to the intracellular domain of the CAR molecule, and has shown ideal survival and tumor suppression in our previous studies. The cells will be tested for safety and kinetics in this clinical trial.\n\nAll patients are required to have an Ommaya reservoir in the tumor resection cavity before CAR-T cell infusion. Ommaya reservoir placement is done by surgery.\n\nAutologous Tris-CAR-T cells will be manufactured via CliniMACS Instrument (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells will be thawed and sterily filled to infuse the patients. Each infusion will take between 5 and 10 minutes. We will then monitor the patient in the hospital for at least 3 days after the first dose of infusion. If the first infusion is tolerated well and the patient is assigned for multidose treatment, a second infusion may be given 28 days after the initial infusion for the first 4 patients (adverse effect assessment), and 7 days for the last 6 patients. Patients will be monitored in the hospital for no longer than 1 day. And the subsequent infusion will be done in the same manner. The treatment will be proceeded in the Department of Neurosurgery, Beijing Tiantan Hospital. Patients who receive multidose treatment will need to stay in Beijing for up to 8 weeks from the first infusion so we can monitor for side effects and will be readmitted to the hospital if patient develops a fever. If patient develops severe fevers after discharge from the hospital, the patient will be readmitted to the hospital for close monitoring for at least one night for safety observation and adverse effects management.\n\nThe first 4 patients will have follow-up visits at weeks 2, 3, and 4, then at months 3, 6, and 9 post-infusion. Patients of the consecutive multidose group will have follow-up visits at week 2, then at months 1 and 3 post-infusion. All patients receive long-term twice a year for a total of 15 years.\n\nMedical tests before treatment--\n\nBefore being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests:\n\n* Physical exam\n* Blood routine, serum biochemical test, kidney and liver function\n* Measurements of the tumor by routine MRI\n\nMedical tests during and after treatment--\n\nThe patient will receive standard medical tests when they are getting the infusions and afterward:\n\n* Physical exams\n* Blood routine, serum biochemical test, kidney and liver function, serum and (or) cerebrospinal fluid analysis\n* Measurements of the tumor by MRI. Cerebrospinal fluid may be drawn from the patient's existing Ommaya reservoir preferentially, or via lumbar puncture before each infusion and at each time of follow-up. This procedure can be done at the bedside under local anesthesia and about 1ml of cerebrospinal fluid will be removed. Additional cerebrospinal fluid may be removed when intracranial hypertension occurs or other clinical needs.\n\nTo learn more about the pharmacokinetics of autologous Tris-CAR-T cells, peripheral blood will be obtained simultaneously with the cerebrospinal fluid collection. The amount of blood taken will be based on clinical need, for approximately 5 mL each time.\n\nIf the tumor samples of the patients are obtained, we will request a sample to be used for research purposes.\n\nThe patient will receive supportive care for any acute or chronic cytotoxicity, including blood components, cytokine antagonists, glucocorticoids, antibiotics, and other interventions as appropriate.",

    "brief_summary": "Adult obesity is due to an excess of body fat. This corresponds to all the fat in the body (or adipose tissue). It is opposed to the lean mass which corresponds to the weight of muscles, organs and viscera. It is defined from the body mass index (or BMI). BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight by their height squared.\n\nAccording to these criteria, the prevalence of obesity has reached 17% of the entire adult population in mainland France (ESTENBAN 2015 study). The prevalence figures for obesity in the French overseas departments are higher than in mainland France. The latest epidemiological data available in Martinique and Guadeloupe (KANNARI 2015 study) show that approximately 60% of the adult population is overweight and 25% of the adult population is obese.\n\nObesity is considered a chronic disease that increases the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic complications all the more when patients have a BMI \u2265 35 kg/m2, defining severe obesity. When BMI is equal to or exceeds 40 kg/m2, obesity is said to be \"morbid\" and the risk of cardiovascular complications increases by about 100% to 400% depending on the type of complications. The risk of mortality increases by 50 to 100% compared to the normal weight population.\n\nObesity and inflammation Adipose tissue accumulates around the abdominal viscera after the fat storage capacity of the subcutaneous territories has been reached. The accumulation of visceral fat is accompanied by a low-grade inflammatory response that is responsible for the secretion of lipid derivatives and mediators toxic to the cardiovascular system and insulin sensitivity. The inflammatory response is characterized by the expression of numerous pro-inflammatory molecules synthesized by adipocytes and immunocompetent single-macrophage cells infiltrating the vascular stroma of adipose tissue. In addition, hyperglycemia and excess lipid intermediates cause the assembly of inflammasomes in the cytosol. Among them, the NLRP3 inflammasome involved in multiple human inflammatory pathologies.\n\nInflammation opposes weight loss, hence the need to reduce the inflammatory response to facilitate weight loss in obese people.\n\nPigeon pea, known for its anti-inflammatory properties, is a legume found in Creole gardens and traditionally eaten at Christmas.\n\nThe OBESICA study aims at studying the interest of consuming pigeon pea associated with regular physical activity on the inflammatory state of the body and weight loss in obese patients.",
    "detailed_description": "Obesity is a generic term for excess body fat. In adults, the World Health Organization (WHO) defines overweight and obesity by a body mass index (BMI) \u2265 25 kg/m2 and 30 kg/m2, respectively. According to these criteria, the prevalence of obesity has reached 17% of the entire adult population in France (ESTENBAN 2015 study). Obesity prevalence figures in the French overseas departments are higher than in France : 60% of the adult population in Martinique and Guadeloupe is overweight and 25% of the adult population is obese (KANNARI 2015 study).\n\nObesity increases the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic complications even more when patients have a BMI \u2265 of 35 kg/m2, defining severe obesity. When the BMI is equal to or greater than 40 kg/m2, obesity is said to be \"morbid\" and the risk of cardiovascular complications increases by between 100% and 400% depending on the type of complications. The risk of mortality increases in the order of 50 to 100% compared to the normal weight population. However, some individuals do not present cardio-metabolic abnormalities despite a significant excess of fat.\n\nSeveral studies show that cardiovascular and metabolic complications are indeed linked to the accumulation of abdominal visceral fat.\n\nAn abdominal girth \u2265 94 cm in men and \u2265 80 cm in women defines abdominal obesity and predicts a high risk of cardiovascular complications. While in France, abdominal obesity affects about 40% of adults, it affects 47% of men and up to 70% of women in overseas territories.\n\nThe accumulation of visceral fat is accompanied by a low-grade inflammatory response that is responsible for the secretion of lipid derivatives and mediators that are toxic to the cardiovascular system and insulin sensitivity.\n\nThe inflammatory response is characterized by the expression of numerous pro-inflammatory molecules synthesized in particular by adipocytes. In addition to the activation of nuclear transcription factors such as NF\u03baB and AP-1, metabolic danger signals such as hyperglycemia and excess lipid intermediates induce the assembly of multi-protein platforms in the cytosol called inflammasomes including the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n\nActivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome activates caspase-1 which its proteolytic activity is responsible for the release of the cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 into tissue and circulating blood.\n\nStrategies that decrease the inflammatory state and the volume of intra-abdominal fat are a therapeutic goal to limit the occurrence of cardiovascular complications and insulin resistance in the obese.\n\nIn this context, it is suggested that reducing the inflammatory response could improve weight loss in obese people. Regular physical activity and a healthy diet have clearly demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects and are effective in weight loss in obese patients.\n\nSeveral epidemiological and clinical studies highlight the potential \"health\" effects of molecules with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties contained in fruits and vegetables, called phyto-micronutrients. In obese patients, phyto-micronutrients such as certain polyphenols of the flavonoid class are beneficial on plasma markers of inflammation, insulin resistance, lipid profile and weight loss. Among legume seeds, Cajanus cajan or pigeon pea represents an interesting variety because of its high content of non-thermosensitive flavonoids of the isoflavone type (genistein and daidzein). In the French Overseas Departments (DOMs).\n\nWe hypothesize that the resumption of adapted physical activity and the reintroduction of polyphenol-rich tropical legume seeds in the diet could bring a benefit in the management of severe obesity in overseas territories by reducing the activation of inflammation mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome and facilitating the reduction of abdominal visceral fat and weight loss.",

    "brief_summary": "In Israel, of the \\~1000 patients diagnosed annually with pancreatic cancer (PC), approximately 250 (25 percent) will be eligible for curative surgery, of which 80 percent will succumb to post-surgical metastatic disease. A reduction in post-surgical metastatic disease will save dozens of patients in Israel annually, and tens-of thousands-around the world. The short perioperative period (days to weeks around surgery) is characterized by stress-inflammatory responses, including catecholamines (CAs, e.g., adrenaline) and prostaglandins (PGs, e.g., prostaglandin-E2) release, and induce deleterious pro-metastatic effects. Animal studies implicated excess perioperative release of CAs and PGs in facilitating cancer progression by affecting the malignant tissue, its local environment, and anti-metastatic immune functions. Congruently, our animal studies indicate that combined use of the beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, and the prostaglandins inhibitor, etodolac - but neither drug separately - efficiently prevented post-operative metastatic development. We recently conducted two clinical trials in three medical centers in Israel, recruiting breast (n=38) and colorectal (n=34) cancer patients, assessing the safety and short-term efficacy of perioperative propranolol and etodolac treatment. Drugs were well tolerated, without severe adverse events. Importantly, molecular/biological analyses of the excised primary tumor indicated that drug treatment caused promising anti-metastatic transformations, as well as improvements in immune and inflammatory indices. These included (i) decreased tumor cell capacity to migrate, (ii) reduced pro-metastatic capacity of the malignant tissue, and (iii) improvement in immune infiltrating into the tumor (Paper published in Clinical Cancer Research, 2017). Herein, we propose to conduct a double-blind placebo-controlled two-arm Phase II clinical trial in 210 pancreatic cancer patients undergoing curative surgery in Israel. A perioperative 35-day drug treatment will be initiated 5 days before surgery. Primary outcomes will include (i) 1-year disease-free-survival (DFS), and 5-year overall survival (OS); and (ii) biological markers in blood samples, and in the excised tumor tissue. Secondary outcomes will include safety indices and psychological measures of depression, anxiety, distress, and fatigue.",

The epigenetic regulator TET2 is the gene most often affected in CCUS. Preclinical studies have shown that active demethylation by the TET enzymes is dependent on vitamin C, and the investigators and collaborators have shown that plasma vitamin C levels are exceedingly low in hematological cancer patients but are easily corrected by oral vitamin C. This study is part of an array of EVITA studies aimed at clarifying whether the standard of care of patients with myeloid malignancies should be changed and oral vitamin C supplement added to the treatment recommendations.",
    "detailed_description": "BACKGROUND Recent investigations have shown that mutations in epigenetic regulators are common, both in the apparently normal hematopoiesis of the elderly and in patients (pts) with myeloid cancers. It was long anticipated that DNA methylation was a permanent silencing mark, but with the discovery of the ten eleven translocation (TET) enzymes it became clear that active demethylation occurs. The initial steps in this process are catalyzed by TET enzymes, which are, however, frequently mutated and methylated in hematological cancers. The Jumonji enzymes, which catalyze histone demethylation, are also aberrantly regulated in hematological cancers.\n\nVitamin C (VitC) was identified in the 1930'ies as the necessary micronutrient in the prevention of scurvy. Unlike plants and most animals, humans are unable to synthesize vitC from glucose due to lack of the required enzyme, L-gulonolactone oxidase. Therefore, vitC must be provided through the diet. Recent studies recognize vitC as an important cofactor for the Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase family. These include the TET enzymes, which are involved in the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) to its oxidized derivatives 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), 5-carboxyl cytosine (5-caC), and 5-formylcytosine (5-fC), and the Jumonji enzymes that are involved in histone demethylation. Accordingly, vitC may potentially play an important role in the regulation of DNA and histone demethylation. However, \\> 80 percentage of hematological cancer pts were found to be severely vitC deficient. Interestingly, analyses of 20 participants included in the investigators' recently conducted randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study (NCT02877277) show that the level of vitC in MDS and CMML pts undergoing treatment with azacitidine, is easily elevated to the normal range by oral vitC supplement (unpublished data). When pts that were already taking vitC supplements were switched to placebo, the vitC levels quickly dropped below the normal range.\n\nIt has also been shown that the formation of 5-hmC and its derivatives may be compromised in healthy individuals and pts with TET mutations. However, since many of these mutations are heterozygous, and since the three TET enzymes (TET1, TET2, and TET3) may have some redundancy, restoration of vitC to physiological levels might have an impact on the level of 5-hmC/5-mC in individuals with TET mutant clonal hematopoiesis or hematological cancer.\n\nAnalyses of 5-hmC/5-mC levels in peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells (MNCs) from the participants in the pilot study also showed a clear trend toward increased 5-hmC in the vitC arm, however, after designing the trial the investigators realized that 5-hmC/5-mC levels are better measured in hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow (BM) where the levels are 10-20 fold higher. Thus, the pilot study will be followed-up with a randomized placebo-controlled trial of oral vitC in individuals with low-risk myeloid malignancies; i.e., CCUS or low-risk MDS/CMML, to investigate if oral vitC can change the biology of these disease entities and ultimately prevent progression.\n\nHypotheses:\n\n1. The investigators and collaborators have previously shown that cancer pts are vitC deficient, and individuals with CCUS, which represents pre-MDS, might also be vitC deficient. The hypothesis is that this may lead to reduced levels of 5-hmC/5-mC in vivo in both cancer pts and individuals with CCUS\n2. Elevating serum vitC levels to the normal range in CCUS and low-risk MDS/CMML pts by oral supplementation with vitC may\n\n   * reduce the malignant clone,\n   * increase the 5-hmC/5-mC ratio,\n   * change the plasma cytokine profile towards a less inflammatory, less tumorigenic profile,\n   * change gene expression\n\nAims:\n\nTo determine if restoring vitC to the normal range in CCUS and low-risk MDS/CMML pts can:\n\n1. reduce the malignant clone,\n2. increase the 5-hmC/5-mC ratio in CCUS and low-risk MDS/CMML pts\n3. reduce accumulation of 5-mC at promoters/enhancers/long terminal repeats (LTRs), or at other regulatory genomic regions of tumor suppressors/methylated driver genes/genes involved in hematopoietic development,\n4. upregulate the expression of these genes,\n5. change the plasma cytokine profile,\n6. alter intestinal permeability (measured by concentration of bacterial DNA in peripheral blood) and/or composition of gut microbiota,\n7. entail any safety risks.\n\nRESEARCH PLAN A total of 100 patients is planned for enrolment. Individuals with CCUS, low-risk MDS, or CMML-0 or -1 will be included from Rigshospitalet, Herlev University Hospital, Odense University Hospital, Aalborg University Hospital or Keck Hospital of University of Southern California between November 2017-December 2021.\n\nThe participants will enter block randomization with a ratio of 1:1; vitC 1000 mg/day p.o. versus placebo for one year.\n\nUp to 30 healthy elderly volunteers are planned for enrolment. Amount and type of bacterial DNA in PB will be determined and serve as controls.\n\nMATERIAL AND MEASUREMENTS PB: PB samples (45 mL) will be taken at study entry and every 3 months (or more if required according to physician's choice) during the first year.\n\nMeasurements include blood counts including differential count, levels of folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin D, iron, ferritin, transferrin, transferrin saturation, plasma vitC levels, cytokines, and bacterial DNA content (referenced to bacterial DNA on patient's skin and in feces).\n\nBM: BM samples (18 mL) will be taken at study entry, after 3 months, and after one year.\n\nLevels of vitC and various cytokines will be measured. Mutations in genes frequently involved in myeloid cancer/clonal hematopoiesis, including epigenetic regulators, and variant allele frequencies (VAF) will be investigated by targeted next generation sequencing in sorted BM CD34+ cells (if available) or BM negative fraction of CD34+ sorting at study entry, after 3 months and after one year.\n\nRNA sequencing and total 5-hmC/5-mC assessment will be performed on BM CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells.\n\nFeces: Feces samples (9 mL) will be collected from a subset of patients at study entry, after 3 months, and after one year. Bacterial DNA will be extracted and sequenced.\n\nRESEARCH BIOBANK A research biobank will be established at The Epi-/Genome Laboratory, Rigshospitalet / Biotech Research and Innovation Centre to store the biological samples from the participants. The research biobank is approved by the Regional Science Ethics Committee and the Danish Data Protection Agency in accordance with the Act on Processing of Personal Data (license no. H-16022249 and 04864/RH-2016-259, respectively). Cryopreserved separated MNCs from BM and PB will be stored in addition to granulocyte pellets and plasma. The date for closing the research biobank is 31-12-2030.\n\nFor correlative studies, biological samples will be sent to Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, US, and Imperial College, London, UK (external collaborators), for RNA sequencing and analyses of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, respectively. Biological samples will also be sent to Life Science Faculty, University of Copenhagen, and The National Veterinary Institute, Technical University of Denmark (external collaborators) for measurement of serum vitC concentrations and analyses of T cell responses, respectively.\n\nMETHODS VitC measurement: Ascorbate and total vitC, i.e., ascorbate + dehydroascorbic acid (the oxidized form of vitC; DHA), are quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with coulometric detection; DHA is assessed by subtraction of ascorbate from total vitC. Uric acid is used as endogenous internal standard.\n\nCell sorting: Magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS, using a EasySep device).\n\nTotal 5-hmC/5-mC measurement: Dot blot analysis of 5-hmC. 5-hmC/5-mC measurement by Mass Spectrometry.\n\nLocus specific 5-hmC/5-mC measurement: \"EPIC\" 850 K BeadChips. 5-hmC/5-mC at selected sites will be measured by pyrosequencing.\n\nGene expression: Total RNA sequencing and reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction.\n\nMutation detection: Targeted next generation sequencing of a panel of genes recurrently mutated in myeloid cancer as described.\n\nSTATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND POWER CALCULATION This study is the first study to examine the effects of vitC as monotherapy on 5-hmC/5-mC levels in hematopoietic stem cells in humans in vivo. Therefore, it is not possible to perform a power calculation or a sample size calculation. The number of participants (n=100) is set as an estimate of the number needed to observe a potential significant difference between the groups (vitC vs. placebo) in the primary endpoint; median change in VAF of somatic mutations from baseline to 12 months.\n\nEfficacy analyses are by intention-to-treat. Safety analyses include all participants who receive at least one dose of protocol therapy.\n\nETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The study has been approved by the Regional Science Ethics Committee (H-16022249) and the Danish Data Protection Agency (04864/RH-2016-259).\n\nAll participants included in the project will be informed orally and in writing. Participation will only be accepted after written consent. Participants will be informed that they can at any time for any reason withdraw from the study without it affecting their treatment in the health care system.\n\nUsing the targeted DNA sequencing approach described, there is a small risk of detecting a germline mutation in the participants related to myeloid malignancy. The participants will be asked to state in the informed consent if they do not want to receive any further relevant health-related information that may appear during the project analyses. Unless the participant explicitly states that he or she does not want to be informed of any potential health-related random findings in the study, the participant will be informed and offered further investigations and genetic counseling at the local hospital in case of random findings.\n\nPatient disadvantages, side effects, risks, and complications Blood sampling is associated with brief discomfort and/or pain. No significant risks are associated with the blood sampling. Local bleeding can occur, which in rare cases can cause discomfort and discoloration for a few days. Rarely, a blood sampling can cause vasovagal reaction leading to a brief loss of consciousness.\n\nBM aspiration is associated with brief pain while the local anesthesia is given. Furthermore, many individuals experience an uncomfortable feeling in the nates and leg while the BM is aspirated. This lasts approximately 30 seconds. Finally, some tenderness can occur for a few days after the procedure. Possible complications to undergoing a BM investigation include bleeding and infection. However, the incidence of these complications is extremely low.\n\nAccording to the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations there is no evidence that intake of vitC above 1000 mg/day are either carcinogenic or teratogenic. However, high intakes (\\> 1000-2000 mg/day) may cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal disturbances and susceptible individuals may experience kidney stone formation from increased oxalate formation. Since vitC is only given at physiological doses, it is anticipated that the study is safe and will provide no additional risk for the participants; an assumption that is supported by the experience from the pilot study.",

    "brief_summary": "This study is a prospective randomized controlled trial, enrolling 70 patients with CKD stages 2-4, randomly divided into a control group and a treatment group, with 35 cases in each group. The study subjects are sourced from three centers. The control group receives integrated basic treatment for chronic kidney disease, including dietary nutrition adjustment, blood pressure control, blood sugar control, lipid control, anemia treatment, and regulation of water, electrolyte, and acid-base metabolic balance. The treatment group, in addition to the basic treatment, is administered Nephropathy Formula No. 1 orally, with a treatment course of 12 weeks and a follow-up period of 2 weeks. The outcome measures are the changes in biochemical indicators, inflammatory factors, T cell subsets, STAT3 mRNA expression, and TCM syndrome scores after 12 weeks of treatment, to assess therapeutic efficacy. This study proposes the experimental hypothesis that Nephropathy Formula No. 1 can effectively improve the T cell immune balance in CKD patients by modulating the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting the occurrence and development of renal fibrosis and improving the prognosis of CKD to a certain extent. Specifically, Nephropathy Formula No. 1 may function through the following mechanisms: (1) downregulating IL-6 mRNA expression, reducing IL-6 secretion, and thereby inhibiting the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway; (2) regulating the balance of Th17/Treg cell subsets, promoting the differentiation of Th17 cells into Treg cells, enhancing the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of Treg cells, and alleviating renal inflammatory responses and fibrosis. Through in-depth exploration of this study, it is expected to provide new ideas and methods for the clinical treatment of CKD, with significant scientific and clinical implications.",
    "detailed_description": "Sample Size Estimation Sample size estimation is based on the results of a pilot study. A total of 60 patients are required for enrollment. Considering a dropout rate of 10%-15%, each group will need 35 cases, with a total of 70 cases for both groups.\n\nPatient Recruitment Patients will be recruited by researchers during outpatient or inpatient visits. After screening according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible patients will be enrolled in the study following the signing of the informed consent form.\n\nAdverse Events and Serious Adverse Events Management Severity: Physicians can use the following definitions to judge the severity of all adverse events and serious adverse events, which will serve as endpoints/data cutoff points for the study.\n\nMild: Adverse events are transient and easily tolerated by the patient. Moderate: Adverse events cause discomfort to the subject and interfere with their normal activities.\n\nSevere: Adverse events significantly impact the subject's daily activities and may result in functional loss or be life-threatening.\n\nManagement of Adverse Events: In the clinical trial, if any adverse event occurs, regardless of its causal relationship with the investigational drug or the treatment method used, the researcher must take necessary measures for treatment and rescue. For adverse events that occur during the trial, the type, severity, onset time, duration, management measures, and course of action should be recorded in the inpatient medical record and the case report form. A comprehensive analysis should be conducted to determine whether the event is related to the trial. After an adverse event occurs, the researcher may decide whether the subject should discontinue the clinical trial based on the condition. For cases terminated due to serious adverse events, follow-up and recording of their outcomes should be conducted.\n\nRecording and Reporting of Serious Adverse Events: If a serious adverse event occurs during the trial, regardless of its relationship to the trial, immediate emergency measures should be taken, and the principal investigator and the ethics committee should be notified by phone within 24 hours. Subsequently, a serious adverse event report form should be completed and promptly submitted to the aforementioned departments.\n\nMonitoring and Recording of Adverse Events This includes any symptoms, signs, and laboratory abnormalities that occur from the time of signing the informed consent form to the end of the last visit. The occurrence of adverse events should be specifically described, including the time of occurrence, severity, duration, measures taken, and outcome. All adverse events should be recorded in the designated case report form for adverse events.\n\nData Management Researchers are required to fill in the collected data into the case report form according to the study protocol and use EXCEL software for data collection or recording. Data management will be handled by a designated person to ensure the authenticity, completeness, and accuracy of the clinical trial data. At the end of the study, researchers will submit all the case report forms of the enrolled patients to the data management center. These case report forms should be complete and signed. Consistency of data collected from various research centers will be checked, and queries will be issued for any inconsistencies, which the researchers will need to clarify. Missing data will be preserved but not included in the statistical analysis.\n\nData Description Quantitative data will be described using mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD), median, maximum, minimum, and quartiles. Categorical data will be represented as percentages (%).\n\nData Statistics All statistical tests, unless otherwise specified, will use a two-sided test. A P-value of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Comparisons of general conditions among groups will be analyzed using appropriate methods based on data type and distribution. For example, comparisons of quantitative indicators between groups will use one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (for homoscedasticity and normal distribution) or the Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test (for non-normal distribution); categorical indicators will use the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test (if the chi-square test is not applicable), and ordinal indicators will use the Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test or the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test. A P-value of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.\n\nStatistical Analysis Plan This will be completed by professional statisticians. After all data entry and review are completed, statisticians should promptly conduct the statistical analysis and produce a written statistical analysis report.",

    "brief_summary": "Rationale: Worldwide, the aging population is increasing. Aging is associated with loss of independence and increased risk of co-morbidity. Sufficient protein intake is imperative to maintain skeletal muscle mass and overall health, and thereby stimulates active aging. It has been suggested that age-dependent changes in gastrointestinal (GI) tract physiology affect the amount of protein digested and absorbed, as well as the intestinal microbiota. However, it is not clear to what extent actual protein digestion and absorption are altered in older individuals. So far, no human data on the expression and activity of brush border enzymes and protein-related transporters in small intestinal epithelial cells are available. Understanding the age-dependent digestion and absorption kinetics of protein is important for creating specific diets in older individuals to improve protein intake and thereby stimulate healthy aging.\n\nObjective: To assess the effects of aging on protein digestion and amino acid absorption in healthy humans in vivo.\n\nStudy design: Cross-sectional Study population: 12 healthy, non-obese (BMI 18.5-30kg/m2) young adults (age: 18-35 y inclusive) and 12 community dwelling older adults (age: \u226567 y).\n\nIntervention: Subjects will undergo a standardized heavy water dosing protocol for 2 days (1 \"loading day\", 1 \"maintenance day\"). Blood and saliva sampling will be conducted throughout the heavy water dosing protocol to determine body water and amino acid enrichment levels. On the experimental test day, a gastroscopy with collection of duodenal mucosa tissue samples will be performed to allow assessment of the expression and activity of brush border enzymes and protein-related transporters, and to determine fractional duodenal mucosal protein synthesis rate. Fecal samples will be collected at baseline and after the gastroscopy.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: The primary study parameter is the mRNA expression of brush border enzymes and small peptide and amino acid transporters in duodenal mucosal cells. Secondary study parameters include protein expression of brush border enzymes and small peptide and amino acid transporters in duodenal mucosal cells, fecal microbial fermentation metabolites and duodenal mucosal protein synthesis rate.",
    "detailed_description": "Worldwide, the proportion of older individuals in the population is increasing. The progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass with aging, or sarcopenia, has a major impact on our health care system and costs due to increased morbidity and a greater need for hospitalization and/or institutionalization. A sufficient protein intake is imperative to maintain skeletal muscle mass and overall health, and thereby stimulates active aging. Whereas the overall protein intake is generally lower in older as compared to young adults, findings indicate that older adults need more protein to increase muscle protein synthesis, known as anabolic resistance. The exact mechanisms underlying anabolic resistance are not fully discovered yet. Age-dependent changes in gastrointestinal tract physiology have been suggested as a potential cause.\n\nFollowing protein ingestion, protein is cleaved into small peptides and amino acids by digestive enzymes secreted in the stomach (pepsin) and small intestinal lumen (pancreatic trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase), as well as brush border enzymes (aminopeptidase, carboxypeptidase, dipeptidase). Brush border enzymes are responsible for the final digestion of small peptides into dipeptides, tripeptides and amino acids. Subsequently, these small peptides and amino acids are absorbed across the intestinal mucosa by various membrane-bound transporters. The majority of dietary-protein derived amino acids is released into the systemic circulation and transported and taken up by various peripheral tissues in the postprandial phase.\n\nIt has been shown that postprandial plasma amino acid availability is lower in older compared to young adults. This indicates that digestion and absorption of proteins are likely attenuated in older individuals, thereby reducing the systemic availability of protein-derived amino acids for muscle protein synthesis and other relevant physiological processes.\n\nLimited studies have focused on changes in gastrointestinal tract physiology with aging. Human studies on the expression and activity of brush border enzymes and protein transporters (i.e. for dipeptides, tripeptides and amino acids) being crucial for the final steps of digestion and absorption, respectively, are lacking. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to assess the expression and activity of brush border enzymes and expression of protein transporters in small intestinal epithelial cells in older as compared to young adults.",

    "detailed_description": "Background: Peripheral insulin resistance is a major risk factor for metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Skeletal muscle accounts for the majority of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, hence restoring insulin action in skeletal muscle is key in the prevention of type 2 diabetes. Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in the etiology of muscle insulin resistance. Also, as mitochondrial function is determined by its proteome quantity and quality, alterations in the muscle mitochondrial proteome may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance. However, insulin resistance is multifactorial in nature and whether mitochondrial derangements are a cause or a consequence of impaired insulin action is unclear. In recent years, the study of humans with genetic mutations has shown enormous potential to establish the mechanistic link between two physiological variables; indeed, if the mutation has a functional impact on one of those variables, then the direction of causality can be readily ascribed. Mitochondrial myopathies are genetic disorders of the mitochondrial respiratory chain affecting predominantly skeletal muscle. Mitochondrial myopathies are caused by pathogenic mutations in either nuclear or mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which ultimately lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. Although the prevalence of mtDNA mutations is just 1 in 5,000, the study of patients with mtDNA defects has the potential to provide unique information on the pathogenic role of mitochondrial derangements that is disproportionate to the rarity of affected individuals. The m.3243A\\>G mutation in the MT-TL1 gene encoding the mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA 1 gene is the most common mutation leading to mitochondrial myopathy in humans. The m.3243A\\>G mutation is associated with impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Most importantly, insulin resistance precedes impairments of \u03b2-cell function in carriers of the m.3243A\\>G mutation, making these patients an ideal human model to study the causative nexus between muscle mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance. Exercise training is a potent stimulus to enhance muscle insulin action, improve mitochondrial function, and promote mitochondrial proteome remodeling. Accordingly, rescue of mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed to play a role in the insulin-sensitizing effect of exercise. Yet, numerous mechanisms may contribute to the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and the beneficial effects of exercise may be linked to amelioration of multiple factors, thus challenging the interpretation of the functional significance of improved muscle mitochondrial function per se. Nevertheless, since mitochondrial dysfunction is likely the primary cause of muscle insulin resistance in carriers of the m.3243A\\>G mutation, prospective studies including an in-depth analysis of the mitochondrial adaptations elicited by exercise training in this cohort of patients may offer a unique opportunity to identify those mitochondrial derangements that, once rescued, drive enhancements in insulin sensitivity.\n\nObjective: To study the effects of exercise training on muscle insulin sensitivity, muscle mitochondrial function, and the muscle mitochondrial proteome in individuals harboring pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations associated with an insulin-resistant phenotype.\n\nStudy design: Within-subject parallel-group longitudinal study in individuals with pathogenic mtDNA mutations undergoing an exercise training intervention with one leg (contralateral leg as inactive control).\n\nEndpoint: Differences between the trained and the untrained leg.",

    "detailed_description": "AIM: To explore if VitalScan MCG parameters are able to predict future ICD therapies in patients who meet the requirements for ICD therapy.\n\nMagnetocardiography (MCG) Magnetocardiography (MCG) is a non-invasive, non-contact body-surface method which uses magnetometers to measure and map the magnetic fields generated by the electrical activity within the heart. It offers a better spatial resolution than an ECG recording and opens the possibility of detecting conduction characteristics consistent with arrhythmogenesis.\n\nThe application of MCG has been limited by feasibility as devices up to now have been based on superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID) with super cooled sensors. These machines were often operated in a shielded environment, to decrease magnetic field interference (noise) from electrical devices and other sources of magnetic fields. This was a major limiting factor in deploying these devices in a working environment especially considering, that most hospital wards will have numerous devices that can interfere with the device.\n\nThe investigators will be evaluating the use of a portable magnetometer which measures the change in magnetic fields rather than an absolute magnetic field as measured by SQUID magnetometers used in the trials mentioned above. It has been developed to be more affordable and more feasible than SQUID magnetometers as it is designed to be operated at room temperature in an unshielded environment. The investigators will be evaluating its ability to measure parameters identified in previous literature as well as other novel parameters that may be identified from acquiring the MCG derivative. With the development of this portable magnetometer designed to be used in an unshielded environment, there is real potential for screening a large numbers of patients for SCD risk. Until this trial, this novel tool has not been evaluated in this role.\n\nMCG parameters in Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) Whilst there are limited data on the role of MCG in predicting arrhythmic events, a series of studies involving patients with ischaemic heart disease have shown a correlation between MCG characteristics and the presence of ventricular arrhythmias. Specifically QRS fragmentation and late fields of the QRS have been associated with a higher incidence of ventricular arrhythmia. A trial of 49 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy demonstrated parameters present on MCG scans which were able to distinguish between participants, retrospectively, who had a ventricular arrhythmia in comparison to those who did not. The authors associated the features in the MCG T wave (specifically prolongation of the end part of the T wave) with the presence of ventricular arrhythmias. Kawakami et al prospectively studied ventricular arrhythmia risk in 51 patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy for a mean follow-up of 2.9 years. They found that MCG left intraventricular disorganised conduction described as a deviation from the typical global clockwise LV depolarisation was predictive of major adverse cardiac events..\n\nProposed trial The aim of this trial is to show a correlation between features consistent with arrhythmogenic substrate from a VitalScan MCG and future ventricular arrhythmias; measured from observed arrhythmic events from ICD interrogation of patients at risk of SCD. The investigators hope therefore to describe MCG features most predictive of future ventricular arrhythmias.\n\nTo achieve this aim the investigators plan to perform a multi-centre cohort trial in all patients referred to cardiology at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust and University Hospital of North Midlands. In addition to usual care, participants will have lying and standing blood pressure measured, blood samples taken for the measurement of circulating vascular biomarkers and an MCG performed. Participants will then be segregated by whether their usual treatment pathway involves or has involved the implantation of an ICD. Those patients who do not require an ICD will not receive any further follow up, but will be used to form a control group of patients. Participants who have received an ICD will be observed for any arrhythmic events for a minimum of one year.\n\nAt twelve months participants will be requested to complete a quality of life questionnaire; SF-36 to assess impact of symptoms on their quality of life. Twelve months after the recruitment of the last patient the first phase of the trial will conclude.\n\nThe second phase of the trial involves long term follow up of participants having ICD implants, for duration of five years. This will be observational and participants will not be expected to be involved in any activity above and beyond standard care.\n\nTrial Summary The trial is a dual phase, multi-centre observational cohort trial, attempting to define the parameters of Magnetocardiography (MCG), with an aim to interpret the characteristics of these parameters, which can predict future ventricular arrhythmia and ICD therapies.\n\nPhase one will last a total of 30 months: 12 months to recruit patients, further 18 months to complete patient follow up and for analysis of data.\n\nIf the recruitment target is not met at the 12 month time point, there will be an option to extend this period for a further 6 months.\n\nPhase two will involve long term follow up of the cohort of participants who receive an ICD. This will allow longer time for events requiring ICD therapy to occur. This will involve an annual data collection and reporting. This will continue for five years after the recruitment of the last participant.\n\nStudy population:\n\nThe investigators plan to recruit 510 prospective participants in total out of which 300 \u00b110% in the observation arm (as shown in Figure 1) and 210 participants in the control arm. This will ensure sample size integrity assuming a possible 10% loss to follow up. Prospective participants will be recruited from two sites.

    "brief_summary": "Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) has revolutionized the development of malaria vaccines. It involves the administration of either known numbers of sporozoites or infected erythrocytes to healthy human volunteers under a controlled environment. The use of highly sensitive molecular malaria diagnostic methods informs treatment decisions before symptom development and allows the characterization of parasite growth dynamics. Sporozoite CHMI has safely been used in six countries in Africa providing a platform to assess the efficacy of candidate malaria vaccines and study the natural immunity to malaria. Blood stage CHMI involves administration of known number of Artemether Lumefantrine sensitive infected erythrocytes in healthy volunteers, and it is a more sensitive model for modelling parasite growths and study the efficacy of blood-stage malaria vaccines. It has been safely used in Australia and Europe but not in Africa. Adaptation of this model by administration of combination of suboptimal and optimal antimalarial drugs lead to increased gametocytaemia, and infection rates in mosquitoes following standard membrane feeding assay. Such adaptation allows the model to be used to study parasite transmission from human to mosquitoes and evaluate transmission blocking malaria interventions.\n\nThere is an urgent need to establish an in vivo model for early-stage clinical evaluation of transmission blocking interventions (TBI) in volunteers living in malaria endemic countries. This would allow rapid and cost-effective way to down-select transmission blocking candidate malaria vaccine and gametocidal antimalarial drugs before larger, more complex, and expensive field efficacy studies are conducted. A study done in na\u00efve individual showed 100% success in establishing a malaria infection using 2800 P. falciparum infected RBCs, while a recent study (manuscript in development) has demonstrated success in establishing infection in Tanzanian semi-immune individuals with low malaria exposure using 1000 P. falciparum infected RBCs. We will use 1000 ALU-sensitive 3D7 P. falciparum infected RBCs to establish an in vivo transmission model for studying Transmission blocking interventions and assess the efficiency of two antimalarial drugs regimens (Piperaquine and doxycycline) to induce high levels of gametocytaemia and mosquito infection rates in healthy African adults. We will also investigate the determinants of successful transmission to mosquitoes including underlying immune responses to both asexual and sexual malaria antigens, asexual parasite dynamics and gametocyte burden, sex ratio of male and female gametocytes, and the relationship between gametocyte density and mosquito infection rate",
    "detailed_description": "Adaptation of blood-stage Controlled Human Malaria Infection for evaluation of transmission blocking malaria interventions in malaria endemic countries.\n\nThis will be Phase I Randomized open label trial. It will recruit Healthy male adults aged 18-45 years from low malaria endemic area (Bagamoy0) for three months.\n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria remains a disease of public health significance affecting millions across the globe (1). Scaling up of malaria interventions has reduced the malaria burden in several parts of Africa (2-5), but this has not been consistent everywhere, with some areas reporting sustained or even an increase in the burden of malaria (6, 7). Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective public health interventions (8, 9) and would play a critical role in the elimination efforts. There is a significant development in research to identify promising transmission-blocking malaria vaccines, with several candidate vaccines in the pipeline. To down-select the most promising candidates, antibody tests and functional assays that prevent infection of mosquitoes are normally used (10). It is however unclear how well these assays represent the in vivo transmission-blocking efficacy making it difficult to choose which candidate to develop further (11). Before a transmission blocking vaccine (TBV) can be approved, a randomized trial to evaluate the effect on gametocyte carriage and transmission to mosquitoes or Phase 3 trial to demonstrate vaccine impact on the incidence of infection in the target population are required. Both study designs are large and expensive (11). Alternatively, accelerated approval could be sought through surrogate markers of efficacy that would require either analytical or biological, but not clinical validation. However currently there is no known surrogate markers. Therefore, in vivo transmission blocking model for early-stage clinical evaluation of TBV is needed to rapidly down-select promising candidate vaccines before large field trials are conducted. Although such model has been studied in malaria na\u00efve population, it is important to establish this model in target populations to provide relevant results that considers the genetic background and underlying natural immunity.",

    "detailed_description": "In observational studies, small daily doses of lithium have been associated with a 77% reduced risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, lithium therapy has been effective in preventing neuronal death and behavioral symptoms in several PD animal models. Recently, our group has shown 24-weeks of low-dose lithium aspartate therapy 45mg/day in PD to engage blood-based and the MRI disease progression biomarker, free water, to a greater extent than 15mg/day or 150mg/day of lithium carbonate. However, these blood-based and MRI biomarker findings stem from only four and two PD patients, respectively, who received lithium aspartate 45mg/day. In addition, two other PD patients receiving this dosage withdrew from the study due to side effects of sedation and dizziness. Subsequently, one of these patients who withdrew resumed lithium aspartate at 30mg/day and reported no side effects. Although these findings suggest that this dosage of lithium aspartate has positive effects on PD biomarkers, data from a larger number of PD patients will be required to justify conducting a larger, randomized controlled trial (RCT). The proposed study will enroll 15 additional PD patients over five months who will receive lithium aspartate 30-45mg/day for 24 weeks ensuring that the study will be completed within 12 months. The dosage will be slowly titrated in each patient up to the maximum tolerated dosage in this range. Blood-based biomarkers and MRIs will be assessed at baseline and 24 weeks. It is anticipated that a similar magnitude of biomarker engagement will be observed among these additional 15 patients as was seen in the handful from the pilot study. Such findings would provide strong preliminary evidence to support conducting a larger RCT including both clinical and biomarker outcomes. Positive results from such a RCT would support lithium aspartate as a disease-modifying therapy for PD.",

    "brief_summary": "Asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) are inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract, asthma from the lower part, and CRS, from the upper part. In theory, these parts are correlated as if they are one single organ, namely \"united airways\", which means that if one is affected by any condition, the other might be impacted as well. However, this relationship has not yet been described down to the cellular and molecular levels. By investigating patients that have (1) asthma and CRS with nasal polyp, (2) asthma and CRS without nasal polyp, and (3) just CRS with nasal polyp, we aim to determine the correlation of the upper and lower part of the respiratory tract. At first, the characterization of disease will be determined by established clinical criteria, such as lung function, blood analysis for the presence of eosinophils (a type of white cells), and nasal polyp score. To continue, in-depth analysis of nose, oropharynx, and lung samples will help gain information about the inflammatory profile and local microbiome of the three different groups of patients through molecular and cellular assays. The results of this study will help to describe the hypothesis of the united airways which will provide better guidance for medical treatment of asthma and CRS with or without polyp, thus improving the life quality of patients.",
    "detailed_description": "1. Background Both, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) are inflammatory conditions of the airways. The prevalence of asthma - with its cardinal symptoms wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing - has risen over the past decades not only in industrial but also in developing countries. For instance, about 8% of the United States' population and 8.2% of Europeans are diagnosed with asthma. Chronic rhinosinusitis with (CRSwNP) and without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) is a condition affecting up to 16% and 11% of the US and European population, respectively3. Both diseases, asthma and CRS, can severely impair quality of life as well as productivity and therefore embody an immense socioeconomic burden.\n\n   Despite the distinction of the respiratory tract in the upper and lower airways, both parts are anatomically and immunologically related. This led to the concept of \"United airway diseases\" assuming that upper and lower airways form a single organ. Consequently, inflammation in the upper affects the lower respiratory tract and vice versa. This concept initially described in the context of allergic respiratory disease can also be extended to the link between sinonasal and lower airway diseases. Accordingly, the association between asthma and CRS prevalence has been unambiguously shown in epidemiological studies: around 20% of CRSsNP patients and around 48% of CRSwNP patients suffer from asthma. Conversely, nasal polyposis is detected in 19 to 25% of asthmatics. In cases of severe asthma, even up to 54% of patients were reported to have a history of nasal polyposis. However, the pathophysiological mechanism underlying the association of asthma and CRS has been poorly investigated so far.\n\n   Based on the predominant inflammatory profile, asthma can be separated into T2-high and T2-low endotypes. Thereby, around 60% of severe asthma patients show a T2-high profile. The picture is becoming even more complex regarding classifications of CRS. Phenotypically we distinguish between CRSsNP and CRSwNP. However, up to 10 different endotypes of CRS can be defined based on various different inflammatory markers in nasal polyps or nasal secretions. Approaches to characterize endotypes describing conditions involving both asthma and CRS have barely been made so far.\n\n   On a cellular and protein level, it seems that higher concentrations of Staphylococcus enterotoxin-specific IgE, total IgE and eosinophil cationic protein in nasal polyp tissue are indicators for a higher risk of asthma. Furthermore, it was observed that patients with CRS and eosinophilic asthma (as determined by FeNO levels only) show high numbers of eosinophils in their nasal polyps. This nasal polyp eosinophilia was associated with a more severe asthma phenotype as well as larger polyps and a significantly higher nasal polyp recurrence rate compared to non-eosinophilic patients. However, up to this point, no study investigated whether inflammatory profiles in polyps and asthmatic lungs correspond and how inflammatory profiles of patients suffering from asthma with or without polyps may differ.\n\n   Novel antibody-based therapies targeting mediators of type 2 immune response are constantly emerging as new treatment options for patients with severe chronic airway diseases. Therapeutic antibodies targeting IgE or IL-4/IL-13, IL-5, or IL-5 receptor-mediated pathways are currently licensed for the treatment of asthma but have also successfully been used to treat CRSwNP to some extent. In this respect, anti-IgE (omalizumab) and anti-IL4\u03b1 receptor (dupilumab) specific monoclonal antibodies have recently been licensed for the treatment of nasal polyps and CRSwNP respectively. Antibodies targeting molecules further upstream in the inflammatory cascade such as TSLP or IL-33 are currently under development. Anti-TSLP antibodies showed first promising results in clinical trials including patients suffering from uncontrolled asthma. Despite targeting molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of both diseases, some monoclonal antibodies such as reslizumab are effective in treating asthma but fail to significantly ameliorate nasal polyposis. Interestingly, a post-hoc responder analysis showed that the group of patients with high baseline IL-5 levels in nasal secretions improved upon reslizumab treatment, while the other patient groups did not. These findings illustrate the urgent need to better understand the pathomechanism and potential links underlying both diseases in order to choose the right therapy for the right patient.\n2. Study rationale In this study, we aim to unravel the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying T2-high asthma with or without nasal polyposis. Therefore, we plan to thoroughly examine T2-high asthmatic patients with and without nasal polyposis at the cellular and molecular level and compare them to patients suffering from eosinophilic polyps in the absence of asthma. Deep analysis of nose, oropharynx, and lung samples will yield information on inflammatory patterns at protein and mRNA level, cellular tissue architecture in the different disease subtypes as well as microbiome composition. This pilot study will help to unravel underlying pathomechanisms in these united airway diseases and, therefore, provide a rationale for new therapy approaches including biologicals.\n3. Study objectives\n\nIn this study we plan to:\n\n* evaluate the inflammatory profile in different sections of the airways;\n* evaluate the endotype and immunological profile of CRSwNP (when applicable);\n* determine the microbiome composition in nose, oropharynx, and bronchi in T2-high asthmatic patients with and without CRSwNP, N-ERD compared to patients with CRSwNP in absence of asthma",

In males, specifically, certain supplements, such as single antioxidants and trace minerals, have previously been shown to improve sperm function marginally. One hypothesis is that sperm function can be improved even further by combining several different types of supplements (e.g., amino acids, energy carriers, vitamins, antioxidants, and trace minerals) to target several age-related cell pathways, for example, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation and cell energetics. This 3-month placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, aims to test the effects of a novel multi-ingredient supplement (Fertility Enhancer) that targets several age-related cell pathways on sperm function in overweight or obese and subfertile males.",
    "detailed_description": "BACKGROUND: Infertility is characterized by the failure to become pregnant after one year of regular intercourse without the use of contraceptives and impacts 10-15% of couples worldwide. Both male and female partners contribute to a couple's reproductive health, with approximately one third of infertility cases caused by male factors, one third by female factors, and the remaining by either a combination of both or unknown causes. The prevalence of infertility is a growing concern in Canada, as is seen in an increased use of assisted reproductive technology (ART), which may be both invasive and expensive. Cost-effective, safe, and accessible alternatives to ART are therefore needed. The most common cause of subfertility is 'biological aging', characterized by the hallmarks of aging, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative damage and inflammation. Another common cause of male and female subfertility is obesity, which is associated with multisystemic oxidative damage and inflammation.\n\nPURPOSE: The aim of this placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial is to test the effects of a multi-ingredient supplement (Fertility Enhancer) designed to target several aging- and obesity-related pathways on World Health Organization (WHO) semen quality parameters in overweight and obese and subfertile males (sperm count, motility, morphology and vitality).\n\nSAMPLE-SIZE ESTIMATE AND DESIGN: Sperm count/concentration is strongly correlated to all World Health Organization semen quality parameters. With significance set at 0.05 (Z = 1.96) and power to 0.8 (Z = 0.84), a sample-size of 17-32 per group is sufficient to detect an increase of 10 x 10\\^6 spermatozoa/mL with a standard deviation of 15 to 20 x 10\\^6 spermatozoa/mL. Thus, sixty-four (n = 64) males between 25 and 50 years of age that are confirmed overweight or obese and subfertile will be randomized into age-matched Placebo (PLA, n = 32) vs Fertility Enhancer (FE, n = 32) groups and undergo daily supplementation for 3 months.\n\nSUPPLEMENTS: The FE supplement contains energy carriers (creatine), conditionally essential amino acids (arginine), Omega 3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA), vitamins (B9, B12, E, and D3), antioxidants (CoQ10 and alpha lipoic acid), trace minerals (selenium, iron, zinc, and copper), and plant extracts (beet root, green tea, and green coffee bean). The isocaloric and inactive placebo contains safflower oil, microcrystalline cellulose and sugar and is identical in flavor to FE.\n\nCO-PRIMARY OUTCOMES: All outcomes will be measured at baseline and post intervention for assessing % pre-to-post changes. Co-primary outcomes are body composition by dual x-ray absorptiometry, including lean mass to fat mass ratio (body composition index; BCI) and total fat mass, and the WHO semen quality parameters; specifically, % improvements in sperm count, motility, morphology, and vitality.\n\nSECONDARY OUTCOMES: Secondary outcomes are % improvements in sperm DNA fragmentation (flow cytometry-assessed) and markers of oxidative damage (protein carbonyls, lipid peroxidation, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine)), inflammation (interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6), apoptosis (total and cleaved caspase 3), cell cycle arrest (p16 and p21), mitochondrial biogenesis (complexes I-V), antioxidant status (superoxide dismutases 1 and 2), and energy state (ATP and phosphocreatine).\n\nOTHER: Additional outcomes are body morphology (bodyweight, waist/height ratio, and body mass index), other body composition outcomes (lean mass and appendicular skeletal muscle mass index), and blood markers of oxidative damage (malondialdehyde), inflammation (c-reactive protein, interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6), antioxidant status (ORAC, TEAC), liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine) and energy state (ATP \\& phosphocreatine levels).\n\nHYPOTHESIS: The main hypothesis of the current trial is that co-primary body composition outcomes and the World Health Organization (WHO) semen quality parameters (count, motility, morphology, and/or vitality) will be significantly improved following FE supplementation and superior to PLA.\n\nSTATISTICS: A standard omnibus one-way repeated measures ANOVA F-test followed by Duncan post hoc analyses will be used for all parametric data analyses. Non-parametric equivalents will be used for non-normally distributed data with significance set at p = 0.05. Delta pre-post changes (% improvements) for all outcomes within and between groups are biologically relevant and planned a priori comparisons.",

    "brief_summary": "Chronic psychosis, including schizophrenia is now viewed as a progressive disorder where cognitive deficits predate the clinical onset. Early intervention programs improve the general outcome with staged care strategies, supporting the view that the period before and around the first episode of psychosis is a window of opportunity for improving its functional recovery.\n\nPioneering epigenetic analyses indicate that psychosis onset involves oxidative stress and inflammation suggesting that neuroprotective strategies could limit or even prevent the onset of or the transition into a chronic disorder. Several biological factors associated with the emergence of psychosis can all be rectified by using safe and easily accepted supplements including alterations folate deficiency/hyperhomocysteinemia; redox imbalance and deficit in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The prevalence of these anomalies (20-30%) justifies a systematic detection and could guide personalised add-on strategy.\n\nCognitive remediation improves quality of life (QoL) and functional outcome in patients with chronic psychosis. It would even be more efficacious in the early phase of psychosis by tackling the negative impact of psychosis on education achievement and employment. However, cognitive dysfunctions are often overlooked in patients at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis and patient with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) and cognitive remediation is not always accessible. New technologies can provide us with youth-friendly, non-stigmatising tools, such as applications with cognitive strategies, motivational tools and functioning guidance personalised according to the need of each individual. Patients can have access to it, wherever they live.\n\nEarly psychosis can be associated with inflammation, metabolic deficiency, as well as early structural brain anomalies that reflect brain plasticity abilities and could influence the prognosis and response to cognitive training.\n\nThe study hypothesis is that promoting neuroplasticity by cognitive training and personalised virtual psychoeducation guidance could attenuate or reverse early cognitive deficits and improve the overall functional outcome in young patients UHR or FEP and that this effect is modulated by individual brain plasticity abilities. The overall objective of PsyCARE_trial is to improve early intervention in psychosis by providing a composite personalised care (CPC) that will enable personalised cognitive training and psychoeducation guidance, adapted to individuals' needs, cognitive abilities and biological background.",

Previous studies have shown that the Hedgehog (Hh) and AKT signaling pathways are activated in a significant proportion of esophageal cancers. Itraconazole, a widely used anti-fungal medication, has been shown to inhibit various pathways involved in esophageal cancer tumorigenesis including Hh and AKT. In this phase II clinical trial, the investigators aim to evaluate the effect of itraconazole as a neoadjuvant therapy following standard of care chemoradiation in the treatment of locoregional esophageal and gastroesophageal junction carcinomas.",
    "detailed_description": "Esophageal cancer has a high incidence rate in the United States, and novel approaches to its treatment are being studied. Itraconazole, an antifungal agent, has been shown to inhibit the Hedgehog (Hh) and AKT signaling pathways, which are upregulated in esophageal cancer and promote tumor cell growth. This study will evaluate whether the use of itraconazole leads to increased rates of pathological complete response (pathCR) by at least 15% from the historical pathCR rate of 25% in patients with esophageal cancer or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. The investigators will enroll approximately 78 patients with esophageal cancer or GEJ adenocarcinoma who will then undergo standard of care staging work-up with a PET/CT and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). In a subset of patients, biopsies will be obtained to assess the status of the Hh and AKT signaling pathways by PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry in the primary tumor before treatment. If no distant metastases are found, all patients will undergo 5-6 weeks of standard of care neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Following this, all patients will be given itraconazole 300 mg twice daily for 6-8 weeks. Adverse effects to itraconazole will be monitored in oncology clinic. If standard restaging PET/CT following neoadjuvant chemoradiation does not reveal new metastases, the patient will undergo an esophagectomy. Samples from normal esophageal tissue will be analyzed for presence of itraconazole and its metabolites to determine if the patients were taking the study drug. Tumor tissue will be evaluated for status of Hh pathway activation, AKT and VEGFR2 phosphorylation, Ki67 immunostaining, and other molecular pathways with comparisons made to pre-treatment biopsies if available. The final pathology report will indicate whether the patient has achieved pathCR. Because the Hh signaling pathway is a resistance pathway that can be upregulated in response to chemoradiation, the investigators believe that administering itraconazole following neoadjuvant chemoradiation will lead to a higher pathCR rate. This in turn should be able to improve treatment outcomes in patients with esophageal cancer and GEJ adenocarcinoma.",

    "detailed_description": "CAPA-IVM (In Vitro Maturation) technology is an assisted reproductive method offering significant benefits in terms of safety and treatment costs, particularly for high-risk patients. These include individuals with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), venous thrombosis, ovarian torsion, or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) - who typically present with a high number of antral follicles (constituting nearly 15% of all patients). Although the live birth rate following the first transfer in the CAPA-IVM group is 35.2%, which is not statistically different from the conventional IVF group at 43.2% (risk difference: -8.1%; 95% confidence interval: -16.6% to 0.5%), the number of good-quality embryos per cycle and the cumulative clinical pregnancy rate remain lower than in conventional IVF. Therefore, improving the CAPA-IVM culture process to achieve the optimal number and quality of oocytes is essential.\n\nConcurrently, adding growth factors commonly found in follicular fluid to the culture medium represents a remarkable advancement in improving oocyte quality in CAPA-IVM. Some somatic compartments, such as expansion, metabolism, and apoptosis, are regulated by soluble growth factors, known as oocyte secretion factors (OSFs). Two OSFs, Growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) and Bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP15), have been identified as critical for follicular development and fertility in various species such as mice, sheep, and humans. During IVM culture, both the immature and mature forms of these factors as well as their homo- and heterodimer structures have been tested. Notably, the heterodimer structure has shown the most positive effects on cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) during IVM culture.\n\nAlthough both growth factors exist in homodimeric forms, recent studies have found that the GDF9 and BMP15 heterodimer can also form a more potent growth factor called cumulin. BMP15 activates latent GDF9 in cumulin, leading to strong signaling in granulosa cells via type I receptors (ALK4/5) and SMAD2/3 transcription factors. Biomedically engineered cumulin has been proposed to noticeably improve embryo outcomes in mouse and porcine models. Recently, a modified version of wild-type GDF9, called super GDF9, has been demonstrated to be \\>1000 times more potent than GDF9 and 4 times more activity than cumulin in SMAD2/3-responsive transcriptional assays in granulosa cells. Previous research has illustrated that adding super GDF9 to CAPA-IVM media in mice induces gene expression in the ovulatory cascade during CAPA-IVM maturation that closely resembles in vivo maturation. Super GDF9 effectively promotes cumulus cell expansion and enhances oocyte developmental competence in vitro. Hence, super GDF9 can potentially replace cumulin, which faces challenges in production and purification.\n\nThis study investigates the impact of supplementing super GDF9 during CAPA-IVM culture, aiming to improve outcomes of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) from small follicles and ultimately enhance treatment success.\n\nThis study will recruit 300 COCs (an estimated 10 needed patients). 100 COCs will be allocated to the research arm (sGDF-9), while 200 COCs will be allocated to the control arm.\n\n* Screening for eligibility\n\n  * This study will be conducted at My Duc Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.\n  * Women who are potentially eligible will be provided information about the study at the time of IVM treatment indication.\n  * Screening for eligibility will be performed on the day of the first visit when the IVM treatment is indicated.\n  * Patients will be provided information about the study and informed consent documents. The investigators will obtain signed informed consent forms from all women before enrollment.\n  * Eligible women will be scheduled to undergo oocyte pick-up procedures within 1-7 days from informed consent.\n* Oocytes retrieval The oocyte pick-up procedure will be conducted according to the center's standard practices for CAPA-IVM cycles.\n\nCumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) from small follicles after OPU will be divided into 2 groups:\n\n* Group 1 (sGDF-9): donated COCs will be cultured in the CAPA and IVM steps, adding 50ng/ml Super-GDF9 during both steps in CAPA-IVM\n* Group 2 (Control): The subject's remaining COCs will be cultured in the CAPA and IVM steps without adding Super-GDF9 during CAPA-IVM.\n\nGroups 1 and 2: Collecting after the capacitation step: spent media and blank wells. Collecting after the maturation step: spent media, cumulus cell, and blank wells.\n\n+ CAPA and Maturation culture: CAPA and Maturation culture will be performed routinely following current laboratory protocols.

It is not known why this is, but changes in the serotonergic brain system might play a role. Intriguingly, in cross-sectional work, the investigators have demonstrated a lower level of the serotonin 4 receptor globally in the brain of healthy women using oral contraceptives compared to non-users. The order of magnitude of this difference is comparable to what has been observed in depressed individuals relative to healthy controls. In this study, the investigators will apply a longitudinal design to determine if starting on oral contraceptives induces a reduction in the serotonin 4 receptor in healthy women and whether such changes are related to potential changes in measures of cognition as well as mood/affect and sexual desire.\n\nThe study is a single-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial with a 3-month intervention paradigm of either Femicept (2nd generation combined oral contraceptive) or placebo. The investigators will include participants until 20 women have completed the study in each arm. Participants will go through an investigational program, including PET and MR brain scans and neuropsychological testing, before starting on the treatment and again during the third pill cycle. To capture changes in mood/ and sexual desire, the participants will complete daily questionnaires during the baseline menstrual cycle and during third pill cycle.\n\nA linear latent variable model will be used to evaluate if OC use induces changes in the serotonin 4 receptor level and such changes will be correlated to changes in secondary outcomes (i.e., cognitive and psychometric measures).",

In addition, the use of OCs has also been linked to reduced sexual desire and interest, one of the common symptoms in depressive disorder. It is unknown why OCs can trigger a depressive episode, at least in a subgroup of women, or how this subgroup at high-risk may be identified in advance.\n\nOCs act by suppressing the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal hormonal axis, which drives the reproductive system, resulting in downregulated sex hormones. Such changes in sex-steroid milieu shape human brain biology and function including serotonergic neurotransmission, which is key in maintaining mental health, including regulation of sexual desire. Preliminary and independent data from the Center for Integrated Molecular Brain Imaging (Cimbi) database, strongly suggest that healthy women who use OCs differ in terms of serotonergic brain architecture. In particular when using a potential marker of brain serotonergic function, the investigators have in a cross-sectional study shown, that OC users display lower serotonin 4 receptor (5-HT4R) brain binding relative to non-users. This difference is remarkably large and comparable to what is seen in depressed individuals compared to in healthy controls and to the effects provoked by pharmacological tools as traditional antidepressant drugs (SSRI). The 5-HT4R is relevant in the context of depression, since rodent work points to a fast-acting antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effect of 5-HT4R stimulation and also, notably, 5-HT4R activation is implicated in behavioral and neurogenic effects of SSRIs. Therefore, a lowered 5HT4R agonism capacity in OC users would offer a plausible explanation for why OC use may provoke depressive symptoms.\n\nThe initial cross-sectional observation of a difference in 5-HT4R binding between OC users and non-users warrants replication and validation in an independent dataset and in a study design where causality can be inferred. With this study, the investigators apply longitudinal study design to determine if OC use versus placebo cause changes in 5-HT4R brain binding and if such changes map onto relevant signatures of brain functions and mental states, including sexual desire. The investigators anticipate that this work will substantially advance the understanding of how changes in sex-hormone milieu increase susceptibility for manifest depressive episodes and ideally provide novel preventive and therapeutic opportunities.\n\nStudy design:\n\nThe investigators will conduct a single-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial with a 3-month intervention paradigm of either OC or placebo. The investigators will include up to 50 healthy women (until 20 women have completed in each arm) at 18-22 years of age. The participants will be allocated to receive a 2nd generation OC (Femicept) or placebo for three pill cycles of 28 days. The participants will undergo an investigational program at baseline (before treatment allocation) and at follow-up (at a specific time in the third pill cycle dependent on treatment arm). The programs consist of 11C-SB207145 PET and MRI/fMRI scan of the brain, neuropsychological testing, collection of blood and saliva samples, completion of questionnaires regarding various trait- and state-related measures including a month at baseline and follow-up of daily questionnaires measuring psychometrics of mood/affect, sexual desire and sleep quality. The participants will be instructed to contact us by e-mail every time they have their first cycle day, i.e. first day of bleeding, during the study, which will be used to estimate menstrual cycle phases.\n\nRandomization:\n\nParticipants will be randomized in random block sizes to either Femicept or placebo. The randomization will be carried out by an administrative staff member at Neurobiology Research Unit (Rigshospitalet, Denmark), who will not otherwise be involved in the study or enrollment. The sequence generation will be created via the online service, Sealed EnvelopeTM (www.sealedenvelope.com). Region Hovedstadens Apotek will carry out allocation concealment by sequentially numbered containers. Enrollment and intervention assignment will be carried out by the clinical investigators. The assignment to active or placebo treatment will happen after the baseline assessment. The investigators will be unblinded after a certain time after allocation so they will be able to plan the follow-up investigational program. To evaluate the efficacy of blinding, participants will be asked which group they believed they belonged to prior to unblinding.\n\nIntervention:\n\nFemicept (CampusPharma) is a monophasic 2nd generation combined OC, the recommended type of combined OC due to the lower thromboembolic risk and it is the most used combined OC in Denmark (www.medstat.dk). One packet consists of 21 active pills, containing 150 micrograms levonorgestrel and 30 microgram ethinylestradiol. One pill is taken every day approximately at the same time of the day (with no more than 12 hours variation) for 21 days. Normally, this will be followed by 7 days off the pill before starting on a new pill cycle, however, to decrease complexity and to increase compliance and the timing of pill cycles, a 7-day regime with placebo pills will be added, during which participants will experience withdrawal bleeding. The placebo pill cycle treatment constitutes 28 days with a daily placebo pill.\n\nEvaluation of compliance:\n\nPill count will be carried out at every pill cycle and plasma estradiol and progesterone will be measured during pill cycle day 18-28 to capture non-compliance based on non-suppressed endogenous ovarian hormone levels indicating if ovulation had occurred. If the participants have missed more than two pills during a pill cycle or if plasma sex steroid levels indicate non-compliance during a pill cycle, it is allowed to extend the treatment with one or two more pill cycles before follow-up, hence, for some participants the intervention may last 4-5 months.\n\nStatistical analysis plan:\n\nThe investigators will use linear latent variable models on log-transformed 5-HT4R binding potentials to estimate the multiplicative group effect of OC use (i.e., the percentage change from baseline in 5-HT4R binding potentials) in the regions of interest (neocortex, neostriatum, and the hippocampus) and compare it between the groups. The log-transformed binding potentials will be adjusted for the injected tracer mass per kg body weight. The investigators will compute model diagnostics by using score tests to detect model misspecifications and add parameters until no misspecification can be detected.\n\nCorrelation analyses will be used to investigate the association between changes in 5-HT4R binding potentials and secondary outcome measures; affect and sexual desire scores, reward fMRI BOLD signals and verbal memory performances. Mediation analysis will be conducted to test the relation between OC-induced changes in 5-HT4R binding potential and the cortisol awakening response (CAR).\n\nFurther, in an explorative approach, the investigators will conduct pooled analyses of baseline data (both OC and placebo group) and potential coupling between baseline imaging outcomes and behavioral outcomes will be performed. Also, analyses of psychometric variations potentially mapping onto menstrual cycle phases will be performed.\n\nSample size calculation:\n\nCalculations based on intra-subject variability of the 5-HT4R binding on 16 subjects with scan-rescan show that a group size of 20 is required to detect 8-11% difference in 5-HT4R BPND in the region of interest (neostriatum, neocortex, and hippocampus) between OC- and placebo group from baseline to follow-up with a power of 0.8 and a significance level of 0.05 (two-sided). This is equivalent to the effect size seen in the cross-sectional finding for these regions. For the primary analyses, only participants with 5-HT4R follow-up data will be included. Missing data as well as dropouts will be reported in the relevant publications. Dropouts with baseline data can be included in the explorative pooled analyses of the baseline data.\n\nHypotheses\n\nPrimary hypothesis:\n\n1. OC use reduces neostriatal, neocortical, and hippocampal 5-HT4R brain binding from baseline relative to placebo.\n\n   Secondary hypotheses:\n2. OC use induces a reduction in positive affect and day to day positive affect variability possibly in a manner dependent on the magnitude of 5-HT4R binding decrease in OC users.\n3. OC use induces mood disturbance and lower day to day mood disturbance variability possibly in a manner dependent on the magnitude of 5-HT4R binding decrease in OC users.\n4. OC use induces a reduction in sexual desire and day to day sexual desire variability in a manner dependent on the magnitude of 5-HT4R binding decrease in OC users.\n5. OC use reduces brain circuit responses to reward stimuli compared to placebo in ventral striatum in a manner dependent on the magnitude of 5-HT4R binding changes.\n6. OC use changes resting state functional connectivity brain networks compared to placebo.\n7. OC use results in reduced gray matter volumes of the hippocampus.\n8. OC use changes white matter integrity.\n9. OC use induces a blunted cortisol awakening response (CAR) possibly in a manner dependent on the magnitude of change in 5-HT4R binding and/or changes in hippocampal volume from baseline.\n10. The association between 5-HT4R binding and verbal memory performance is dependent on OC use status, such that lower 5-HT4R binding is associated with worse verbal memory performance in the OC use state in contrast to better performance in non-OC use state.\n11. OC use results in a bias in processing of emotional information compared to placebo.\n12. OC use reduces sleep quality.\n13. Within the OC users, the estradiol and/or allopregnanolone levels are associated with the 5-HT4R level, working memory performance, cortisol dynamics and hippocampal volume.\n14. OC use induces changes in gene transcript and/or DNA methylation profiles compared to placebo.\n15. OC use increases anxiety in a manner dependent on the magnitude of change in 5-HT4R binding.\n\nEthical considerations:\n\n* Side effects to the intervention: The side effect of most concern is thromboembolic events. However, this risk is only increased from about 1 to 3 per 10.000 women when using 2nd generation OCs, or even less due to the exclusion of those with thromboembolic risk factors, hence it is considered a relatively small risk and acceptable. Further, the blinding of the treatment also raises an ethical concern regarding the risk of pregnancy; even though participants are unaware if they are on OCs or not, they may behave less carefully in regards to preventing pregnancy. To address this, participants will be thoroughly informed to use protection during intercourse and will be offered condoms for free during the study period.\n* Exposure to radioactivity during the PET scans: The total exposure will not exceed 10 mSv equal to 3 years of natural background radiation in Denmark, which should be seen in the light of the new knowledge this study can generate.\n\nThe study will be conducted in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki.",

    "detailed_description": "Study Purpose: Background and Significance Trans-axillary and trans-breast endoscopic thyroid surgery is currently the most widely used and recognized minimally invasive cosmetic thyroid surgery method. However, due to its inherent characteristics, this approach still has certain limitations that require further improvement. For example, there have been no studies reporting the short-term and long-term advantages of not suturing the cervical white line during trans-breast endoscopic thyroid surgery. Through theoretical analysis, it is suggested that not suturing the cervical white line during endoscopic thyroid surgery might be safe and feasible in terms of reducing operation time, postoperative pain, and incision complications, but this needs to be further verified.\n\nThe mechanisms underlying the occurrence, progression, metastasis, and recurrence of thyroid cancer are still not completely understood, necessitating further basic and clinically relevant research using clinical specimens.\n\nCombining the current research progress domestically and internationally, the purpose of this study is to explore the clinical outcomes of improved surgical methods, such as not suturing the cervical white line during trans-axillary and trans-breast endoscopic thyroidectomy. In addition, the study aims to collect normal thyroid tissue, benign and malignant thyroid tumors, and lymph nodes to further elucidate the mechanisms related to the occurrence, progression, metastasis, and recurrence of thyroid cancer.\n\nStudy Procedure Before you are enrolled in the study, the doctor will conduct a detailed inquiry and record your medical history.

    "detailed_description": "This proposal will address 3 main aims: 1) Determine the impact of endogenous AT circadian rhythms on AT function independent of diurnal nutrient delivery in humans, 2) determine the impact of central obesity on adipocyte circadian clock, and 3) establish for the first-time in vivo human adipocyte specific cistrome of the core circadian clock transcription factors, BMAL1 and CLOCK. In order to understand whether adipocytes have intrinsic circadian clock entrainment that is separate from food entrainment, we will compare rhythmicity of AT of lean volunteers studied under continuous vs. intermittent feeding paradigms. 20 normal weight adults (M/F= 10/10, split evenly between feeding groups) will be randomized to receive either \"continuous\" (CONT) feedings via a nasogastric (NG) feeding tube or receive 3 meals a day for the \"intermittent\" (INTER) study, also delivered via NG tube. The screening prior to the inpatient study visit will include vital signs, height, weight, hip/waist/neck circumference, body composition (DEXA scan) plasma lipid profile and fasting glucose. Potential volunteers will fill out questionnaires to exclude sleep disorders and assure normal sleep habits. For 3 days prior to and during the inpatient study, volunteers will be required to wear an Actiwatch 24 h/day; which objectively measures 24-hour sleep quality and quantity. (see detailed methodology).\n\nFor the inpatient visit, volunteers will be admitted to Mayo Clinic Clinical Research and Trials Unit (CRTU) at 1500 h where an NG tube will be placed. After baseline blood samples, the CONT feeding group will start liquid feedings (Ensure Plus\u00ae) at 1800 and continue for the next \\~37 hrs. This will provide 12 h of continuous feeding before the first abdominal AT biopsies; this duration of continuous feeding abolishes the wide fluctuations in plasma insulin that occurs with normal meals and will avoid the progressive lipolytic response that would occur if fasting were used as the experimental design. FFA during isocaloric, continuous feeding is well within normal intraday variability. Participants randomized to INTER will receive 1/3rd of their daily energy needs at each \"meal\" via NG tube. These feedings will be given at 1800 h and 3 separate meals the following day. Participants will undergo measures of resting energy expenditure following the overnight period to appropriately interpret FFA Ra data.\n\nTo avoid retrieving AT sample from previously disrupted biopsy sites, every participant will be limited to 4 abdominal adipose tissue biopsies (1 per abdominal quadrant). To ensure a full 24 hours of data, all participants will have biopsies at: 0600, 1800, and 0600 the next day, half of participants will have a biopsy at 1200 and the other half at 2400. This hybrid (linked-cross sectional) will allow us to sample in series from multiple people and then create sample group means to account for disparate biopsy numbers. We are sampling from abdominal adipose tissue as this is the primary source of circulating FFA in humans and thus is the most likely for us to ascertain regulation of lipolysis proteins.",

    "brief_summary": "Although several studies have revealed signaling pathways as well as genes potentially involved in the development of esophageal atresia (EA), our understanding of the pathophysiology of EA lags behind improvements in the surgical and clinical care of patients born with this anomaly. However, a causative genetic abnormality can be identified in less than 10% of patients, even using more recent next-generation sequencing techniques. As most cases of EA associated with tracheoesophageal fistula (TOF) are sporadic, and the familial recurrence rate is low (1%), this suggests that epigenetic and environmental factors also contribute to the disease. Further investigations are needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying EA. That information can come from the oesophageal biopsies that are collected in routine care and long-term storage at the hospital. However, the impact of the length of the storage is still unknown.",

    "brief_summary": "This phase III trial tests how well the addition of dinutuximab to Induction chemotherapy along with standard of care surgical resection of the primary tumor, radiation, stem cell transplantation, and immunotherapy works for treating children with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma. Dinutuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called GD2, which is found on the surface of neuroblastoma cells, but is not present on many healthy or normal cells in the body. When dinutuximab binds to the neuroblastoma cells, it helps signal the immune system to kill the tumor cells. This helps the cells of the immune system kill the cancer cells, this is a type of immunotherapy. When chemotherapy and immunotherapy are given together, during the same treatment cycle, it is called chemoimmunotherapy. This clinical trial randomly assigns patients to receive either standard chemotherapy and surgery or chemoimmunotherapy (chemotherapy plus dinutuximab) and surgery during Induction therapy. Chemotherapy drugs administered during Induction include, cyclophosphamide, topotecan, cisplatin, etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin. These drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing or by stopping them from spreading. Upon completion of 5 cycles of Induction therapy, a disease evaluation is completed to determine how well the treatment worked. If the tumor responds to therapy, patients receive a tandem transplantation with stem cell rescue. If the tumor has little improvement or worsens, patients receive chemoimmunotherapy on Extended Induction. During Extended Induction, dinutuximab is given with irinotecan, temozolomide. Patients with a good response to therapy move on to Consolidation therapy, when very high doses of chemotherapy are given at two separate points to kill any remaining cancer cells. Following, transplant, radiation therapy is given to the site where the cancer originated (primary site) and to any other areas that are still active at the end of Induction. The final stage of therapy is Post-Consolidation. During Post-Consolidation, dinutuximab is given with isotretinoin, with the goal of maintaining the response achieved with the previous therapy. Adding dinutuximab to Induction chemotherapy along with standard of care surgical resection of the primary tumor, radiation, stem cell transplantation, and immunotherapy may be better at treating children with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma.",

Yet, up to date, whether EVOO protects against AD in individuals with a family history of AD is unknown. Thus, in this study, the investigators will recruit healthy individuals with a family history of AD for participation. From eligible participants, blood samples for ApoE genotyping will be collected, followed by metabolomics, lipidomics, and transcriptomics analyses at baseline. Participants will be randomized into 2 groups (n=20 each); one group will receive EVOO daily (\\~2 tablespoons, 30 ml) for 6 months, and the second group will not receive olive oil. Both group participants will receive educational information on brain health and how environmental factors such as lifestyle, diet, and exercise could impact brain health. After 6 months, another blood sample will be collected from the participants to evaluate the effect of EVOO on metabolites, lipids, and genes, and thus physiological pathways. The investigators will perform non-targeted and comprehensive metabolomics, lipidomics, and transcriptomics analyses. Examples of metabolites to be analyzed are antioxidative and anti-inflammatory metabolites, neurotransmission, mitochondrial, tryptophan, and purine metabolisms. Examples of lipidomics include sphingomyelins (SMs), cholesterol esters (ChEs), phosphatidylcholines (PCs), phosphatidylethanolamines (PIs), phosphatidylinositols (PIs), and triglycerides (TGs). Transcriptomics will be used to identify changes in mRNAs involved in different pathways contributing to AD, such as genes involved in inflammation and oxidative stress, in both ApoE-dependent and independent fashion.",
    "detailed_description": "Several epidemiological and clinical studies proposed that adherence to the Mediterranean diet improves cognitive function and slows Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is one of the main elements of the Mediterranean diet. EVOO provides several health benefits, including strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Findings from our preclinical published studies support the consumption of EVOO to protect the brain, prevent AD and delay disease progression. In addition, findings from the investigators' pilot clinical trial in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) individuals demonstrated EVOO improved cerebrovascular function and memory. However, the remaining question is whether EVOO could protect individuals from AD in individuals with a family history of AD, i.e., with a genetic predisposition. One of the major risk factors for AD is the genetic variation in apolipoprotein E (ApoE). ApoE is a major risk factor for developing late-onset AD, with ApoE4 being detrimental and ApoE2 protective. Compared to the most common ApoE3/3 genotype, each additional copy of the ApoE4 allele is associated with an increased risk of AD and a younger mean age at dementia onset, such that ApoE4 homozygotes are at the highest risk. Available reports have shown ApoE4 carriers have increased amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) brain levels contributing to its accumulation and related pathology. Also, ApoE4 contributes to cerebrovascular dysfunction, increasing susceptibility to neurodegenerative insult. Besides, compared to ApoE3, ApoE4 carriers may not respond to some drugs suggesting the efficacy is ApoE genotype dependent. However, whether EVOO protective effect could extend to those with a family history of AD, i.e., with a genetic predisposition, specifically ApoE4, is unknown. Thus, the objectives of this study are: 1) To evaluate the effect of EVOO on molecular and biological pathways linked with AD by monitoring changes in blood metabolites (metabolomics), lipids (lipidomics), and genes (transcriptomics); and 2): To compare the effect of EVOO on analyzed pathways between individuals with ApoE3 and ApoE4. To accomplish both specific aims, the investigators will recruit healthy individuals with a family history of AD for participation. At baseline, blood samples will be collected from eligible participants for ApoE genotyping and metabolomics, lipidomics, and transcriptomics analyses. Participants will be randomized into 2 groups (n=20 each); one group will receive daily EVOO (\\~2 tablespoons, 30 ml per day) for 6 months, and the second group will not receive olive oil.

Measure NAD+ and NADH levels in the blood and myocardium of the participants.\n2. Assess mitochondrial morphology and function in cardiac tissue using electron microscopy (EM) and isolated mitochondria.\n3.

Life-long insulin therapy is the major treatment option. However, insulin therapy is not a cure and a safer and more effective therapy is needed.\n\nMesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) have emerged as a novel biopharmaceutical approach for many disorders. MSCs are a cellular product that can be derived from a patient's own body (autologous) or from a donor (allogeneic). This study will obtain MSCs from umbilical cords at the time of delivery from normal women who have been extensively screened for infectious diseases. These cells produced at the MUSC Center for Cellular therapy will be used within 3 passages after collection.\n\nEvidence from animal models and clinical trials suggests that MSC infusion suppresses autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as T1D. One clear message from these trials is that MSCs are effective at suppressing autoimmunity and seem generally safe. This study will measure safety and efficacy of MSCs over the course of 1 year.",

    "detailed_description": "Background: The accrual of population immunity to COVID-19 could allow life to return to pre- pandemic normality. Immunity can be acquired through natural infections or, preferably, by vaccination. An unprecedented global effort has succeeded in developing a number of COVID-19 vaccines. All vaccines against COVID-19 approved until now have originally been developed as either a single dose or following a homologous two-dose regimen. Inactivated COVID-19 vaccines have shown inferior immunogenicity compared to mRNA vaccines but there are no studies comparing the advantages of alternative booster doses in individuals who have previously received two doses of an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine or two doses of an mRNA vaccine.\n\nAims and primary objectives: The aims of this study are: (1) to compare the SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses to one dose of BNT162b2 (mRNA vaccine, Fosun/BioNTech) versus one dose of CoronaVac (inactivated vaccine, Sinovac) in individuals who have previously received two doses of COVID-19 vaccination using BNT162b2 (mRNA vaccine, Fosun/BioNTech) or CoronaVac (inactivated vaccine, Sinovac), and (2) to assess the reactogenicity and safety of one booster dose of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac. The specific primary objective of our study is to assess the vaccine (humoral) immunogenicity, proxied by SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing antibody titers, of one booster dose of BNT162b2 or CoronaVac at 28 days after the booster dose in individuals who have previously received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nStudy design: Randomized open label trial in adults aged 18 years of age or older (at enrolment). The duration of participation for each participant will be 12 months from the administration of the vaccination booster dose. The immune response and reactogenicity of one dose of BNT162b2 or CoronaVac will be investigated in individuals who previously received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine at least 6 months earlier. Participants will be enrolled shortly before receiving the booster dose of BNT162b2 (day 0), with blood collection at days 0, 28, 182 and 365 days after enrolment for analysis of humoral immune responses. A subset of 25% of participants will provide additional blood samples at day 0, 7 and 30 for assessment of cellular immune responses.\n\nMain outcomes: The primary outcome is the vaccine (humoral) immunogenicity measured as SARS- CoV-2 serum neutralizing antibodies, evaluated as the geometric mean titer (GMT) at 28 days after the booster doses. The secondary outcomes include (1) a comparison of SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing antibodies as the geometric mean fold rise from baseline to each post-vaccination timepoint (i.e. at days 28, 182 and 365); (2) a comparison of cellular immune responses at day 7 and 30 compared to day 0; (3) descriptive analysis of the reactogenicity and safety profiles of the booster doses.\n\nTarget population: Adults aged 18 years or older\n\nNumber of subjects planned: 400 participants to be recruited in 2021-22\n\nStudy Duration: 12 months, from September 2021 through to March 2023\n\nPotential implications: This study will provide important evidence into the comparative effects of using a dose of mRNA vaccine or inactivated vaccine to boost the immune response in individuals that had previously received two doses of COVID-19 vaccination. This information together with data collected on reactogenicity and safety could inform COVID-19 vaccination policy locally and internationally.",

    "detailed_description": "People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are disproportionately affected by cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD is a leading cause of death in T1D, contributing to 40% of mortality. Sleep is recognized by both the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association as a critical health behavior to maintain glycemic control and reduce CVD risk. Short and/or irregular sleep have been associated with reduced glycemic control and non-dipping blood pressure in T1D, both of which are predictors of CV events. Emerging data suggest that behavioral sleep interventions targeting short or irregular sleep led to improved glycemic parameters. However, little is known about the mechanism by which improving sleep duration and/or regularity improves glycemic control and reduces CV risk in T1D. The investigators and others have shown that people with T1D often experience poor sleep health, including inadequate sleep duration, sleep irregularity, and poor sleep quality. The goals of this study are to examine the mechanisms by which improving sleep regularity through behavioral sleep intervention affects glycemic control and CVD risks in T1D adults. The investigators propose to extend our previous research by conducting a mechanistic study using a sleep stability manipulation. The investigators hypothesize that sleep stability impacts glycemic control and CV outcomes by improving circadian regulation. The investigators will conduct a 4-week behavioral sleep stability intervention in 80 T1D adults with irregular sleep, utilizing a sleep pre/post design. Circadian regulation will be assessed by dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO), melatonin metabolite amplitude (overnight urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels), actigraphy-derived rest-activity rhythm, endothelial cell CLOCK gene mRNA expression, and known zeitgebers of the central and peripheral circadian clocks (light exposure, meal timing). Main glycemic outcomes will be assessed by CGM, A1C, and assessment of insulin sensitivity. Main CV outcomes will include 24h blood pressure and endothelial FMD and other secondary vascular measures (pulse wave velocity, carotid intima media thickness, and echocardiographic parameters). Sleep will be objectively recorded. All parameters will be measured at baseline and end of intervention. This proposal will advance the understanding of mechanisms by which improving sleep regularity influences glycemic control and cardiovascular risk in T1D.",

    "brief_summary": "Childhood adversity affects almost two-thirds of the US population, is a major risk factor for the leading causes of disease and increases US economic health burdens. Childhood adversity also alters biologic systems, such as the oxytocin hormone, that can affect attachment behavior. This innovative study has the potential to advance science and improve mother-infant interaction by testing an early life, home-based, multisensory behavioral intervention (called ATVV), targeting the oxytocin system, to promote synchronous early mother-infant interaction, especially critical for mothers who have experienced childhood adversity.\n\nThis two-group randomized clinical trial will test the ATVV's effect on oxytocin system function and quality of mother-infant interaction. The investigators will enroll 250 first-time healthy mothers carrying a single baby who have a history of childhood adversity, and obtain baseline data in their third trimester of pregnancy. Soon after birth (before hospital discharge), mothers (and babies) who continue to be eligible are randomized into the intervention group and taught to give ATVV daily for 3 months, or randomized into the Attention Control education group and taught safe infant care. After birth, the investigators check-in frequently with mothers through weekly phone calls. There are 3 study visits at 1, 2 and 3 months after birth that include survey questions and collection of maternal blood and infant saliva. Mothers and babies are also video-recorded at 3 months after birth for 4 minutes to assess mother-infant interaction. The investigators follow-up with a phone call at 6 months after birth.\n\nWhile both groups will benefit from the content and attention the investigators give mothers, the investigators hypothesize that, compared to the education group, mothers and infants in the intervention group will have improved oxytocin system function and more synchronous mother-infant interaction.",
    "detailed_description": "Childhood adversity (e.g., abuse, neglect, or household dysfunction), is a common experience significantly contributing to the leading causes of death and increased US economic health burdens. Childhood adversity causes long-term alterations on the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems well into adulthood, including dampening of the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT). A healthy OXT system facilitates responsive social engagement and promotes maternal-infant (M-I) synchrony (reciprocal gaze, affect speech, and touch). Optimal M-I synchrony fuels early brain development and prevents low empathy, disruptive behavior, poor social adaptation, cognitive deficits, and psychopathology in children. The investigators posit that mothers with childhood adversity will have more difficulty with M-I synchrony, due in part to a dampened OXT system, and will benefit from interventions that improve responsive, nurturing, engagement by epigenetic regulation of the OXT system. Most interventions are costly, complex, and time-consuming. The investigators aim to fill this gap by testing whether a simple early behavioral intervention (ATVV) will improve OXT system function and M-I synchrony in mothers with childhood adversity.\n\nThe ATVV (Auditory, Tactile, Visual, Vestibular) is a 15-minute behavioral intervention that is a multisensory infant massage contingent on infant cues. The investigators extend the known success of ATVV with preterm infants to full-term infants. The investigators will compare M-I synchrony at 3 postnatal months in 250 first-time mothers (and their full-term infants) randomized to apply ATVV daily from birth to 3 months (n =125) or receive infant care education in an attention control group (n = 125). The investigators apply a rigorous measure of M-I synchrony that micro-codes video-recorded M-I behavior quantifying shared gaze, affect, speech, and touch. Coding requires only 3-minutes of interaction and is valid when infants can reliably interact starting by 3 months of age. The investigators will also assess ATVV's effect on maternal and infant peripheral OXT level, a known biomarker of M-I synchrony. OXT levels relate to quality of M-I synchrony, yet the investigators extend this knowledge to identify an epigenetic role of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR). The investigators will analyze maternal plasma for OXTR methylation, OXTR gene expression, OXTR protein, and oxytocin peptide in pregnancy, and at 1, 2, and 3 postnatal months (along with infant saliva OXT).\n\nThe investigators propose a single-site, randomized, two-group, attention-controlled clinical trial (N=250 M-I dyads) to test the efficacy of the ATVV multisensory behavioral intervention to improve OXT system function and M-I synchrony. Adult, nulliparous, English or Spanish speaking women carrying a single fetus, and scoring 2 or higher on the Adverse Childhood Experiences scale will be enrolled. The investigators will obtain baseline OXT, demographics and survey data in the third trimester. Soon after birth (pre-hospital discharge), M-I dyads who continue to be eligible (e.g., full-term gestation) are randomized into the intervention group (n = 125) and taught to administer ATVV daily for 3 months or randomized into the Attention Control group (n = 125) and taught normal safe infant care. There are postnatal study visits at 1, 2 and 3 months. The investigators follow-up with a phone call at 6 postnatal months (3-months after the intervention period ends) to assess self-report parenting behavior (a proxy for quality of M-I interaction) that the investigators also measure at postnatal months 1, 2, and 3.\n\nAim 1: Evaluate the efficacy of daily ATVV over 3 postnatal months among mothers with childhood adversity. The investigators hypothesize that compared to the Attention Control group (n=125), M-I dyads in the ATVV group (n=125) will exhibit:\n\nH1: Higher oxytocin function (i.e., decreased OXTR methylation at candidate sites, and increased OXTR messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), OXTR protein, and OXT in maternal plasma, and increased OXT in infant saliva) at 1, 2, and 3 postnatal months.\n\nH2: More synchronous eye-to-eye gaze \\[primary\\], positive affect \\[primary\\], speech, and touch at 3 postnatal months.\n\nAim 2: Identify molecular mechanisms in the OXT system underlying M-I synchrony (N=250).\n\nH1: Lower M-I synchrony will be associated with dampening of the OXT system, evidenced by increased OXTR methylation at candidate sites, and decreased OXTR mRNA, OXTR protein, and OXT in maternal plasma, and decreased OXT in infant saliva at 3-postnatal months.\n\nRegression based methods (including covariates) will assess ATVV effects on M-I synchrony and OXT measures, and identify relations among M-I synchrony and oxytocin measures. Clustering methods will be used to discover molecular profiles. An early behavioral intervention that successfully promotes M-I synchrony in vulnerable women through epigenetic regulation of the OXT system can then be tested in a multi-site clinical implementation trial with other high-risk groups.\n\nProtocol: The Recruiter will introduce the study to potentially eligible pregnant women. Eligible women who are interested in joining will be consented and scheduled for a 3rd trimester baseline study visit at the university. The investigators will draw blood for OXT measures, and collect data in REDCap on demographics, maternal characteristics, and self-report surveys. Research team members will keep track of when participants have given birth and meet them in a study site hospital before discharged. The investigators will collect data on mother and infant health, birth events, and other covariates. At the hospital visit, women are randomly assigned to either the ATVV group and taught how to administer the intervention on a daily basis, or are randomly assigned to the Attention Control group and taught safe infant newborn care.\n\nAll participants will receive daily texts to measure daily stress, and intervention participants also document frequency of the intervention. Using Participatory Guidance to address women's needs, the investigators will call women each week after birth for a check-in. In the intervention group, any challenges with the intervention will be discussed and problem-solved. In the Attention Control group, age-appropriate safe infant care will be discussed.\n\nAfter the hospital visit, monthly study visits at 1, 2, and 3 months include collecting maternal blood and infant saliva, and self-report surveys in REDCap. Women will either complete REDCap surveys online before each visit, or complete them at the study visit. To check intervention fidelity, mothers in the ATVV group demonstrate how they perform the intervention with their infant. The team member instructs mothers how to adapt the ATVV to their maturing infant and discuss any challenges with the intervention. Mothers in the Attention Control group are taught age-appropriate safe infant care.\n\nAt the 3rd month study visit, the investigators collect behavioral outcome data on M-I synchrony. All M-I dyads will be video recorded freely interacting with each other for 4 minutes (coding occurs on the last 3 minutes). Video recording occurs when the infant is alert and ready to interact, \\> 30 minutes after the end of a breastfeeding or formula feeding, and data collection order may be adjusted if the baby is sleepy or fussy. Interactions are micro-coded frame by frame on a computerized system (Noldus, Wageningen, The Netherlands), consistent with previous research on parent-infant synchrony. Coders, blinded to group assignment, are trained to 90% inter-rater reliability. Our last interaction with participants is a phone call at 6-postnatal months to explore duration of the intervention's effect using the Parenting Stress Index.",

    "detailed_description": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a high prevalence globally and is a global health concern. CKD is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular morbidity, mortality and decreased quality of life in all stages of the disease. Most patients with CKD die of cardiovascular events in earlier stages before end-stage renal disease develops.\n\nFor the last years, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockade agents (ACEi/ARBs) were the only treatment available for managing CKD in both native and kidney transplant patients. Recently, sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) emerged as a new class of therapeutics for diabetic CKD, non-diabetic proteinuric CKD, and heart failure with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in patients with native kidneys.\n\nDapagliflozin (SGLT2i) has been shown to be cardio- and nephroprotective in patients with and without T2DM. The DAPA-CKD trial found that patients with CKD treated with dapagliflozin had a lower risk of the primary composite outcome of a sustained decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes than patients who were assigned to receive placebo. Similar results have been confirmed by other SGLT2i in 2022 (Empagliflozin; EMPA-KIDNEY trial). In April 2021, Dapagliflozin became the first SGLT2i to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) regardless of diabetic status.\n\nThe anti-hyperglycaemic and anti-hypertensive effects of Dapagliflozin have been extensively studied and demonstrated in a number of clinical trials as well as in a real-world care setting. Previously,the investigators have demonstrated treatment with dapagliflozin in patients with T2DM improved diabetic control and reduced blood pressure (BP) in comparison to placebo. Furthermore, the drug was capable of reducing hyperperfusion of retinal capillaries and minimizing arteriole remodelling, factors that contribute to the progression of diabetic retinopathy, known to be linked with diabetic nephropathy. However, the precise mechanisms of its nephroprotective potential are still under discussion and needs to be elucidated.\n\nRecently, the investigators described the intrarenal and glomerular hemodynamics of SGLT2i assessed by the clearance technique. SGLT2-inhibition impacts predominantly on post glomerular site, decreases renal vascular resistance and preserves renal perfusion in patients with type 2 diabetes and, thereby preserve renal function.\n\nVascular, glomerular and tubular effects of SGLT2i are discussed based on experimental and rarely on human data. Since the SGLT2 transporter has a high oxygen demand, relative hypoxia occurs in the renal interstitial tissue, with morphological changes of the fibroblasts (impairing erythropoietin production). In addition, the high glucose milieu in the interstitium also causes increased oxidative stress and triggers inflammatory responses that may cause increased glomerular permeability (despite upregulation of nitric oxide synthesis) and interstitial fibrosis. The aim of this study is to observe the mechanisms of dapagliflozin on the renal interstitial tissue (histology, urinary and serum markers indicative of histological integrity) and renal perfusion. For this purpose, renal transplanted patients as an excellent model of CKD and high cardiovascular risk (similar to patients in DAPA-CKD study) are included in this study. In addition, the investigators obtain clinical data of SGLT2i administered in patients after kidney transplantation.\n\nUp to date the use SGLT2i appear to be safe in patients after renal transplantation based on data from pilot studies. However, renal transplanted patients were not included in the large preapproval randomized placebo-controlled trials. So, treatment with SGLT2i in renal transplanted patients with CKD is not obligatory. Recently, a review has been published summarizing the potential benefits and concerns of these agents in the context of kidney transplantation. In summary, the frequency of reported adverse effects in kidney transplant recipients does not appear to exceed those found in non-transplant patients or in kidney transplant recipients in the absence of SGLT2i therapy. In particular, the incidence of urinary tract infections with SGLT2i were consistent with previously reported incidence rates of the same and there were no reported incidences of Fourier's gangrene.\n\nAlong with the histological parameters, the investigators assess parameters of the renal circulation including total renal perfusion, separate cortical and medullary renal perfusion and renal vascular resistance in this cohort using arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI). Of note, we have demonstrated that renal perfusion assessed by ASL-MRI is valid, plausible and reliable.\n\nSeveral prospective studies reported a closer relation of organ damage with central (aortic) as opposed to peripheral (brachial) systolic blood pressure (BP), and central systolic BP was found to be independently associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In accordance, central pulse pressure has been repeatedly found to independently predict cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in various study cohorts. Further-more, prospective data have now been published showing that the forward and backward (reflected) wave amplitude predict independently cardiovascular complications. New advanced technology allows us to assess different vascular parameters. Previously, the investigators could demonstrate that the SGLT2i empagliflozin and dapagliflozin improved parameters of vascular function and arterial stiffness and decreased central (aortic) pulse and systolic pressures (i.e. afterload of the left ventricle) in patients with T2DM. Our results provided evidence for the concept that the better cardiovascular and renal outcomes observed with dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in the outcome studies are related to improved vascular function. In this study, these parameters are assessed to find out if the above mentioned results can be confirmed in patients after renal transplantation.\n\nOur hypothesis is that dapagliflozin exerts beneficial effects on renal morphology, intrarenal inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with CKD. Moreover, improve vascular parameters and renal perfusion. Our approach would add valuable information for our pathophysiological understanding of the nephroprotective mechanisms of dapagliflozin in patients with CKD. In addition, the investigators obtain clinical data with respect to safety and effectiveness of SGLT2i administered in patients after kidney transplantation.",

    "brief_summary": "It is important people receiving immunosuppressive therapy are provided with the best protection against COVID-19 because they are at greater risk of severe illness should they become infected. As severe immunosuppression can reduce the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination, doctors agree that COVID-19 boosters is are important to maximise the vaccine response in these people. However, we don't currently know the best time to give booster vaccines to people about to start immunosuppressive therapy. This research aims to address this knowledge gap by examining whether the greatest protection is provided by giving the COVID-19 booster just before the immunosuppressive therapy starts or by waiting and giving the booster 6 months after treatment start. At the 6-month timepoint, in many cases the more intensive immunosuppression is often weaning and the immune system is starting to rebuild.",
    "detailed_description": "Current guidelines for SARS-CoV2 vaccination in immunosuppressed populations are based on limited evidence. Additionally, guidelines for the use of SARS-CoV2 vaccines in autoimmune populations are somewhat contradictory, with the 2019 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations including advice to where possible administer booster vaccinations prior to commencing immunosuppression but to preferably vaccinate while the autoimmune disease is not active. In haematological conditions it is suggested that vaccination occur prior to B cell depletion therapies e.g. rituximab, or \\>6 months after its use. While these guidelines were developed for non-live vaccines in general, the evidence for COVID-19 vaccines is almost entirely based on expert opinion. Clearly, with these gaps and inconsistencies in the clinical guidelines there is equipoise for the optimal timing of a booster vaccination. One of the difficulties in this field is the wide diversity of patients receiving a variety of immunosuppressive therapies. We have therefore taken a pragmatic 'real-world' approach in our design by focusing on two broad patient groups that are more specifically stratify based on pre-define disease conditions and specific treatments.\n\nRecent data studying COVID-19 vaccine responses in patients on immunosuppressive therapies for autoimmune/inflammatory conditions demonstrate the greatest compromise in anti-Spike IgG occurs in those receiving combination immunosuppression particularly regimens that include methotrexate and other antimetabolites, and B cell depleting therapies. In patients with haematological malignancies the lowest vaccine responses were seen in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. In patients with a haematological malignancy who have undergone a bone marrow transplant, immunisation to COVID-19 \\<6 months following transplantation resulted in poor IgG response to vaccine, while those immunised \\>6 months post-transplant had superior responses. In contrast, other targeted therapies including the integrin inhibitor vedoluzimab or anti IL-17/23 therapy (in the absence of concurrent methotrexate) have relatively preserved response to the initial vaccine regimen. Given the available data, we propose to study defined populations of two major immunosuppressed patient groups: Group 1): Haematological Malignancy (excluding bone marrow transplant recipients) and Autoimmune/Inflammatory Disease, and Group 2: Autologous and Allogeneic Bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. We will compare the difference between an immediate COVID-19 \"booster\" dose and a deferred COVID-19 \"booster\". In Group 1 \"Immediate\" is defined as prior to the commencement of moderate-to-severe immunosuppression and \"Deferred\" is defined as 6 months post commencement of moderate-to-severe immunosuppression. For Group 2 BMT patients, current national guidelines recommend 3 doses of pre-BMT COVID-19 vaccines followed by 3 doses of post-BMT COVID-19 vaccines initiated 6 months post-BMT. In Group 2 \"Immediate\" is defined as 6 months post-BMT and \"Deferred\" as \\>12 months post-BMT.\n\nThe primary endpoint will be the integrated area under the curve (AUC) of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) activity over the first year of immunosuppression. At present the level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 is the most robust correlate of protection against COVID-19. In both study Groups the comparator of a delayed boost at 6 months is based on the premise of maximising peak NAb responses by administering the booster after induction therapy is completed. Such a delay must be weighed against the risk of reduced immunity and breakthrough COVID-19 infection during this period. Such a risk will be monitored closely during the study with scheduled interim safety analyses and reviews by an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB).\n\nParticipants in Group 1 will also receive a single diphtheria/tetanus (dT) toxoid booster as a comparator vaccine with the aim of determining whether the results of the optimal timing of the COVID-19 booster also apply to more traditional protein vaccines. If this is found to be the case, the results of this study may have broader implications for the vaccinology field and optimal clinical guidelines.\n\nPrimary Objective: to determine the anti-SARS-CoV-2 NAb response over 12 months from a booster with a SARS-CoV2 vaccine over 12 months in a population who; Group 1: are commencing moderate-to-severe immunosuppression for treatment of either a haematological malignancy (excluding BMT patients) or an autoimmune/inflammatory condition and are previously fully-immunised (i.e. had received 3 or more doses of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine including combinations) or, Group 2: have recently undergone a bone marrow transplant for a haematological malignancy and have previously received 3 post-BMT doses of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine including combinations.\n\nWe will determine the difference between the booster being administered as follows: Group 1: immediately prior to starting moderate-to-severe immunosuppression or at 6 months after therapy start, by monitoring the relative sustained immunogenicity over 1 year. Group 2: immediately at 6-months post-BMT or deferred until \\>12 months post-BMT.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. To assess a range of secondary immunological endpoints including:\n\n   1. . To quantitate antibodies to tetanus toxoid integrated over the 12-month period post-randomisation.\n   2. . To assess the safety and efficacy of the two approaches (immediate or deferred vaccination) including any indication of vaccine-induced disease flares and any breakthrough infections with SARS-CoV-2.\n   3. . To analyse the response to the SARS-CoV2 vaccine including: i. Breadth of NAb against the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) ii. The kinetics of neutralizing antibody over time including responses to VOC iii. Memory T cell, B cell and natural killer (NK) cell responses to peptide sets representing different domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein\n2. To assess these responses in populations stratified by broad disease type (i.e. haematological malignancy (excluding bone marrow transplant recipients), autoimmune/inflammatory disease or haematological malignancy post-BMT and different modes of immunosuppression e.g. chemotherapy, bone-marrow transplant, B-cell depleting therapies, cytokine inhibition.\n3. To use a computational biology approach to a) model the level of protection over time based on neutralizing antibody levels and b) model the boosting and decay of anti-Spike IgG, specific memory B, T and NK cell response to provide information on the impact of immunosuppression on vaccine protection over time.\n4. To use this evidence-base to inform policies regarding timing of additional SARS-CoV-2 boosters in vulnerable populations about to commence immunosuppression/or following bone marrow transplant. These findings will identify those patient groups most appropriate for synthetic COVID-19 monoclonal antibodies and will contribute to our understanding of vaccinology in the setting of immunosuppression and BMT more broadly, an area that remains poorly understood.\n5. To compare the change in health-related quality of life over time between \"immediate\" and \"deferred\" booster strategies.\n\nParticipant population\n\nParticipants will be recruited through a clinical network of specialist physicians at Sydney hospitals who will be recruiting from their Departments of Haematology, Immunology, Rheumatology, Gastroenterology and Neurology. A total of 320 participants will be enrolled into one of two Groups will be enrolled as outlined below:\n\nGroup 1: will comprise 280 participants commencing immunosuppression for the management of a pre-defined group of haematological malignancies (excluding bone marrow transplant recipients) or autoimmune/inflammatory conditions as outlined below Group 2: will comprise 40 participants who have undergone a bone marrow transplant for a haematological malignancy as outlined below.\n\nGroup 1:\n\nHaemato-Oncology: Haematological Malignancy (excluding bone marrow transplant recipients) - B-CLL; Follicular or Marginal Zone Lymphoma; Multiple Myeloma; Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\n\nSystematic Autoimmunity: to include: ANCA associated-vasculitis; polyarteritis nodosa; Churg-Strauss syndrome; ankylosing spondylitis; autoimmune hepatitis; IgG4 disease; inflammatory bowel disease; psoriatic arthritis; psoriasis; rheumatoid arthritis; systemic lupus erythematosus; Sjogren's syndrome; myasthenia gravis; and multiple sclerosis.

Group 1 participants will be screened to confirm their diagnosis and that they are to commence treatment that involves \\>1 year on moderate-to-severe immunosuppressive therapy. Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either Arm A; Immediate SARS-CoV-2 booster at week 0 and a booster of combined diphtheria toxoid/tetanus toxoid (dT vaccine) at 24 weeks, or Arm B; dT vaccine at week 0 and a deferred SARS-CoV-2 booster at 24 weeks.

    "detailed_description": "The new major challenge in the research concerns the circulating biomarkers, which aim at replacing the molecular analyses on tumour tissue obtained by biopsy (for example the search for somatic mutations of cancer) by a simple blood test (liquid biopsy).

There is almost no data in the literature on this aspect. It is very likely that the liberation in the blood of the blood tumoral markers is strongly dependent on medical interventions on the tumour.\n\nThe study ALCINA 2 rests exactly on the principle of small cohorts, which correspond each to a clinical situation and/or a technique of different implemented detection, so as to generate data of feasibility and proof of concept.

    "detailed_description": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a non-infectious inflammatory disease of the nasal mucosa mediated by Immunoglobulin E after exposure to allergens. AR has become a major chronic inflammatory disease of the respiratory tract, which has a serious impact on the quality of life of patients and social economy. The most important treatment for AR is topical nasal medications (including nasal corticosteroids, nasal antihistamines, nasal decongestants, and nasal saline irrigation etc.). However, even if patients are treated completely according to the standard diagnosis and treatment strategy, a considerable number of patients still do not achieve satisfactory treatment results. Arbidol is a medicine for the prevention and treatment of influenza. Based on our previous laboratory data, Arbidol may inhibit molecular targets involved in the pathogenesis of AR. In order to make the treatment of AR more effective, timely and convenient, this study intends to explore the effect of Arbidol in the treatment of allergic rhinitis and evaluate its efficacy and safety.",

Since Duavee\u00ae is currently not available commercially, the two separate components are used instead. Breast imaging, benign breast tissue by RPFNA, and blood for biomarkers will be obtained at baseline and at 6 months using similar assessment techniques. The primary endpoint is the difference between the BZA+CE and control groups for absolute change from baseline to 6 months in the risk biomarker fibroglandular volume (FGV). Volpara\u00ae fully automated assessments overcome the interpretive variance inherent in subjective assessments. Additional endpoints include changes in benign breast epithelial immunolabeling for Ki-67, estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1), progesterone receptor (PR), and anterior gradient-2 protein (AGR2); and systemic levels of bioavailable hormones, IGF-1, IGFBP3, and measures of insulin sensitivity.

However, these findings stem from only three of four patients receiving MRIs. A larger study will be required to determine if these promising results can be replicated. The proposed study will enroll 20 additional PD patients who will be randomly assigned to receive either lithium 20mg/day or identically-appearing placebo capsules for 24 weeks. This will be a double-blind study meaning that neither the patients nor the study team will know to which therapy patients have been assigned.

VMB-100 is administered as a transurethral injection into the urinary sphincter muscle. The injected mRNA is taken up by the muscle tissue cells and serves as a template for the translation of the protein IGF-1.\n\nInsulin-like growth factor-1 is secreted into the extracellular space, where it acts to promote muscle regeneration of the urinary sphincter via auto- and paracrine activation of downstream pathways in a localized manner.\n\nThe current understanding in urology is that reduced maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP) is the factor most strongly associated with SUI. This implies that improving function of the closure muscles would have therapeutic merit in both SUI as well as MUI with a predominant stress component.\n\nNo treatment which restores the physiology (regenerates the urinary sphincter muscle) is currently available. Given IGF-1's role in regenerating/maintaining muscle tissue women with SUI may benefit from a localized increase in IGF-1 levels in the urinary sphincter to regenerate muscle and restore sphincter function, thus alleviating the incontinence.",

    "brief_summary": "Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are chronic myeloid malignancies characterized by a risk of evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This unpredictable complication is associated with a grim outcome with median overall survival ranging between 2 to 10 months. To date, even allogeneic transplantation fails to significantly improve the prognosis. Biological and molecular mechanisms driving leukemic transformation are complex, ill-defined, and heterogeneous between patients. The investigator hypothesize that deciphering the molecular heterogeneity of post-MPN AML may lead identifying efficient drugs targeting of the most relevant leukemogenic pathways.\n\nOur main objective is to identify new targeted therapeutic approaches in post-MPN AML through in-depth characterization of the dysregulated pathways. The investigator will first characterize in an already annotated cohort of 120 post-MPN AML homogeneous patients subgroups using comprehensive multiomic analyses. Dysregulated pathways will be identified in each subgroup using the omics data and single-cell RNA-sequencing will be performed in a subset of patients in each subgroup. A customised drug-panel will be derived from the dysregulated pathway for an ex vivo drug screening, which will use a flow-cytometry read-out enabling to identity drug effect on cells survival, differentiation, and stemness. The 3 most promising drugs will be validated in a preclinical in vivo model of patient's derived xenograft (PDX) and their impact on clonal architecture will be studied in primary cell cultures using single-cell DNA-sequencing.\n\nOverall, this proposal may provide a better understanding of MPN leukemic transformation mechanisms and provide a path for personalized therapies. Our findings may therefore pave the way to drugs development in post-MPN AML that would provide a rationale for implementation of early clinical trials in these dreadful diseases.",
    "detailed_description": "Patients samples and clinical data:\n\nThe investigator will study samples from 120 patients with a post-MPN acute myeloid leukemia. These samples and the corresponding clinical data are available through FIMBANK, a national network of biological resources for myeloproliferative neoplasms (grant INCa, BCB 2013, Pr Val\u00e9rie Ugo) and through the prospective phase II clinical trial CPX351-TA-SMP testing CPX351 monotherapy in post-MPN AML (NCT04992949, inclusions started in 01-2022).\n\nWP1: Deciphering the heterogeneity of post-MPN AML (primary objective) To answer these objectives, the investigator will conduct a multi-omics approach including targeted-NGS with a 400-genes panel, RNA-seq and methylome in a total of 120 post-MPN AML samples. All the genomic libraries will be constructed at the genomic facility of Angers University Hospital and the sequencing will be performed on a NovaSeq6000 in the GenoBIRD Platform in Nantes. Bioinformatic analysis will be performed by teams #1 and #3 and will derive for each sample: SNV/Indel and CNV from DNA sequencing, expression of mRNA and lncRNA, genes fusion and splicing events from RNA-seq, and methylation beta-values from methylome.\n\nIn order to identify homogeneous subgroups from the genomic data, the investigator will perform unsupervised clustering analyses of each layer of genomic data. Then, all layers will be combined for integration of clusters using the Cluster Of Clusters Analysis (COCA) method (Wilkerson and Hayes, 2010).\n\nWP2: Identify the mechanisms of transformation and putative targets for therapy For this purpose, the investigator will analyze omics data generated in WP1 to identify the main molecular mechanisms driving the leukemic transformation of MPN. The investigator will perform a 2-step procedure: first by analyzing each genomic dataset separately and then, by analyzing all datasets together in an integrated multiblock analysis using the MOGSA method (Integrative Single Sample Gene-set).\n\nA total of 60 samples originating from a subset of patients classified in WP1 will be tested for ex vivo drug screening. The investigator will design a custom-made drug panel including standards of care, several drugs in clinical development in AML and, more importantly, a selection of drugs specifically targeting potential leukemic vulnerabilities identified.\n\nWP3: Confirm the efficacy of selected best drugs and their impact on clonal architecture To further validate the translational relevance of post-MPN AML deregulated pathways, the three most promising drug candidates will then be evaluated in a set of five post-MPN PDX models including at least 2 TP53-mutated post-MPN AML. The investigator will also evaluate how the drugs identified in WP2 may impact clonal evolution of the disease which is a key step towards understanding and improving the treatment of post-MPN AML. The 3 best candidate drugs or combinations identified in WP2 will be studied in cells from 5 selected patients with a complex molecular profile to evaluate the response of various subclones.",

Eighty participants with sciatica will be randomized to receive placebo (2000 mg starch daily) or ginger (2000 mg daily) for 8 weeks. This study will evaluate the effects of ginger supplementation on gut function measured as gut microbiota composition using 16S rRNA sequencing analysis, intestinal permeability based on plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein and fecal zonulin using ELISA, and fecal metabolites using LC-MS/MS analysis (SA 1); on neuroinflammation in whole blood mRNA using nCounter\u00ae Neuroinflammation Panels analysis (SA 2); and on pain-associated outcomes and brain neuroplasticity by assessing functional (resting state-fMRI) and structural (Diffusion Tensor Imaging) connectivity (SA 3).",

PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Chemotherapy drugs, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

    "brief_summary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of the drugs dexamethasone, tocilizumab and anakinra in healthy male subjects aged 18 to 35 undergoing experimental endotoxemia. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* What are the effects of these drugs on the development of immunoparalysis in a repeated human endotoxemia model?\n* What is the extent of the neuroinflammatory response and how do these drugs affect neuroinflammation in a repeated human endotoxemia model?\n\nResearchers will compare these drugs to a placebo (a look-alike substance that contains no drug).\n\nParticipants will visit the Intensive Care research department on two or five occasions (screening included):\n\n* The intervention group will receive an LPS challenge twice, with a week in between. Before the first LPS challenge, one of the described drugs will be administered. Blood, saliva and tear fluid will be collected regularly during the LPS challenge. Cerebrospinal fluid will also be collected through a catheter in the spinal cord.\n* The control group will not receive an LPS challenge or drug administration and will have only one study day. During this day, blood, saliva, tear fluid and cerebrospinal fluid will be collected as regularly as during the LPS challenge of the intervention group.\n\nDuring an LPS challenge, the investigators mimic blood poisoning by giving an endotoxin, also called LPS. This is a small part of the cell wall of a bacteria. This will cause transient flu-like symptoms for 3-4 hours.",
    "detailed_description": "The experimental human endotoxemia model is a controlled, standardized and safe model of systemic (sepsis-like) inflammation induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in healthy volunteers. This model captures many hallmarks of both the hyperinflammatory phenotype (observed following a first LPS challenge) and the immunoparalytic phenotype (observed following a second LPS challenge one week later) of sepsis.\n\nIn this study the investigators aim to determine the effects of dexamethasone, tocilizumab and anakinra within the repeated experimental human endotoxemia model on the development of immunoparalysis, reflected by between-group differences in plasma TNF (and other cytokine) concentrations upon the second LPS challenge. The investigators will also profile inflammatory parameters in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), reflected by within- and between-group differences in CSF TNF (and other cytokine) concentrations following the first LPS challenge, to gain insights in inflammatory responses of the central nervous system.\n\nAnti-inflammatory drugs may help reduce sepsis-induced immunoparalysis and, somewhat counterintuitively, improve immune responses later by dampening the initial hyperinflammation. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, are key in triggering this immunosuppression. Reducing early hyperinflammation could also prevent postoperative immune suppression, lowering the risk of infections. Drugs like dexamethasone, tocilizumab, and anakinra may affect neuroinflammation, depending on their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB).\n\nFurthermore, the investigators will explore whether cytokine profiles in saliva and tear fluid can be used as a proxy for circulating cytokine responses. Saliva and tear fluid cytokines may serve as non-invasive alternatives to blood measurements, especially for vulnerable populations, though more research is needed to validate their reliability.\n\nComprehensive assessment of cellular components and cytokine dynamics in blood, CSF, saliva, and tear fluid will be conducted using RNA sequencing, providing insights into cellular and molecular mechanisms during endotoxemia and drug effects. This research will help identify new drug targets and better understand the immunomodulatory effects of dexamethasone, tocilizumab, and anakinra on inflammation and immunosuppression.",

    "brief_summary": "In the human genome, about 750 genes contain one intron excised by the minor spliceosome. These genes are named U12 genes, and these introns, minor or U12 introns. The minor spliceosome comprises its own set of snRNAs, among which U4atac. Its non-coding gene, RNU4ATAC, has been found mutated in Taybi-Linder (TALS), Roifman (RFMN) and Lowry-Wood syndromes (LWS). These rare developmental disorders associate ante- and post-natal growth retardation, microcephaly, skeletal dysplasia, intellectual disability, retinal dystrophy and immunodeficiency. Their physiopathological mechanisms remain unsolved: the number of U12 genes involved, their identity and function, or the cellular mechanisms impacted by the splicing defect, are still unknown.\n\nThe hypothesis of the study is that U12 genes coding for primary cilia components are particularly sensitive to minor splicing defects caused by RNU4ATAC mutations. Indeed, a child showing signs of TALS but negative for RNU4ATAC was found to carry a homozygous variant in the RTTN gene, coding for the rotatin protein located at the centrosome and the base of the primary cilia and playing a role in maintaining these structures. In addition, bi-allelic RNU4ATAC mutations were identified in five patients presenting with traits suggestive of the Joubert syndrome (JBTS), a well-characterized ciliopathy. These patients also present with traits typical of TALS/RFMN/LWS.\n\nTo better understand the causes of these pathologies, a cohort of patients with syndromes associated with bi-allele mutations of the RNU4ATAC or RTTN gene will be gathered, in order to conduct studies on the cells of these patients. Blood samples will be taken, as well as skin biopsies, if possible. These samples will be used to create induced pluripotent stem cell lines. Blood samples will also be collected from the parents of RNU4ATAC patients, to eliminate in transcriptomic analyses expression variations due to differences in genetic background. Biopsies of skin, muscle and brain tissue will be collected on foetuses carrying two-allele RNU4ATAC or RTTN mutations whose parents have had a miscarriage or have chosen to have a medical abortion. The biological samples collected will be used to study the transcription level of U12 genes, the splicing of their pre-messenger RNA, their main cellular functions, and the structural characteristics of tissues and cells.",

    "detailed_description": "Indicators of longevity in humans include skeletal muscle mass and strength. Muscle mass is determined by the balance between myofibrillar protein synthesis and degradation, influenced by diet and physical activity. Muscle strength is closely tied to muscle mass, and activities like weight lifting until failure have been shown to increase muscle protein synthesis, enhancing muscle mass and strength over time. Protein intake is essential for maintaining a positive protein balance and promoting muscle growth. While animal proteins are generally more effective than plant proteins at promoting muscle protein synthesis, many cultures rely on staple plant-based foods, such as maize, rather than animal-based protein sources.\n\nMaize (Zea mays) flour is a leading staple in African diets, where it is consumed in various forms, including porridges and breads like Ugali in East Africa or Fufu in West Africa. The nutritional profile of this corn bread varies greatly depending on whether it is made with refined or whole-grain maize flour. Whole-grain maize flour retains the bran, germ, and endosperm, providing higher fiber, vitamins, and minerals, while refined maize flour primarily contains the endosperm. Although refined maize is lower in fiber, it has a higher proportion of the leucine-rich zein, a major corn protein. These nutritional differences could significantly impact metabolism and overall health.\n\nGiven that approximately a fifth of the global population relies on corn meal as a dietary staple, understanding the impact of refined versus whole-grain maize flour on muscle protein synthesis and serum amino acid content could provide valuable insights for dietary guidelines and public health. This study aims to explore these effects, comparing the post-meal nutrient profile and muscle protein synthesis response to traditional African corn bread made with whole-grain versus refined maize flour.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to quantify and compare the serum nutrient and hormonal profile and muscle protein synthesis rates in response to consuming isonitrogenous servings of traditional African corn bread made from whole-grain or refined maize flour, paired with mung bean stew.\n\nSpecific aim 1: Describe the post-prandial nutrient and hormonal profile in serum in the 3 hours following consumption of a portion of mung bean stew with traditional African corn bread made with either whole grain maize flour or refined maize flour.\n\nSpecific aim 2: Compare the ability a portion of mung bean stew and traditional African corn bread made with either whole grain maize flour or refined maize flour to activate mTORC1-specific and whole muscle protein synthesis in an in vitro model of muscle.\n\nStudy participants will attend the CTSC Clinical Research Center on two separate occasions.\n\nThe two study visits will be scheduled over a 2-week period (i.e., once per week for 2 weeks) at the same time in the morning after an overnight fast of more than 12 hours. Participants will be asked to refrain from vigorous exercise, caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol for 24 hours before each visit. Female participants will schedule their visits within the first two weeks of their menstrual cycle to control for hormone fluctuations that may affect digestion and metabolism.\n\nUpon arrival at the research center for the first test visit, each participant's height and weight will be measured. They will also complete a questionnaire covering their physical activity and dietary habits.\n\nI. Baseline blood draw.\n\nParticipants will be seated in individual testing rooms equipped with reclining phlebotomy armchairs. A nurse will insert a 22G catheter into a forearm vein to collect an initial 5 mL baseline blood sample.\n\nII. Test meal.\n\nAfter baseline blood collection, participants will consume one of the two corn bread test meals. The meal consists of a serving of mung bean stew and an isonitrogenous amount of either whole-grain or refined maize flour-based corn bread:\n\nThe food will be weighed before cooking, and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt will be added to enhance palatability and participants will be asked to consume the meal within a 10-minute period, chewing thoroughly. Participants will also drink a 250 mL glass of water with the meal.\n\nIII. Postprandial blood draws.\n\nAfter the test meal, participants will remain at the research site in their testing rooms for 3 hours, where they may bring books or electronic devices to occupy themselves.

    "brief_summary": "The aim of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a known diuretic drug, Bumetanide, in terms of improvement of memory and psychological functioning in children and adolescents with Down syndrome (DS), in order to develop therapeutic strategies for cognitive and psychopathology aspects associated with the syndrome. The study also aims to identify possible predictors and biological and genetic markers related to the efficacy of the treatment. Recently, preliminary studies conducted on the animal model of Down syndrome have proven the efficacy of the drug Bumetanide in counteracting some brain anomalies related to communication between nerve cells (synaptic transmission) typical of the syndrome, with the effect of improving memory skills. Behaviour-enhancing effects have also been found in preliminary studies in humans with other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders). The drug Bumetanide could therefore be useful in counteracting the biological mechanisms that cause some cognitive deficits associated with Down syndrome. The potential of this therapeutic approach will be tested through a clinical trial in a population of children and adolescent patients with DS, in a randomized placebo-controlled trial with a three-month treatment with Bumetanide. Participants will be randomly assigned to the experimental group that will receive the treatment (Bumetanide) vs the control/comparison group that will receive the placebo. Bumetanide is a diuretic drug that has been widely used in humans in the past with few side effects, is orally active, and is very inexpensive. 64 participants will be recruited.",
    "detailed_description": "Down syndrome (DS) is a leading cause of genetically defined intellectual disability. It is characterized by low IQ and cognitive deficits, especially learning and memory. Among the neurobiological causes of these deficits, the increased generation of GABAergic interneurons in the forebrain during development is thought to impair learning and memory in Ts65Dn mice, inducing excessive inhibition and a consequent imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory signals. This derangement would affect cognition in Ts65Dn mice by altering hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Indeed, both LTP and cognitive deficits can be improved by reducing the GABA-mediated signal strength through GABAAR antagonist treatment. Some studies on animal models have helped to demonstrate that the use of an inhibitor of the NKCC1 pump such as Bumetanide helps to restore the imbalance of the GABAergic signal and the synaptic plasticity of the hippocampus with a consequent improvement in memory and learning abilities even after only one treatment week. Recently, the modulation of the GABAergic signal by inhibiting the activity of the NKCC1 pump, a specific inhibitor such as Bumetanide, has demonstrated enormous potential for improving epileptic symptoms and autistic symptoms (disorders associated with an imbalance of the excitatory/inhibitory synaptic signal) in animal models and humans and of memory deficits in DS animal models. The hypothesis of the study is therefore that the use of Bumetanide can counteract the alterations of the cerebral GABAergic signal in people with DS, improving their cognitive and psychological abilities. This is a non-profit phase II randomized placebo-controlled study involving 64 participants. The study for each patient will be concluded at the end of treatment (at 3 months) and follow-up (at 5 months). In general, the study will be concluded with the follow-up visit of the last 64th patient. The enrollment of patients will last one year and will take place, like all the visits foreseen by the trial, only at the IRCCS Bambino Ges\u00f9 Pediatric Hospital in Rome - Trials Complex Operative Unit. For some biomarker analyses, the study makes use of collaboration with the Italian Institute of Technology and the Giannina Gaslini Institute of Genoa. Participation in the study includes an initial visit to verify that the subject's condition meets the criteria required by the study. Subsequently, six follow-up visits will be scheduled after 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months (end of treatment), and 2 months after the end of treatment (after 5 months from the start of treatment). Bumetanide drug and placebo (indistinguishable) will be dispensed to participants during the first (Day 1), second (Day 7\u00b1 1), and fourth visit (Day 31\u00b1 3). Participants in the Bumetanide group will be treated for three months with a dose of 0.02 mg/kg twice a day orally. Participants in the control group will take a placebo twice a day for three months orally. All participants in the study will undergo instrumental and laboratory tests according to the schedule and times indicated below:\n\n* Psychological and neuropsychological evaluation at the time of recruitment (at the first visit - Day 1), at the end of treatment (after three months - Day 31\u00b1 3), and two months after the end of treatment (after five months from the start of treatment - Day 150 \u00b1 4). This evaluation will be carried out through long-term memory tasks, executive functions measures and adaptive level, and through scales and interviews on the psychopathological aspects and will be important for evaluating the effects of the treatment. The first visit includes cognitive level assessment (Day 1).\n* Questionnaire on quality of life, sleep, and stool and the analysis of vital signs will be performed at the first visit on Day 1, after one week (Day 7\u00b1 1), after one month (Day 31\u00b1 3), after three months (Day 90 \u00b1 3) and after two months from the conclusion (five months from the start of treatment - (Day 150 \u00b1 4).\n* Physical examination in the first visit (Day 1), after one week (Day 7\u00b1 1), after one month (Day 31\u00b1 3), after three months (Day 90 \u00b1 3), after two months from the conclusion of the treatment (five months from the beginning of the treatment- Day 150 \u00b1 4).\n* Blood sampling, specifically, for the analysis of electrolytes and blood gas and for hemogenic and liver function tests during all visits (Day 1 Day 7\u00b1 1, Day 15\u00b1 1, Day 31\u00b1 3, Day 61\u00b1 3, Day 90 \u00b1 3, Day 150 \u00b1 4 ). \u2022Urine analysis at first visit (Day 1 during all visits (Day 1 Day 7\u00b1 1, Day 15\u00b1 1, Day 31\u00b1 3, Day 61\u00b1 3, Day 90 \u00b1 3, Day 150 \u00b1 4).\n* Audiometric test at the start of treatment (Day 1), after one month (Day 31\u00b1 3), after three months (end of treatment - Day 90 \u00b1 3) and two months after the end of treatment (five months after start of treatment - Day 150 \u00b1 4). \u2022 Electrocardiogram (ECG) at the first visit (Day 1), after one week (Day 7\u00b1 1), after one month (Day 31\u00b1 3), after three months (end of treatment - Day 90 \u00b1 3), and two months after the end of treatment (five months after starting treatment - Day 150 \u00b1 4).\n* Electroencephalogram (EEG) at the first visit (Day 1), after one month (Day 31\u00b1 3) after three months (end of treatment - Day 90 \u00b1 3), and two months after the end of treatment (five months after the start of treatment - Day 150 \u00b1 4).\n* Nephrological evaluation at first visit (Day 1), after one week (Day 7\u00b1 1), after two weeks (Day 15\u00b1 1), after one month (Day 31\u00b1 3), after two months and at the end of treatment (after three months - Day 90 \u00b1 3).\n* Pregnancy test for girls before starting treatment (Day-1).\n\nThe study also predict safety measures. Adverse events will be recorded using the UKU side effect rating scale. Furthermore, participants will be closely monitored by Investigators during critical periods before, during and after the treatment.",

In one arm of this study, we will investigate the safety and immunologic activity of RNA-LP vaccines in pediatric patients with recurrent pHGG.\n\nThe investigators have also shown that intravenous administration of tumor mRNA loaded lipid particles (LPs) localizes primarily to lung, transfect antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lead to an activated T cell response for induction of anti-tumor immunity. In contrast to other formulations, RNA-LPs recruit multiple arms of the immune system (i.e. innate/adaptive), and remodel the systemic/intratumoral immune milieu, which remain potent barriers for vaccine, cellular, and checkpoint inhibiting immunotherapies. After only a single RNA-LP vaccine, the bulk of systemic and intratumoral dendritic cells (DCs) in mice display an activated phenotype; these activated DCs (harvested from tumors) expand antigen specific T cell immunity. In immunologically resistant pulmonary osteosacroma murine tumor models (i.e. K7M2), RNA-LPs induce robust anti-tumor efficacy in settings where immune checkpoint inhibitors (i.e. anti-PD-L1 therapy) do not confer therapeutic benefit. The investigators have already demonstrated safety of RNA-LPs in acute/chronic murine toxicity studies, and in client-owned canine trial.\n\nIn this study, we will investigate the manufacturing feasibility, safety and immunologic activity of RNA-LP vaccine in patients with recurrent pulmonary or unresectable osteosarcoma and recurrent pHGG.",

The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Will the inclusion of MFGM in RUTF for 6-59-month-old Sierra Leonean children with severe acute malnutrition improve their neurodevelopment?\n* Will the inclusion of MFGM in RUTF for 6-59-month-old Sierra Leonean children with severe acute malnutrition reduce its worst consequences: death, hospitalization, and remaining severely malnourished despite treatment?\n\nResearchers will compare the MFGM-containing RUTF to standard RUTF, which contains skim milk powder.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* undergo measurement of length, weight, mid-upper arm circumference, and nutritional edema assessment every two weeks during severe malnutrition treatment\n* be treated with either MFGM-RUTF or standard RUTF at a dose of 2 sachets per day for up to 12 weeks\n* undergo neurodevelopmental testing using the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool at the end of SAM treatment and 6 months later\n* a subset of participants will undergo blood spot collection and stool sample collection",
    "detailed_description": "Globally, approximately 15 million children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM) at any one time, a number that has not declined in recent decades despite significant technological advancements in agriculture and food science. SAM is a condition of total-body depletion of the nutrients required for health and development; without treatment, 50% of affected children will die. Whereas historically children with SAM were admitted to and treated within hospitals, the advent of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) and community-based management of acute malnutrition revolutionized SAM care by allowing it to occur safely and successfully by the child's caregiver in their own home.\n\nRUTF was designed to provide the nutrients required for physical recovery in a safe, palatable format. It is equal parts peanut paste, sugar, vegetable oil, and skim milk powder, with added micronutrients and emulsifier. At inception, attention was not specifically paid to how RUTF's composition might impact neurodevelopmental recovery in children with SAM. Research over the past decade has revealed that even following successful treatment with RUTF, children diagnosed with SAM still score 1-3 standard deviations below age-based expectations on neurodevelopmental tests. This suggests that the nutrient profile of standard RUTF is not sufficient to recover the developmental damage incurred by SAM.\n\nRecently, progress has been made toward improving the developmental trajectory of children with SAM by altering RUTF. A randomized, blinded trial in Malawi including 2,500 children with SAM showed that improving the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) profile of RUTF by reducing linoleic acid and adding docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) yields superior neurodevelopment 6 months after treatment, by 0.19 standard deviations on a standardized, culturally adapted neurodevelopmental test. This demonstrates that neurodevelopmental recovery in SAM is sensitive to the lipid profile of RUTF. Despite the benefits of improved PUFA RUTF, however, children with SAM remained 1 standard deviation below expectations in neurodevelopment.\n\nThe milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) in mammalian milk contains a host of nutrients and bioactive compounds supportive of physical health and brain development. Bovine MFGM added to infant formula has been tested in several clinical trials and has demonstrated a reduction in infectious episodes, such as diarrhea and ear infections, as well as improvement in cognitive development, compared with infant formula not containing MFGM. In these trials and others, MFGM has been shown to be safe and well-tolerated. Currently, RUTF contains skim milk powder as its high-quality protein source, and peanut and vegetable oils as the primary sources of fat. These vegetable fat sources are deficient in the lipids provided by MFGM: sphingolipids, cholesterol, and other phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, all of which play roles in brain development. It is possible that the lipids contained in MFGM may further support neurodevelopmental recovery in SAM children.\n\nBy acting as a natural emulsifier, MFGM also offers a food formulation advantage that is relevant to children with SAM. Animal model studies have demonstrated that emulsifiers can compromise the gut barrier. Children with SAM have damaged small intestinal barrier function, which can lead to translocation of gut bacteria and resulting systemic infection. As RUTF will compose nearly 100% of a child's intake for the duration of treatment - up to 3 months - it is possible that inclusion of emulsifier may impede gut healing and recovery. Considering this concern, the Manary lab ran a clinical trial in 2018-2019 testing a novel formulation of RUTF designed with oat in place of some skim milk powder and peanut, and without hydrogenated vegetable oil (standard emulsifier), because oat acts as a natural emulsifier. In this trial, children with SAM receiving the oat-RUTF had 10% absolute higher recovery and a 33% relative reduction in the worst SAM outcomes (death, hospitalization, or remaining severely malnourished). Like oat, MFGM in RUTF allows for omission of emulsifier and may yield similar benefits.\n\nGiven (1) the repeated finding that adding MFGM to infant formulas improves neurodevelopment, (2) the impaired neurodevelopment of children with SAM, (3) the current RUTF formulation lacking neuro-supportive fats provided by MFGM, (4) MFGM's natural activity as an emulsifier, and (5), the reality that RUTF provides the sole source of nutrition for children with SAM, it is plausible that adding this high-quality source of lipids and protein to RUTF may also benefit children with SAM in both immediate and long-term physical and cognitive recovery.\n\nThis will be an individually randomized, investigator/outcomes assessors-blinded, controlled clinical trial designed to determine if treatment of severely malnourished Sierra Leonean children 6-59-months of age with an RUTF made with MFGM-containing whey protein/fat concentrate will (1) improve neurodevelopment and (2) reduce a composite of poor SAM outcomes (death, hospitalization, remaining severely malnourished), compared with standard RUTF (S-RUTF). This trial will be conducted at 20 rural sites in Sierra Leone. 1600 children will be randomized 1:1 to receive 2 sachets per day of either MFGM-RUTF or S-RUTF. Children will receive their allocated RUTF and return to clinic fortnightly for repeat anthropometric measurements, illness questions, and to receive more RUTF until they achieve a clinical outcome or for a maximum of 12 weeks, at which point they will undergo Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT) testing. Participants will be asked to return to clinic 6 (5-7) months later for MDAT testing, the global z-score from which will be the trial's co-primary outcome. A subset of participants will undergo blood spot and/or stool sample collection at the end of SAM treatment.",

    "brief_summary": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a very common and chronic lung condition and is a leading cause of morbidity and death. These patients have persistent breathlessness and exercise intolerance, affecting their ability to carry out routine daily tasks. Standard COPD treatments include medicines/puffers as well as participation in a Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) program. PR programs are delivered by a diverse team of healthcare experts in exercise and nutrition. It is possible that an emerging nutritional oral supplement could target the muscular dysfunction seen in patients with COPD in part by promoting better working mitochondria, the energy 'engine' of muscle. A series of recently published studies in sedentary adults and in older adults have demonstrated the safety, tolerability, and potential clinical effectiveness of this supplement.\n\nIn this regard, the investigators plan to lead a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test whether oral supplementation in patients with COPD who are also participating in a standard PR program will improve overall exercise performance. The investigators will also test muscle strength, cognition, body composition, and other clinically important outcomes such as quality of life. Lastly, the investigators will use muscle tissue from a subgroup of volunteers to investigate the effect on muscle/mitochondrial structure/function.\n\nThe focus is actually the critical 'first step' before the larger RCT: a pilot and feasibility study on a smaller number of participants with COPD, as an important proof-of-concept that the larger study can, and should, be conducted.",
    "detailed_description": "The main objectives for this pilot feasibility study are to document recruitment rates, collect information on participant acceptability of tests, establish the capacity to run the RCT at our site, to demonstrate successful molecular testing of specimens, and to generate pilot data for the outcomes being tested in the larger subsequent RCT.\n\nThe overarching goal for the 'larger', future project will be to determine the effect of the oral supplement on exercise capacity, muscle strength, mitochondrial function, health-related quality of life, cognition, symptom burden, and safety/adherence in patients with COPD who are participating in a Pulmonary Rehabilitation program. The goal of the present research project is to complete a pilot and feasibility study testing the same clinical outcomes on a smaller sample of eligible study participants during which participants receive the intervention for 8 weeks.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine whether administration of the oral supplement during participation in a standard multi-week in-person Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) program is associated with an improvement in exercise endurance capacity in patients with COPD, compared with PR participation and placebo supplementation.\n\nThe secondary objectives are to determine the effect of the oral supplement on i) global conditioning and exercise capacity; ii) muscle strength; iii) mitochondrial function; iv) body composition; v) quality of life and burden of disease; vi) cognition; vii) adverse events/complications and adherence, and viii) blood levels of Urolithin A.\n\nWe hypothesize that patients with COPD receiving oral supplementation during PR participation will demonstrate an improvement in Constant Work Rate Exercise Test (CRWET) time after 8 weeks when compared to patients with COPD who receive placebo and PR participation.",

This first-in-human study is aimed to evaluate the safety and preliminary effectiveness of Exosome-based ldlr mRNA nanoplatform for gene therapy in HoFH.",
    "detailed_description": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by severely elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) and premature coronary heart disease. Most of FH patients (about 95% of cases) are attributed to functional loss mutation of the LDL receptor (LDLR) gene. The prevalence of the heterozygous mutations in LDLR has been estimated at 1 in 200 to 1 in 500 in the population, and the homozygous form in 1 in 100000 individuals. As a key lipoprotein receptor on the surface of hepatocyte, the LDLR is critical for liver clearing LDL-C from the circulation. By endocytosis and further processing of the LDL-C, LDLR is responsible for removing most excess LDL-C from the serum, and there are no substitutes in vivo. These heterozygotes (HeFH) typically have twice the normal plasma LDL levels and cardiovascular diseases at an earlier age. Homozygous individuals (HoFH) face much higher LDL-C levels and often die before the age of 20 years if untreated. Although existing therapeutics, such as statins, ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors, have some beneficial effects on HeFH, few drugs have therapeutic effects on HoFH even at high-doses. Lipid apheresis and liver transplantation are the current clinical managements to reduce the LDL-C level, while gene therapy holds the promise.\n\nExosomes are small intracellular vesicles ranging in 30-150 nm size and have an important role in cell-cell communication. Many studies show that exosome can efficiently deliver cargos, such as mRNA, miRNA and even plasmid DNA, to target cells, emerging as a promising therapeutic carrier for gene therapy. Compared with virus, exosomes, as \"natural nanoparticles\", are easy to handle, non-cytotoxic and non-immunogenic. It is thus promising to develop exosome-based LDLR-gene delivery strategy and explore the therapeutic effects on HoFH.\n\nIn this study, an Ldlr-expressing virus vector will be constructed to generate Ldlr mRNA-enriched exosomes. To meet the standards of clinical trials, we will use the GMP-grade compliant normal donor bone marrow-derived MSCs to produce exosomes. Exosomes will be enriched by filtration and ultracentrifugation, and then normalized by Nanosight, Electron microscopy and key exosomes biomarkers. In order to ensure the safety of patients, we plan to inject exosomes through abdominal puncture under ultrasound guidance, and purchase medical insurance for patients. This first-in-human study is aimed to evaluate the safety of this exosome product for gene therapy and preliminary evidence of efficacy using plasma LDL-C levels as a surrogate biomarker. The study is promising to provide a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia patients.",

Increases in another type of (normal) hemoglobin, fetal globin (HbF), which is normally silenced in infancy, reduces anemia and morbidity. Even incremental augmentation of fetal globin is established to reduce red blood cell pathology, anemia, certain complications, and to improve survival.\n\nThis trial will evaluate an oral drug discovered in a high throughput screen, which increases fetal globin protein (HbF and red blood cells expressing HbF)and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) to high levels in anemic nonhuman primates and in transgenic mice. The study drug acts by suppressing 4 repressors of the fetal globin gene promoter in progenitor cells from patients. The drug has been used for 50 years in a combination product for different actions - to enhance half-life and reduce side effects of a different active drug- and is considered safe for long-term use.\n\nThis trial will first evaluate 3 dose levels in small cohorts of nontransfused patients with beta thalassemia intermedia.

Additive effects are observed with hydroxyurea in sickle cell patients' cells in vitro.\n\nThe study will first evaluate the study therapeutic in male and female patients who are 18 years and older. After a screening period to obtain baseline medical and laboratory data, the study drug will be taken by mouth once per day, every other day. The first dose will be taken in a clinical unit, and thereafter will be taken at home for 12 weeks. Laboratory tests, physical exams, and tolerability will be assessed 6 times over 4 months, including for one month after completion of dosing.\n\nThe cohorts will be enrolled sequentially. Each new cohort will begin after the prior lower dose cohort has received 2 weeks of treatment without serious adverse events related to the study drug. The dose that increases fetal globin assays to the highest degree will be evaluated in a larger group of subjects with beta thalassemia intermedia and a groups with sickle cell disease. Other regimens or test doses may be added as needed to identify an active dose and regimen. The study drug is expected to be safe when added to most other medications used to treat thalassemia.",

    "brief_summary": "Measles, a highly contagious disease, is potentially serious in adult allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) recipients. Because of the loss of immunity to vaccine preventable diseases after allo-HSCT, French Health Authorities (Haut Conseil de Sant\u00e9 Publique, HCSP) recommend (re)vaccination of all allo-HSCT recipients against measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) from 24 months post-transplant onwards, in the absence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and at least 3 months after cessation of all immunosuppressive treatments, irrespective of measles serostatus. Nevertheless, some French experts argue that systematic assessment of measles antibody titre is justified after allo-HSCT, prior to revaccination, in order to avoid \"unnecessary\" revaccination of allo-HSCT recipients who are still seropositive. At the international level, recommendations also vary: the ECIL group and IDSA advocate revaccination of measles seronegative patients only, while some American Hematology experts recommend not to base the decision of revaccination on the serological status, given the inevitable loss of antibodies and specific long-term immune memory in the absence of revaccination.\n\nSeveral obstacles to the application of the recommendations can therefore be identified: (i) the risk of vaccine-transmitted disease due to the live-attenuated nature of MMR, (ii) the lack of robust data on the immunogenicity and tolerability of the MMR vaccine in this particular population, and (iii) conflicting recommendations to guide the decision of revaccination.\n\nThis study aims at answering the question of whether some allo-HSCT recipients may retain a measles-specific cellular immune memory at distance from their allo-HSCT.",

However, this technique has several limitations, including the variable quality of swabs, its invasive nature, and arbitrariness in the choice of the number of cycles. Furthermore, it does not allow for the detection of viral proteins.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, researchers developed the eBAM-CoV test, patented for the detection of viral proteins in the exhaled air of COVID-19 patients. This portable device provides an immediate assessment of the \"viral load\" with both quantitative and qualitative results, showing promise for early virus detection.\n\nThe researchers hypothesize that the eBAM-CoV test is likely to exhibit a satisfactory concordance with the reference RT-PCR test in the detection of COVID-19, especially among symptomatic patients or closed contacts.",

    "brief_summary": "Stroke survivors experience severe muscle wasting during the chronic phase of recovery, with implications for strength, function and general health. Although resistive exercise training effectively combats this problem, it is unknown whether sub-optimal protein intake limits the observed gains in skeletal muscle growth. Skeletal muscle adaptations may occur when resistive training (RT) is combined with nutritional therapy in the form of post- exercise protein consumption. This study would be the first to directly compare RT+protein supplementation to RT+placebo (same calories as protein supplement) in those with chronic hemiparesis caused by stroke, providing evidence-based rationale for combination therapy in the clinical care of this population.",
    "detailed_description": "The VA research team has played a prominent role in documenting the significant skeletal muscle atrophy that accompanies chronic hemiparesis after disabling stroke. Muscle volume is reduced by 24% in paretic vs. non-paretic legs, having significant implications for strength, function, fitness, metabolism and general health. The investigators' previous work establishes progressive, high-intensity resistive training (RT) as an effective rehabilitation strategy for older stroke survivors, producing thigh muscle hypertrophy on both the paretic and non-paretic sides. Protein supplementation can significantly augment gains in muscle mass after RT in healthy populations, but no experiments have yet been conducted in stroke. New preliminary data from the investigators' group indicates that stroke participants consume 20% less protein than the recommended daily amount for older individuals (0.80 vs. 1.0 g/kg/day) suggesting that relative gains in skeletal muscle could be significantly better in the presence of adequate protein intake. New data also indicates that leg muscle mass predicts resting metabolic rate (RMR) in stroke, implying that a combined nutrition and RT therapy aimed at maximizing muscle gains would translate into improved energy balance, a key factor in rehabilitation success. A better understanding of the true potential for aggressive RT interventions to address stroke-related atrophy and related problems for maximum benefit awaits clinical trials directly comparing RT with and without nutritional therapy. The investigators propose to conduct a 12-week randomized placebo controlled clinical trial comparing the effects of RT+ protein supplementation at 1.2 g/kg/day (RT+PRO) vs. RT+isocaloric placebo (RT+PLA) on body composition, hypertrophy, strength, functional mobility and energy expenditure in chronic stroke.",

The single most important factor in preventing severe medical consequences, like colon removal surgery or cancer, is treatment to completely heal the top layer of the intestine as quickly as possible. Healing is a complex process and the dysfunction observed in colitis can only be fully understood by comparison to healing in non-IBD patients.\n\nThis is a prospective trial involving three groups of patients: 1) IBD patients with active disease, newly treated with anti-TNF therapy (biologic failure or na\u00efve); 2) non-IBD patients with rheumatoid/psoriatic arthritis who are receiving anti-TNF therapy, and 3) healthy control patients.

Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), play such role as 'a double agent', transmitting the pain signals and initiating the cardio-protective mechanism via release protective neuropeptides.\n\nSurgery-related pain is mostly so severe and disturbing that must be medically treated. Unfortunately, the beneficial aspect of pain is commonly ignored in daily clinical practice. Does it matter to the patients' outcomes? We don't know yet! What we have been seeing is the shocking outcomes of patients underwent surgery, which shows about 0.8% and 7% of mortalities in the period of 48 hours and 30 days after surgery, respectively (https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/projects/outputs/national-hip-fracture-database-annual-report-2016; Injury. 2017; 48(10): 2180-2183). What causes the disaster? Piles of evidence demonstrate that deep anesthesia or deep sedation is related to the high mortality of the patients (Anesthesiology. 2012; 116:1195-1203; Crit Care. 2014; 18(4):R156 ). What about the effect of analgesia, especially the over-analgesia, on the patients' outcome in and after surgery? Opioids are the most commonly used drugs in the treatment of moderate and sever pain including intra- and postoperative pain. The \u00b5-opioid receptor agonists induce analgesic effect via inhibition of the transduction and the transmission of pain signals, by suppression of the release of CGRP and SP from the nerve terminals. The protective effects on cardiovascular system mediated by CGRP and SP can be inhibited, if the same effect is produced by the action of opioids in the peripheral nerve terminals innervating the heart and the vasculature. Our previous research shows that intrathecal administration of morphine or epidural administration of ropivacaine (1%, in 20 \u03bcL) significantly attenuates the increases of CGRP and its coding mRNA in ventricular myocardium and the innervating dorsal root ganglion neurons following occlusion of coronary artery in experimental animals. We design this study to investigate the potential adverse effect of anesthesia with opioid as the main analgesic.",
    "detailed_description": "We hypothesize that over-analgesia using opioids significantly suppresses the activity of TRPV1/CGRP and SP and reduces the amount of CGRP and SP released, which results in an effective de-protection of the cardiovascular system. The severer myocardial damage under some insulting circumstances and eventful systemic hemodynamics is likely occurring upon some surgical/pathological/pharmacological insults in the intra- and postoperative periods.\n\nThis parallel, randomized controlled trial will be conducted in eleven centers in Shanxi province, China, which is designed to investigate the perioperative incidence of adverse cardiovascular events and alteration of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in the patients (one thousand patients, ASA Physical Status 1-II, older than 16 years, regardless of the gender) undergoing surgery under total intravenous general anesthesia with conventional \u00b5-opioid agonists or Esketamine, as the major analgesic. Clinically appropriate anesthesia depth or BIS readings will be used for judgement of anesthetic depth. Conventional monitoring parameters, including blood pressures, heart rate, SpO2 and ECG, will be recorded and analyzed. Blood samples will be collected at 30 min before induction of anesthesia, at the end of surgery and 24 h after the surgery. The association of the perioperative adverse cardiovascular events and the alterations of the levels of serum TRPV1, CGRP, SP and cTnI in the patients underwent general anesthesia using different analgesics (\u00b5-opioid agonists vs Esketamine) will be evaluated. Postoperative outcome, including the functions of the brain and cardiovascular system, is also going to be traced for 1 year postoperatively.",

Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator. It works by blocking the effects of the hormone estrogen in the breast. Tamoxifen is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for prevention of breast cancer in women at increased risk. Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to decrease the amount of fats made in the liver. Omega-3 fatty acids may work to prevent cancer in overweight or obese individuals. Tamoxifen with or without omega-3 fatty acids may be effective at reducing risk of breast cancer among women who are postmenopausal, overweight or obese, and at increased risk.",

Blood, adipose and stool are sampled at three timepoints; baseline, peak weight (4 weeks) and post weight loss to monitor changes in cellular processes. Additionally, direct insulin sensitivity testing, and radiological measurement of visceral fat and intrahepatic fat content is measured at three timepoints to correlate clinical indices with cellular changes.",
    "detailed_description": "Obesity has become an epidemic worldwide. Metabolic/cardiovascular complications of obesity are likely related to the fact that obese individuals tend to be insulin resistant (IR). While insulin- mediated glucose uptake (IMGU) correlates with adipose tissue mass, not all obese individuals are IR, and metabolic and cardiovascular profiles of those who are IR vs insulin sensitive (IS) differ significantly. Why one individual who reaches a BMI of 30 kg/m2 will develop IR and another with similar BMI and activity level remains IS is unclear. Furthermore, while insulin sensitivity improves with weight loss, this response varies as well. Given that fat mass per se does not fully explain the obesity contribution to IMGU, itis likely that differential adipocyte function plays a role. With this study, our purpose is to employ an integrated omics strategy to identify analyte/pathway signatures in blood and adipose tissue that characterize IR versus IS states and expand our biological knowledge of the mechanisms underlying IR.",

Then, 300 toddlers (aged 7-71 months) and 300 infants (aged 2-6 months) will be eligible for parallel enrollment after assessing through medical history and physical examination. Subjects from each age group will be randomly assigned to the vaccine group or placebo group in a ratio of 3:1, that is, 225 subjects of all age groups will be injected with the vaccine while 75 subjects with the placebo.\n\nToddlers (aged 7-71 months) will receive an injection of the vaccine or placebo in the anterolateral midthigh or deltoid muscle of the upper arm on Day 0 and 28. Infants (aged 2-6 months) will receive an injection of the vaccine or placebo in the anterolateral midthigh or deltoid muscle of the upper arm on Day 0, 28, and 56. There would be 140 subjects in each age group chosen voluntarily for the immune persistence cohort according to the order of enrollment. The duration of toddlers (aged 7-71 months) for intervention is approximately 1 month. Thus, the duration of each subject enrolled in the immune persistence cohort will be approximately 13 months while the duration of the rest of the subjects in the study will be approximately 7 months. The duration of infants (aged 2-6 months) for intervention is approximately 2 months. Thus, the duration of each subject enrolled in the immune persistence cohort will be approximately 14 months while the duration of the rest of the subjects in the study will be approximately 8 months.\n\nFor safety assessment, the observation and evaluation of adverse events (AE) from Day 0 to Days 28/30 after each dose, and serious adverse events (SAE) between the first dose up to 6 months after the final dose will be evaluated by diary/contact cards, active reports by subjects' legal guardians, or investigators' phone calls as well as face-to-face visits.

    "detailed_description": "Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide. The causative agent responsible for cervical cancer is the persistent infection with oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Rates of cervical cancer and HPV infection are increased particularly in HIV-infected women due to immunosuppression with cervical cancer categorized as an AIDS-defining diagnosis. Despite the promise of HPV vaccine in the prevention of cervical cancer, the widespread availability of this vaccine is limited due to cost and accessibility. Therefore, prevention strategies to reduce the risk of cervical cancer after HPV exposure entail treatment at the premalignant state, including low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), along with the eradication of HPV infection. There is a desperate need for an inexpensive, non-invasive alternative method to treat these premalignant cervical lesions and potentially suppress HPV infection.\n\nCurcumin, an extract from turmeric, a popular culinary spice, has been used in traditional Indian medicine for its anti-inflammatory and anti-infectious properties. Recent studies have shown the potential effect of curcumin to reduce tumors and precancerous lesions in animal and human cancer cells. It is postulated that curcumin achieves its effect on cancer cells by modulating different cellular pathways as well as altering HPV effect on tissue cells.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to see if curcumin can suppress HPV infection in women with LSIL disease or treated HSIL disease. The researchers plan to explore the effect of curcumin as a potential medical treatment in HIV-uninfected and infected women with mild precancerous lesions of the cervix or recently treated high-grade precancerous lesions at risk for persistent HPV infection.

The study aims to identify factors that drive progression to disease and study signals (markers of the immune response) that detect who will progress to active TB and why this happens. Armed with these markers, the study will address how malnutrition and worms alter this signal profile to cause active TB. The work will be conducted in India, where there are 2.8 million TB cases each year - more than any other country - and where the government has committed to eliminating TB by 2035. Data suggest that malnutrition and parasites increase risk of TB disease so the investigators will feed malnourished household contacts and have those with parasites receive medication to treat these. Using this infrastructure, the investigators will evaluate the immunologic impact of feeding on TB pathogenesis. An additional aim is to understand the role of parasitic worms with the goal of determining the utility of low-cost ($.02 per dose) worm treatment as part of TB control efforts. Risk of developing TB will be evaluated for 120 household contacts of TB patients in the setting of their malnutrition and parasites. There are four study arms comprised of thirty participants each -- malnourished with parasite infection, malnourished with no parasite infection, well-nourished with parasite infection, and well-nourished with no parasite infection. Correlates of risk of disease will be assessed using blood messenger RNA/micro RNA (mRNA/miRNA) sequencing and T cell immune markers. The TB LION study will confirm that malnutrition and worms increase the risk of active TB and will provide the basis for effective interventions that could change the face of the TB pandemic and have a profound impact on the health of people worldwide. Participants in this study will be household contacts of tuberculosis index cases. The index cases in this study do not participate in the study once a household contact is established. All interventions and follow up are only being conducted within the household contact cohort. All intervention supplies, treatments, and biologics will be purchased internationally.",

Resistance training will be a 16-week supervised workout that will consist of a series of resistance exercises (leg press, knee extension, knee bends, chest press, sit-ups, back extensions, pull-ups, and shoulder press) that involved the largest muscle groups of the body and will be performed three times a week on non-consecutive days. Both the RG and the RCG will receive a supplement of soluble protein powder (20-30 g) daily.\n\nDiscussion: The results of this intervention will help to better understand the potential of non-pharmacological treatment for improving strength and wellbeing values in breast cancer patients with and without creatine supplementation.",

    "brief_summary": "The investigators are studying the effects of exposure to diesel exhaust on lung inflammation in the presence and absence of an inhaled corticosteroid. Although data is mixed, studies show that asthmatics have increased lung inflammation and worse symptoms during periods of higher air pollution despite taking their anti-inflammatory corticosteroid medication. One possible reason is that air pollution exposure may decrease the ability of corticosteroids to combat inflammation.\n\nTo test this volunteers will inhale either a placebo or a corticosteroid, before sitting in an exposure booth for 2 hours breathing either filtered air or diluted diesel exhaust. Samples will be collected before and after exposure to analyze the effects of budesonide and diesel exhaust exposure.",
    "detailed_description": "1) Purpose Inhalation of air pollutants leads to both airway inflammation, with increased cytokine expression and inflammatory cell recruitment to the airways, and to airway hyperresponsiveness, which together contribute to airway resistance and breathing difficulties. Correlational data indicate that exposure to air pollution increases inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) use in asthmatics, suggesting that steroidal anti-inflammatory medications are suboptimally effective under these conditions. However, a major issue is that no study has yet been performed specifically to determine the effects of controlled diesel exhaust (DE) exposure on responses to ICS. Furthermore, investigators need better insight into mechanisms, including the effects of epigenetic modifications and polymorphisms in oxidative stress response genes, which remain under explored. Investigators anticipate that an improved understanding of air pollution-induced ICS hyporesponsiveness (reduced effectiveness) could underpin preventative guidelines, guide ICS usage in response to environmental exposures, and inform rational pharmaceutical development. Ultimately this could lead to fewer exacerbations in asthmatic and other susceptible populations.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nAcute exposure to DE reduces ICS-inducible gene expression in vivo in asthmatics, in part through effects on epigenetic processes.\n\nJustification:\n\nAir pollution exposure correlates with increased use of ICS inhalers in asthmatics, suggesting that ICS offer less control during periods of higher air pollution. As genes induced by ICS are critical in reducing inflammatory messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expression, the investigators have chosen to focus on the effects of DE on ICS-inducible gene expression as our primary endpoint.\n\nResearch Method:\n\nTo test this the effects of air pollution exposure on a corticosteroid, volunteers will inhale either a placebo (inhaler containing no medication) or budesonide (1.6mg), before sitting in our exposure booth for 2 hours breathing either filtered air (as a control) or diluted diesel exhaust (standardized to 300\u00b5g/m\u00b3 of particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less).\n\nVolunteers will visit our lab four different times to be exposed to: 1) placebo \\& filtered air, 2) placebo \\& diesel exhaust, 3) corticosteroid and filtered air, and 4) corticosteroid and diesel exhaust. Investigators can then compare responses to each of these combinations of exposures.\n\nInvestigators will take blood samples before and after volunteers complete each of these exposures to track how they affect the body. Six hours after placebo or budesonide inhalation a research bronchoscopy will be performed during which a very thin flexible tube will be inserted through the mouth and down into lungs to collect samples from each volunteer.\n\nBronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial washes, bronchial brushes and tissue biopsies will be obtained for analysis of gene expression and epigenetic endpoints. Nasal lavage samples will also be collected to examine responses in the upper airways and blood and urine will be studied to examine systemic responses. Spirometry will be used to assess effects on airway function.",

    "brief_summary": "Warts are a common viral infection of the skin and are prevalent throughout the world, with an overall prevalence in the United States estimated at 2-20%. The incidence of anogenital warts occurs more frequently in HIV-infected patients, with a seven-fold increase in risk compared to patients without HIV infection. Available treatments for anogenital warts can only reduce, but cannot eradicate, HPV infection. There are many therapeutic options for treating anogenital warts, but none can prevent recurrence. Immunotherapy has become one of the best therapeutic options for warts caused by HPV infection because it increases the immune response to HPV infection, resulting in remission, both in lesions that receive direct and indirect intralesional therapy. Immunotherapy, acts as a basic principle to enhance cell-mediated immunity for wart clearance. Apart from low recurrence, regression in immunotherapy for warts due to HPV infection generally occurs without cicatrices, so it is a consideration in choosing therapy, including anogenital warts. Various types of immunotherapy have been used, one of which is purified protein derivative, which can be used as an alternative therapy option for anogenital warts. In a previous case report, even though an HIV patient had an abnormal immune system, tuberculin protein purified derivative therapy, immunotherapy provided a significant clinical response in the form of a reduction in lesion size, compared to patients who were not given therapy. Research regarding the comparison of the response to tuberculin protein purified derivative therapy in anogenital warts patients with and without HIV infection has never been reported. Therefore, researchers are interested in examining the comparison of the response to tuberculin purified protein derivative therapy in anogenital warts patients between those with and without HIV infection and knowing the comparison of local and systemic cytokine changes when administering anogenital wart therapy with tuberculin protein purified derivative between those with and without HIV infection.",

    "detailed_description": "Hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (hPAP) is a rare lung disease characterized by the progressive accumulation of pulmonary surfactant in alveoli resulting in progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure, and in some patients, secondary infections and/or pulmonary fibrosis. While hPAP affects men, women, and children, most patients present as children. The lung structure appears well-preserved in many cases with pathogenesis being driven by the consequences of the filling of alveoli with surfactant sediment; however, some patients develop respiratory failure caused by pulmonary fibrosis requiring therapeutic lung transplantation.\n\nHereditary PAP is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the genes (CSF2RA or CSF2RB) encoding the GM-CSF receptor alpha or beta chains, respectively. Mutations in these genes disrupt GM-CSF receptor function, blocking GM-CSF signaling and impairing the removal of excess surfactant from alveoli by alveolar macrophages (AMs).\n\nThis study is an open-label, non-randomized, single center clinical treatment study to evaluate the feasibility of manufacturing CSF2RA gene-corrected macrophages, as well as the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and durability of CSF2RA gene correction/pulmonary macrophage transplantation (PMT) therapy in three patients with hPAP caused by recessive homozygous or compound heterozygous CSF2RA mutations. In addition to safety and tolerability, the clinical trial will evaluate outcome measures related to clinical efficacy and biologic signature of CSF2RA gene-correction/PMT therapy, as well as pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and the mechanism of action.\n\nThe clinical trial design includes a 2-month observation period, a Baseline visit, 5-month treatment period, and Short-, Medium-, and Long-Term follow-up periods of 1, 4, and 10 years, respectively. Each patient will serve as their own self-control and receive a split-dose comprising three administrations of autologous, bone marrow cluster of differentiation 34+ (CD34+) cell-derived, lentiviral CSF2RA gene-corrected macrophages at a minimum of 2-month intervals, delivered by direct bronchoscopic instillation of cells into individual lung segments (5.8x105 cells/segment); an increasing number of cells at each administration will be achieved by sequentially increasing the number of segments treated. Current standard medical care (whole lung lavage and supplemental oxygen) will be continuously available to all enrolled patients.\n\nAssessments will include safety (adverse events and serious adverse events), tolerability (short-term, treatment-emergent pulmonary symptoms), efficacy (beneficial effects on clinical, physiological, and radiological manifestations of hPAP), durability (persistence of beneficial effects), and mechanism of action (persistence, CSF2RA-expression, and function of alveolar macrophages (AMs)).\n\nExpected results will inform the feasibility, safety, tolerability, efficacy, durability, and mechanism of action of gene transfer/PMT as therapy of hPAP. These results will impact the field because it departs markedly from the current inefficient, highly invasive method of physically removing surfactant by whole lung lavage (WLL) and instead uses a novel approach to restore AM function. This study is expected to establish the feasibility of a novel, specific therapy for children with hPAP and a new type of cell transplantation therapy (PMT) that may be useful for other diseases.",

Existing targeted drugs with tolerable toxicity profiles are used to investigate the therapeutic value beyond their approved indication, which are deemed beneficial in the select group of patients with a relevant predominantly active functional STP, in order to improve survival and maintain quality of life.",
    "detailed_description": "Rationale: Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal cancers in the world. Standard therapy consists of debulking surgery and chemotherapy. However, despite this aggressive treatment, recurrent disease almost invariably occurs resulting in a five-year survival rate of approximately 30%. Tumour growth is driven by several signal transduction pathways (STPs), and twelve major STPs have been identified as important for carcinogenesis. Currently, several targeted therapy drugs are available and new targeted drugs are being developed. With a newly developed technique, Signal Transduction Activation (STA) analysis, it is possible to assess which pathway is predominant in a specific (ovarian) cancer sample. Therefore, we hypothesize that specifically targeting the predominant STP might impair tumour growth and improve survival.\n\nObjective: This study aims to investigate the progression-free survival (PFS) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria on matched targeted therapy by STA-analysis (PFS2) in comparison to the PFS recorded on the therapy administered immediately prior to enrolment (PFS1) in women with recurrent ovarian cancer.\n\nStudy design: A multi-centre prospective, parallel-group, cohort study. Study population: Recurrent ovarian cancer patients with platinum-resistant disease, patients who refrain from standard therapy and patients who are not yet eligible for standard palliative chemotherapy, including all histological subtypes.\n\nIntervention: STA-analysis will be performed on a biopsy taken from the recurrent tumour. Patients will be included if a predominant pathway is identified for which a matched targeted drug is available and deemed adequate by the multidisciplinary tumour board. We will start with targeted therapy in patients with oestrogen receptor, androgen receptor, phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Hedgehog pathway active tumours, since targeted therapy interceding these pathways are easily available with tolerable side effects.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is therapy response defined as PFS2/PFS1 ratio according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with an actionable active pathway and the proportion of patients receiving matched targeted therapy, best overall response (according to RECIST 1.1 criteria), one-year survival, overall survival, predictive value of STA-analysis results, side effects, quality of life, cost-effectiveness and change in STP activity score comparing the score before treatment and after disease progression.",

All participants need to be HLA-A2.1 positive.",
    "detailed_description": "Rationale of this study:\n\nEx vivo generated and tumor-antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DC) are currently used in clinical vaccination protocols in cancer patients. DC vaccines are safe, with minimal side effects. Evaluating more than 200 patients treated the past ten years we found that clinical responses measured in several patients directly coincide with specific cytotoxic T cell responses. The majority of studies investigated the therapeutic effects of DC vaccines in late-stage cancer patients with metastasis. In these (heavily) pretreated patients the immune system is compromised. Based on our observations that a specific immune response is indicative for a good clinical outcome we believe that the full potential of these immunostimulatory cells has to be exploited in high-risk patients with low tumor burden or in a precancerous state.\n\nA good clinical model are carriers of a germline mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, such as patients with Lynch syndrome (also known as Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer or HNPCC). These persons have a lifetime risk of 60-80% for colorectal cancer that has developed within a few years from a precancerous adenoma. The immune system is thought to be of potential great importance as the colorectal cancer in Lynch syndrome is characterized by a strong lymphocyte infiltration, even at the stage of adenomas. In affected cancer lesions, MMR dysfunction results in frameshift mutations at short, repetitive DNA sequences referred to as microsatellites. In coding regions these mutations destroy gene function and have been demonstrated to lead to the production of neopeptides. These neopeptides are: 1) tumor specific, because frameshift mutations only occur in tumor cells and their premalignant progenitors, 2) are very similar between patients, since the same genes are affected by the mismatch repair defect and 3) immunogenic, since cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and helper T cells could be induced in vitro from blood of patients with Lynch syndrome. Similar mechanisms occur in sporadic colon cancer with MMR dysfunction, which represents about 10-15% of all colorectal 2.\n\nObjectives:\n\nIn this Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre (RUNMC) initiated study our first objective is to investigate toxicity (safety and feasibility) of vaccination with frameshift-derived neoantigen-loaded DC of CRC patients with an MSI-positive CRC and persons who are known to be carrier of a germline MMR-gene mutation with no signs of disease yet.\n\nThe secondary objectives of the study are to demonstrate that peptide-loaded DC can induce or enhance an immune response to tumor-associated antigen CEA and specific frameshift-derived neoantigens in the study population. And we want to study the pathological and clinical responses, e.g. disease-free survival, determined according to the standard protocol.\n\nStudy design:\n\nThis study is a phase I/II open-label study.\n\nStudy population:\n\nTwo groups of adults will be vaccinated:\n\nGroup I) CRC patients, who are known to carry a germline MMR-gene mutation and patients with an MSI-positive CRC and yet unknown or negative MMR-gene mutation status.\n\nGroup II) persons who are known to be carrier of a germline MMR-gene mutation with no signs of disease yet. All participants need to be HLA-A2.1 positive.\n\nMain study endpoints:\n\nThe first objective of this study is to toxicity (safety and feasibility) of vaccination with frameshift-derived neoantigen-loaded DC. This will be measured by recording of the adverse events according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.\n\nThe secondary objectives of the study are to demonstrate that peptide-loaded DC can induce or enhance an immune response to tumor-associated antigen CEA and specific frameshift-derived neoantigens in the study population. Immune responses will be assessed as:\n\n* proliferative and humoral response to KLH\n* cytokine production of KLH stimulated PBMC\n* tumor antigen-specific T cell responses in peripheral blood\n* tumor antigen-specific T cell responses in biopsies from DTH\n* cytokine production of T cells in biopsies from DTH\n* cytotoxicity of T cells in biopsies from DTH\n* immunohistochemical characterization of DTH infiltrating lymphocytes\n\nThe pathological and clinical responses, e.g. disease-free survival, will be determined according to the standard protocol.",

    "brief_summary": "Childhood aggressive gliomas are rare brain tumors with very poor prognosis. Due to the tumor's location and infiltrative nature, surgical removal is not always possible, and even when resection is performed and combined with chemo- and/or radiotherapy, tumor cells frequently persist, eventually giving rise to tumor recurrence. A promising strategy to eradicate persisting tumor cells is vaccination with dendritic cells (DC). DC are immune cells that play an important role in organizing the body's defense against cancer. The goal of DC vaccination is to activate these natural anti-tumor defense mechanisms to delay or prevent tumor progression or recurrence. Previous clinical studies have demonstrated that DC vaccination is well-tolerated, safe and capable of eliciting tumorspecific immunity.\n\nA clinical study including 10 pediatric patients (aged \u2265 12 months and \\< 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent) with brain (stem) tumors is initiated at the Antwerp University Hospital to investigate intradermal vaccination with WT1 mRNA-loaded autologous monocyte-derived DCs, either combined with first-line chemoradiation treatment or administered as adjuvant therapy following previous therapies. The general objective of this phase I/II clinical study is (1) to demonstrate that WT1-targeted DC vaccine production and administration in pediatric patients with HGG and DIPG, either combined with first-line chemoradiation treatment or administered as adjuvant therapy following previous therapies, is feasible and safe, (2) to study vaccine-induced immune responses, (3) to document patients' quality of life and clinical outcome for comparison with current patients' outcome allowing indication of the added value.",
    "detailed_description": "1. Overview of the study treatment scheme\n\n   1.1 Newly diagnosed HGG and DIPG patients (stratum A)\n\n   Patients will be screened and registered in the study following diagnosis, which is based on either histological confirmation or radiographic criteria. Maximal safe resection prior to study entry is strongly recommended, but not required.\n\n   Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis prior to temozolomide-based chemoradiation and subsequent chemo-immunotherapy with maintenance temozolomide and autologous WT1 mRNA-loaded DC vaccination. Chemoradiation with subsequent maintenance temozolomide is considered best available treatment and therefore not considered investigational. The investigational treatment, i.e. adjuvant DC vaccination, is administered in 2 phases:\n   * an induction phase, consisting of 3 weekly (-1 day, +2 days) DC vaccines, which is initiated after chemoradiation, but before maintenance temozolomide therapy, and\n   * a booster phase, consisting of 6 4-weekly (\u00b13 days) DC vaccines, which are administered during temozolomide maintenance cycles.\n\n   1.2 Non-treatment na\u00efve HGG and DIPG patients (stratum B)\n\n   Patients who have undergone previous anti-glioma treatments can be included in the study, provided they are eligible according to the in- and exclusion criteria.\n\n   The decision to start, continue or re-initiate conventional anti-glioma treatment, including radio- and/or chemotherapy, and, if applicable, the treatment dose and scheme, are at the Investigator's discretion. The backbone DC immunotherapy scheme for the induction and booster phase will be maintained with minor modifications:\n   * during the induction phase, 3 DC vaccines will be administered on a weekly (-1 day, +2 days) basis\n   * during the booster phase, 6 DC vaccines will be administered at regular intervals. It is recommended that the time between subsequent vaccinations is no longer than 4 weeks\n\n   1.3 Continuation of DC vaccination\n\n   While the study treatment schedule consists of 9 DC vaccinations (i.e. 3 induction and 6 booster vaccines), continuation of DC vaccination after the booster phase is allowed, on the conditions that (1) the Investigator judges that the participant's clinical situation justifies additional vaccinations, (2) consent for continuation of DC vaccination of the parents/guardian and the participant (if aged 12 years or older) has been obtained, and (3) residual vaccine aliquots are available.\n2. Response assessment\n\n   Disease evolution will be assessed radiologically according to the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. In addition, blood samples will be collected for immunomonitoring purposes on the day of the first, fourth and seventh DC vaccine. Tumor resection or biopsy specimens, if available, will be used for local immunological and biomarker analysis. At regular time points throughout the study scheme, parents and participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires on general and disease-specific quality-of-life, as well as on executive function.\n3. Follow-up\n\nPatients will be followed-up until 90 days after administration of the final DC vaccine or 24 months after study entry, whichever occurs later.",

Participants potentially eligible to participate in the clinical trial will be offered to sign a ICF three times prior to TILs treatment: 1) to allow for collection of archival FFPE tissue samples for determination PD1 by mRNA (Part #1), 2) prior to a fresh metastatic biopsy for selection, isolation and partial expansion of PD1+ TILs (Part #2) and 3) prior to allow for remaining study procedures and TILs therapy (Part #3, Main Consent).",
    "detailed_description": "This trial has been developed in TNBC, a breast cancer subtype with a particularly poor prognosis. The product used for treating participating patients will be selected PD1-positive TILs. Such TILs will be manufactured in Hospital Clinic under the name of NUMARZU-001. The procotol has been designed in three parts to better select participating patients. Molecular pre-screening has been established to select tumors with a higher probability of enrichment by PD1-positive TILs. The pre- screening consists of performing a tumor biopsy and selecting isolation and expansion of PD1- postive TILs to manufacture the final product NUMARZU-001. This part could last almost four weeks, as such patients will continue with the established treatment in the meanwhile. Finally, NUMARZU-001 will be administered if the patient is eligible for part three of the protocol.",

    "brief_summary": "The goal of the proposed study is to understand the reasons for the variability in aerobic exercise (AE) training benefits on the vasculature in middle-age and older (MA/O) adults, including differences between men and women. To achieve this goal, a mechanistic randomized controlled (RCT) will be conducted, in which adults are randomized to 12-weeks intervention of AE or no-exercise Control. Our overall hypothesis is that the exercise response variation in vascular benefits is related to age and sex differences in the biological changes underlying vascular aging and/or the molecular transducers (i.e., circulating molecules) that communicate and coordinate the effects of AE on the vasculature in the periphery and brain. Because this is a mechanistic trial, the overall goal is not a single health-related outcome. Rather, the goal is to advance our understanding of the molecular signals and pathways underlying the systemic and local effects of AE on vascular health that may explain the variability in AE responses with age and sex. This knowledge will allow for the development of personalized age- and sex-specific AE recommendations, and/or provide insights into molecular targets that can be manipulated to enhance and/or mimic exercise in non-responders or in persons unable to exercise.",

    "brief_summary": "Heart Failure (HF) is a significant health concern, affecting around 1-2% of people in Western countries. The risk of developing HF during a lifetime is about 20%. Despite advancements in HF care, the one-year mortality rate for HF patients remains high. HF patients also experience reduced physical capacity and quality of life. The heart relies heavily on a process called oxidative metabolism for energy, and this process requires a continuous supply of energy sources like fatty acids, glucose, and ketone bodies. In HF, there's a shift in how the heart uses these energy sources, which affects its efficiency.\n\nKetone bodies such as 3-OHB, are molecules that can provide the heart with a more efficient energy source compared to traditional ones like fatty acids or glucose. They are produced in the liver and are important for supplying energy during fasting, exercise, and illness. Recent research suggests that 3-OHB might have benefits for HF patients beyond just providing energy. It seems to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the heart. Some studies in healthy individuals have shown that infusing 3-OHB increases blood flow to the heart.\n\nIn HF patients, the investigators aim to explore the cardiac effects of a two-week supplement of 3-OHB. The aim is to investigate if this supplement can increase the heart's consumption and utilization of 3-OHB. The study involves 12 patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The patients will receive a ketone ester supplement four times a day for two weeks, and then they'll take an isocaloric placebo supplement for another two weeks.\n\nThe investigators will use positron emission tomography (PET) to study the cardiac oxygen consumption and 3-OHB uptake. This is done by injection of tracers (11-C-3-OHB and 11-C-acetate).\n\nThe study will also look at myocardial external efficiency (MEE) and myocardial blood flow (MBF). For a subset of participants, the investigators will also take myocardial biopsies and perform more detailed analyses, e.g. respirometry and electron microscopy or single nucleus mRNA sequencing, proteomics and metabolimcs, to understand the impact of the supplement on the heart's cellular structures and functions, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome.\n\nUltimately, this study aims to determine whether supplementing HF patients with 3-OHB can improve the heart's energy usage and potentially provide other beneficial effects. This research might pave the way for new treatments that enhance the heart's function and quality of life for HF patients.",

    "detailed_description": "Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are a very heterogeneous group of heart diseases in terms of embryonic mechanisms, phenotypes and aetiologies. In isolated forms, genetic causes are identified in only 19% of cases, linked to chromosomal abnormalities (8%) or gene variants (11%). Environmental causes such as infection, exposure to toxic substances or ingestion of teratogenic substances may also favour the onset of MCC. Although in the majority of cases the aetiology remains unknown, the discovery of MCC in the ante-natal period almost systematically leads to a genetic aetiological work-up using amniotic fluid for karyotype, Array-CGH and, more recently, exome analysis. With regard to environmental causes, recent data in the literature report a link between environmental exposures (occupational, extra-occupational or medicinal) and congenital anomalies.\n\nObjectives: The low percentage of genetic abnormalities and toxic factors identified as causal in patients with non-syndromic CHD prompts a search for more complex causes such as epigenetic modifications linked to an interaction between genes and environmental factors.\n\nMethods: The multi-omics study approach, using high-throughput sequencing technologies (exome, RNASeq, methylSeq), provides a wealth of information on cellular and/or tissue signaling pathways in response to exposure. Integrated analysis of transcriptomes and methylomes has demonstrated the occurrence of combined defects in gene expression and methylation following toxic exposure. The period of CHD formation during embryonic development prompts us to look for epigenetic modifications during prenatal period, as close as possible to the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to this malformation.\n\nExpected results: the multi-omics analysis applied to fetuses with non-syndromic complex CHD, combined with the characterization of occupational and non-occupational environmental exposures, will enable us to extend the etiological search for these malformations, to identify biomarkers linked to the occurrence and severity of these malformations and gain a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms linked to CHD.\n\nIn the longer term, this study will serve as a basis for large-scale studies to enable the development of prevention policies, based on exhaustive, multicenter cohorts. In addition, multi-omics studies could identify gene markers, by exome, transcriptome and/or methylome, which could then be studied in a targeted manner.",

    "detailed_description": "Granulocytes are a key actor of immune response during acute viral or bacterial infection. During their maturation in bone marrow they went from immature form to mature form. In physiological condition only mature form are present in blood. However, in case of acute viral or bacterial infection, immature granulocytes (CD10low/CD16low) could be released in blood. But concentration, phenotype and function of these IG seems to be different between bacterial and viral infection. Indeed, in bacterial infection, concentration of IG is high (\\> 20%) and they expressed CD64 and CD123. In case of viral infection, blood concentration of IG is lower and they expressed CD62-L. These phenotype differences are probably associated with functional modification. A more precise characterization of the phenotype and functions of IG according to the stimulus (bacterial or viral) could provide a better understanding of the innate immune response in patients hospitalized in ICU for acute infection. The investigators will analysis by flow cytometry IG subsets (PDL1 CD62L LOX-1 CD45 CD64 CD15 CD123 CD16 CD10 CRTH2) of adult immunocompetent patient hospitalized in ICU for less than 24 hours for acute infection. Transcriptomic and cytokine analysis will be also performed.

    "detailed_description": "Melanoma represents a considerable health burden and an ongoing area of unmet need in oncology. Despite melanoma accounts for only 1% of diagnosed skin cancers, it is the cause of most skin cancer-related deaths. Until recently, limited effective treatment options were available to patients with advanced melanoma. Historically, response rates to conventional chemotherapy and immunomodulation therapy (interleukin-2 or interferon-\u03b3) have been reported at approximately 5-19%.\n\nAdjuvant immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and target therapy improve outcomes of patients with high-risk resectable melanoma. It has recently been demonstrated that treatment with neoadjuvant and adjuvant targeted therapy (dabrafenib and trametinib) is associated with a high pathologic complete response (pCR) rate and improved outcomes over surgery alone. However, treatment with ICB has not been well studied in the neoadjuvant setting, despite preclinical studies suggesting that neoadjuvant administration of ICB is associated with improved survival and enhanced anti-tumour immune responses compared to the same therapy administered in the adjuvant setting.\n\nThe advantage of neoadjuvant trials is the availability of blood and tumour tissue samples before and after systemic therapy for the conduct of novel mechanistic and biomarker studies in the circulation and the tumour microenvironment.\n\nProspective neoadjuvant clinical trials with targeted (dabrafenib/trametinib combo) or immunotherapeutic agents (nivolumab alone or nivolumab/ipilimumab combo) and combinations are now running in a subgroup of highrisk melanoma patients with pooled overall promising preliminary results of high rates of pathologic complete responses (pCRs, 30-50%) and early data of positive correlation between pCR and relapse-free survival. Based on the available results to date, we aim to conduct a randomized, noncomparative phase II trial to define the role of neoadjuvant plus adjuvant target and immunotherapy, given in combination or sequence, in patients with high risk surgically resectable melanoma.This approach has the potential to define whether neoadjuvant treatment has antitumour activity and whether it reduces the risk of relapse after surgery.",

HD is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative condition caused by a mutation in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, resulting in excessive production of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein, which damages nerve cells and leads to progressive motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms.\n\nSKY-0515 is designed to reduce mHTT protein levels by lowering of HTT messenger RNA (mRNA) through a splicing mechanism, leading to a decrease in both wild-type and mutant forms of HTT protein. Additionally, the drug lowers postmeiotic segregation 1 (PMS1) protein, which plays a role in somatic CAG repeat expansion-a key driver of HD progression. In early studies, SKY-0515 has reduced HTT and PMS1 mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner, with favorable safety and tolerability profiles in healthy volunteers.\n\nThis study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial conducted at multiple sites. Participants must be aged 25 or older, have genetically confirmed HD (CAG repeat length \u2265 40), and meet specific functional and motor criteria.

Screening Period (up to 4 weeks): Participants will undergo eligibility assessments.\n2. Double-Blind Treatment Period (12 months): Participants will take SKY-0515 or a placebo once daily and undergo regular clinic visits for monitoring. Safety and efficacy will be evaluated through blood tests, imaging (MRI), and clinical assessments, including the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS).\n3. Follow-Up Period (4 weeks): After completing treatment, participants will be monitored for any remaining effects.\n\nAn independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will oversee the trial to ensure participant safety.\n\nThis study will assess:\n\n* Changes in levels of HTT proteins and other HD-related biomarkers.\n* Effects on HD-related brain atrophy and clinical features.\n* Long-term safety of SKY-0515.",

    "brief_summary": "ESSURE\u00ae is an implantable medical device for definitive and irreversible sterilization indicated for adult women of childbearing age. These implants are inserted into the fallopian tubes by hysteroscopy. Marketed in 2002, ESSURE\u00ae contraceptive implants were withdrawn from the French market in 2017 (and worldwide in 2017 and 2018) following the observation in certain patients of polymorphic and non-specific gynecological and extra-gynecological symptoms. Studies with small numbers and short-term follow-up have shown a significant improvement in these symptoms after implant explantation. This constitutes a real public health problem since according to the report of the EPI-PHARE Scientific Interest Group, 198,000 French women have these implants and only 30,000 of them, or 15%, have been explanted, knowing that explantation of ESSURE\u00ae implants is recommended only in symptomatic patients. A large number of these patients, presenting symptoms, have not yet been treated for an explant.\n\nThe physiopathological mechanism(s) is (are) not yet determined but several arguments are in favor of a dissemination of metallic elements contained in these implants whose accumulation could lead to inflammatory and/or allergic and/or autoimmune phenomena.\n\nCarrying out a prospective study with long-term longitudinal follow-up appears essential to precisely assess the degree of improvement in the symptoms and quality of life of these patients, determine the most appropriate surgical techniques, and understand the pathophysiological mechanisms that may result in the implementation of specific treatments and relevant markers. From a surgical point of view, there is a real risk of fracture of implants whatever the type of intervention performed: study the biomechanical properties of implants with a view to characterizing their behavior to mechanical rupture but also their thermal resistance in an objective manner seems essential to limit the risk of fracture and help to inform the patient about the surgical technique proposed for explantation. From a biological point of view, the dosage of the metallic elements constituting ESSURE\u00ae implants and potentially toxic ones could make it possible to objectify the release of these metallic elements in the body. Analysis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, micro-RNAs (miRNA), quantitative analysis of inflammatory pathway messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNAs) (NanoString technology) and analysis of neuroinflammation by functional imaging should make it possible to explore potential pathophysiological mechanisms. This study responds to a significant request from patient associations.",

There is a well demonstrated discrepancy in the repigmentation response between anatomical areas of the body. Face and neck are the best responder with complete or almost complete repigmentation achieved in most cases under treatment. Trunk and limbs could have a complete or almost complete repigmentation in approximately half of the cases. The repigmentation is much more difficult in wrists, elbows, knees, proximal part of the hands. Finally, some areas such as the extremities of hands and feet, palms, soles, are almost impossible to repigment.\n\nThe investigator hypothesize that there are some factors that are produced in the skin that prevent (or at least decrease) the differentiation but also probably the migration and proliferation of melanocytes.\n\nPrimary objective To compare the mRNA expression of each types of cells in the skin of vitiligo patients compared to healthy volunteers according to body locations",

    "brief_summary": "70% of Europeans will be exposed to a potentially traumatic event (PTE). Following this experience, people are likely to develop various psychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or a major depressive episode (MDE). However, not all subjects have the same risk to develop a pathology, and resilience capacities, which depend on multiple factors are difficult to predict. Currently, there are no objective tools to stratify exposed subjects according to their risk of developing pathological responses to stress, which leads to difficulties in allocating means of prevention and treatment.\n\nRecently, new biological hypotheses explaining vulnerability/resilience to stress and depression, implicating the GPR56 and ELK1 genes, have been described. Previous studies have shown that evaluation of the vulnerability risk can be obtained from clinical, cognitive, biological or brain imaging variables, but no study has integrated these different approaches. Therefore, the project presented here aims at integrating behavioral, biological and neuroimaging data to predict the development of psychiatric disease. In this study, a prospective cohort of 255 violent trauma victims will be set up in 3 French cities for a period of 2 years. Eligible subjects will be included in the month following PTE and will be followed longitudinally for 12 months. Evaluations at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months will be performed, during which the subject will complete various clinical and cognitive tests. A blood sample will be collected at each visit to study biological processes including the regulation of genetic and epigenetic expression, in particular the expression of the GPR56 and ELK1 genes in the blood. For eligible subjects a brain MRI will be proposed at the first visit.\n\nWe hypothesize that the genetic expression of ELK1 and GPR56 is predictive of the development of psychiatric pathologies at 6 and 12 months post-PTE. The ambition of this project is also to highlight the importance of a multimodal approach integrating a triad of markers (behavioral, biological and neuroimaging) to test this hypothesis.",

    "detailed_description": "Basket studies are a new sort of clinical studies to identify patients with the same kind of mutations and treat them with the same drug, irrespective of their specific cancer type. In basket studies, depending on the mutation types, patients are classified into \"baskets\". Targeted therapies that block that mutation are then identified and assigned to baskets where patients are treated accordingly.\n\nThis protocol has two parts: part A (iPROFILER), which includes the common procedures for tumor molecular profiling and treatment recommendation, and part B (iBASKET), which corresponds to the therapeutic portion.\n\nThe purpose of part A (iPROFILER) of this study is to test participants' tumour tissue in order to identify whether their tumour has certain mutations in cancer-related genes. It is known that gene mutations of tumours contribute to their origin and growth and determine whether the tumour will respond to particular cancer drugs. This test will provide information about potential targeted therapies that specifically attack those gene mutations. The purpose of part B (iBASKET) of this study is to offer participants a personalised anti-cancer treatment based on the gene mutations that are found in their tumour.\n\nParticipants taking part in module 1 of part B (iBASKET) will receive atezolizumab 1200 mg IV every 3 weeks, following the analysis of their tumour in part A (iPROFILER). Participants will be able to take atezolizumab for as long as their tumour doesn't grow and for as long as they don't have any side-effects which prevent them from continuing treatment. Module 1 will have a 2-year recruitment period. The aim of the study is to determine which genomically selected populations respond effectively to the targeted treatment, atezolizumab.

Participants will begin a light to moderate intensity exercise session consisting of brisk walking, alternating walk/jog, or light jog dependent upon the aerobic fitness level of the participant. The intensity of exercise will be adjusted by heart rate and/or the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) 6-20 scale such that heart rate is approximately 70% of age-adjusted maximal heart rate (220-age), a range between 120-140 beats per minute for most participants, at an RPE of 11 (light) - 13 (somewhat hard).

Participants assigned to the daily routine as usual group will be instructed to continue with their day as typical but to avoid exercise on the day of immunization.\n\nAll participants will be given a copy of the appropriate Vaccine Information Fact Sheet and three side effect report forms which list the side effects described in the Vaccine Information sheet. All participants will be asked to record side effects on the appropriate form every 24 hours for the first 72 hours after receiving the initial vaccine. Any concerning side effects are to be reported to study personnel, and the participants will be reminded to report such side effects to their health care provider.\n\nParticipants will be asked to return for blood collection seven days, approximately one month, and at three, six, and 12 months following vaccination.

The ex vivo functions of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 specific T cells specific for dominant epitopes will be evaluated by the assessment of intracellular cytokine production profiles using Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike peptide pools. Other peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be reserved for RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis. Gene expression will be assessed with RNA-Seq (single cell). The RNA-Seq data analysis will be performed by the Genome Informatics Facility (differential gene expression), GO and Kegg pathway analysis) for comparisons between exercise and control participants. Raman analysis will be used to assess metabolite profile in serum.\n\nThe frequency of antigen specific T cells expressing interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, or interleukin-2 or multi-cytokine producing cells, serum antibody and neutralizing antibody will be compared between exercise and control participants. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software will be used in analyses. As a secondary goal, discovery-based analysis to examine potential effects of psychosocial factors will be performed initially with bivariate analysis of survey scores and immune outcome measures (antibody and T cell cytokines). If a significant correlation between psychosocial survey score and an immune outcome measure is observed, additional follow up with regression model analyses to identify the extent to which separate factors contribute to a given immune outcome measure.",

A total of 134 patients with colorectalcancer will be included in the study.\n\nStudy outline:\n\nAfter initial inclusion the patient will undergo baseline testing with cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), then followed by an infusion of a weight dependent dosage of iron(III)isomaltoside or placebo. Then at the closest possible time to the surgery the patient will have drawn bloodwork and be re-tested by (CPET). The patient will be followed after surgery with evaluation of several outcomes including quality of recovery and complications. Further, the effects of the intervention on the patients immune function will be evaluated by two different methods: 1) by changes in neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio between baseline and preoperative bloodwork and 2) by evaluation mRNA expression in the tumor specimen by the Nanostring pancancer immune panel",
    "detailed_description": "Aim The aim is to investigate the effects of intravenously administered iron in non-anemic iron deficient patients on physical capacity, immunological cells and their function prior to surgery.\n\nStudy design The study will be performed as a double-blinded clinical randomized trial with a 1:1 recruitment ratio between placebo and the active group. The study will be performed as a multicenter study with inclusion at Department of Surgery, Zealand University Hospital, Departement of Surgery, Slagelse Hospital and Department of Surgery, Regionshospital Randers. The study will need 134 participants, 67 in each arm.\n\nPotential patients will be identified through routine blood samples taken prior to the first consultation. The samples will contain a complete anemia workup and a white blood cell count. The clinical guidelines for identifying and treating anemia in patients with colorectal cancer prior to surgery defines anemia by a hemoglobin \u2264 7 mmol/L for both men and women. Therefore non-anemic patients are defined by a hemoglobin above 7 mmol/L for both men and women in this protocol. Patients, who consents to the study, will immediately after the consultation be randomized and given weight dependent dose of Monofer\u00ae (Iron(III)-Isomaltoside) or placebo. On the day prior to surgery (or closest possible time) blood samples similar to the previous samples, will be taken, but with two additional blood samples, which will be stored for later analysis.\n\nAt the day of surgery, samples from the invasive front of the removed tumor will be taken and stored for later analysis by the Nanostring PanCancer Immune panel.\n\nThe first 20 patients from the Zealand University Hospital and Slagelse hospital will be physical tested by CPET prior to randomization and the day prior to surgery.\n\nAll patients will receive the same standardized peri- and postoperative care. All clinical decisions will be at the surgeon's discretion. On the days after surgery until discharge, daily routine blood samples will be taken, including white blood cell count and an assessment of the recovery, through the validated and translated questionnaire Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15). Discharge will be handled through standardized discharge criteria. After thirty days after surgery the patient will be contacted by phone for a follow up, concerning complications after discharge and medical records scrutinized for postoperative events.\n\nRandomization and allocation concealment Randomization to the intervention or placebo group will be handled through an online block randomization stratificatied by sex, center of treatment and hemoglobin levels at baseline. Hemoglobin levels at baseline will be divided into four groups: 7.1-8.0, 8.1-9.0, 9.1-10.0 and \u226510.1. Placebo or MonoFer (Iron(III)-Isomaltoside) will be administered through identical opaque bags. Placebo will be an isotonic saline solution. The randomization key will be stored online behind an encryption key (in EasyTrial), which only will be opened after all testing of primary outcomes have been concluded. In order to secure double blinding a specific procedure for administration will be performed outlined in figure 3. When randomization are performed the randomization ID will have a corresponding closed cardboard box with a label with the randomization ID. The box will contain everything needed for concealment, equipment for intravenous administration, isotonic saline solution, and if active also 1000 mg (maximum dosage) MonoFer (Iron(III)-Isomaltoside). The box will be delivered to a clinical nurse which will mix the drug and put it into the opaque bag. A project nurse will secure an intravenous catheter, tape the catheter with opaque tape, put the patients hand through a curtain and leave the room. The clinical nurse will then administer the drug/placebo behind the curtain. The project nurse will do the observation of the patient during the infusion and the clinical nurse will remove the drug/placebo after end infusion. The box will be packed by the Central Pharmacy of Region Zealand and delivered to each site. All clinical nurses will receive training prior to initiation of the study in regards to proper mixing and concealment procedure.\n\nTrial medication, packaging, labeling and administration The trial medication in use for this trial is weight depended MonoFer (Iron(III)isomaltoside 100 mg/ml) versus placebo which is isotonic saline, as an one-time dosage administered intravenously in hospital. The weight depended dosages are as follows: \\<50 kg bodyweight: 500 mg, 50-59 kg bodyweight: 600 mg, 60-69 kg bodyweight: 700 mg, 70-79 kg bodyweight: 800 mg, 80-89 kg bodyweight: 900 mg, and \u226590 kg bodyweight 1000 mg Monofer. MonoFer needs to be mixed with isotonic saline just prior to administration. Thus, in order to secure proper concealment everything needing for mixing and administration are packed in closed cardboard boxes. The boxes are labelled in concordance with The Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union Directive 2003/94/EC\n\nEach cardboard box will contain 500 ml isotonic saline infusion fluid, a drop line and an opaque bag which will cover both the line and the fluid, labeling for the opaque bag, and a standard operating procedure document detailing handling and allocation concealment procedure (appendix II: H\u00e5ndtering af fors\u00f8gsmedicin). If allocated to the active group the box will also contain 10ml MonoFer 100mg/ml.\n\nIf the administration are interrupted before the full dosage are administered the actual dosage given are noted by the clinical nurse and passed on to the project nurse which will secure the registration without deblinding the patient or research staff. Otherwise the full dosage of 500 ml will be recorded.\n\nThe infusion will be stopped if the patient experiences any adverse effects during the infusion. A particular reaction called a 'Fishbane reaction' in which the patient develops reddening of the skin, especially in the face, and truncal myalgia, but without any other symptoms of an allergic reaction will not be cause termination of the infusion. The Fishbane reaction is always selflimitating and is not associated with respiratory stridor, edema, hypotension or tachycardia. In case of a Fishbane reaction the infusion is stopped until the symptoms have dissipated, then the infusion is restarted, but with double the infusion time. If the Fishbane reaction reoccurs the infusion is terminated and dosage given registered.\n\nDefinition of per protocol Patients are considered per protocol if the patient received full dosage of placebo or MonoFer, and underwent surgery for a malignant tumor.",

    "brief_summary": "Lactobacillus GG (LGG) is able to exert long lasting effects in children with atopic disorders. Nutramigen LGG accelerates tolerance acquisition in infants with cow's milk allergy. The mechanisms of these effects are still largely undefined. The effect of LGG could be related at least in part by the immunoregulatory role played by LGG. This probiotic can balance the generation of cytokines possibly involved in IgE- or non-IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy Interleulkin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3 , TGF-\u03b2, and TNF-\u03a5), which can contribute to modulation of inflammatory processes. The investigators have demonstrated that children with IgE-mediated CMA produce significantly higher level of IL-4 and IL-13 in response to cow's milk protein, and that tolerance is associated with a marked reduction of IL-13 production and a concomitant increased frequency of IFN-\u03b3 releasing cells. Epigenetics studies the heritable (and potentially reversible) changes of the genome inherited from one cell generation to the next which alter gene expression but do not involve changes in primary DNA sequences, highlighting the complexity of the inter-relationship between genetics and nutrition. There are three distinct, but closely interacting, epigenetic mechanisms (histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and non-coding microRNAs) that are responsible for modifying the expression of critical genes associated with physiologic and pathologic processes. The profile of epigenetic modifications associated with Th lineage commitment, coupled with the sensitivity of the early developmental period, has led to speculation that factors that disrupt these pathways may increase the risk of allergic diseases. Specifically, effects on DNA methylation and endogenous histone deacetylase inhibitors acting on specific pathways (Th1 and T regulatory cell differentiation) may favour Th2-associated allergic differentiation. MicroRNAs are another structural components of an epigenetic mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of messenger RNA translation. It has been recently identified a specific Th2-associated microRNA (miR-21) that is critical for the regulation of Th cell polarization. It has been previously demonstrated an inverse DNA methylation pattern of cytokines involved in Th2 response (IL-4, IL-5) compared with cytokines involved in Th1 response (IL-10, INF- y) in children with CMA acquiring oral tolerance, with the most pronounced effects in those treated with Nutramigen LGG.",

    "detailed_description": "Compared to adult cancers, most pediatric cancers carry a relatively low mutational burden. HDAC inhibition (HDACi) modifies T-cell regulation and can augment response to checkpoint inhibition by reducing the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and creating an immunogenic tumor microenvironment including induction of MHCI and neo-antigens. In vitro and in vivo models showed enhanced anti-tumor activity of the combination of checkpoint inhibition and HDACi compared to either agent alone. This provides a strong rationale to combine these drug classes. Checkpoint inhibition results in activation of tumor-associated T cells. It is now becoming increasingly evident that patients with tumors with a high number of tumor infiltrating T cells at baseline show an increased response rate. Additionally, recent clinical data on immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) for melanoma patients detected tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) as indicators of an activated adaptive immune response. Their presence has been linked to objective treatment responses in patients with different cancer entities receiving ICI.\n\nFurthermore, MYC- or NMYC-driven (referred to as MYC(N)) malignancies like very high-risk medulloblastomas or very high-risk neuroblastomas still have a dismal outcome. MYC is not only reported to upregulate PD-L1 and thereby a possible biomarker for checkpoint inhibition but also very compelling recent preclinical data strongly suggests that HDAC inhibitors are active against MYC amplified medulloblastoma in vitro and in vivo. In NMYC amplified neuroblastoma cell lines similar observations were made in vitro. In addition, it has been shown recently that the molecular MYC subgroup of atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRT) exhibit a strong T-cell infiltrate in contrast to the SHH-ATRT subtype and are considered immunological \"hot\" tumors. Taken together, our results suggest that MYC(N)-driven tumors depend on HDAC and we hypothesize that MYC(N) status can serve as a biomarker for response prediction to a combinatorial treatment of checkpoint inhibition and HDAC inhibition.\n\nPediatric patients aged 2-21 years with refractory/relapsed/progressive high-risk malignancies with a high mutational load (group A), with MYC(N) amplification or from the ATRT-MYC subgroup (group C) as well as patients with high TILs and/or TLS positive (group E) are eligible for this trial. Phase I determines the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination of the HDACi entinostat and the checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab for the age groups 6-11 and 12-21 years, respectively. Phase II investigates activity in 3 groups A, C, E for patients in the two age cohorts 2-11 and 12-21 years. The duration of treatment is 12 cycles (1 cycle = 28 days), preceded by 1 priming week.\n\nIn addition, a comprehensive accompanying research program investigates PD biomarkers for immune checkpoint and HDAC inhibition.\n\nClinical trials investigating the combination of nivolumab and entinostat in children have not been reported so far.",

    "brief_summary": "Viruses are a major health problem for the general public and at risk populations. Normally, detection of antibody titers is the gold standard for determining the effectiveness of the immune system following natural or vaccine caused immunization. However, determining the effectiveness of other parts of the immune system are less common due to the difficulties with testing. Furthermore, there is a critical need to address other therapies in case vaccination is not successful in immuncompromised populations. Exercise has been shown to increase the strength of the immune system against many types of viruses and therefore could be simple way to improve immunity against the COVID-19 virus. The aim of this research is to determine the effects of exercise on anti-viral immunity against many types of common viruses before and after vaccination. We hypothesize that exercise will enhance the anti-viral immunity before and after vaccination.\n\nUp to 30 healthy volunteers (age 18-44 years) will be recruited to participate in this study. For completion of Aim 1, three visits are needed totaling around 7 hours of the patient's time and for Aim 2, three visits are needed totaling around 4.5 hours of the patient's time. The initial visit will be for pre-screening and if deemed healthy enough to participate, an exercise test to determine the VO2 max of the participant will be conducted. The following visits will require a trained phlebotomist to insert an in-dwelling catheter and participants will undergo a 20-minute incremental exercise trial. Approximately 50mL of blood will be collected at four different timepoints: at rest, 60% VO2 max, 80% VO2 max, and 1-hr post-exercise. All four collected blood samples will be used to expand viral specific T-cells and compare IFN-\u03b3 rele",
    "detailed_description": "Acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections (RTI) due to respiratory viruses, such as, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, parainfluenza virus (PIV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) are a major public health problem. During the 2019-2020 influenza season, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) determined that influenza accounted for 38 million illnesses, 18 million medical visits, 405,000 hospitalizations, and 22,00 deaths, and annual costs of approximately 87.1 billion in disease management in the United States. Simultaneously, the COVID 19 pandemic is currently a major health crisis across of the United States and worldwide with the number of cases surpassing 50 million and deaths totaling more than 1.3 million. Latent herpesviruses (cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV), and Varicella Zoster virus (VZV)) are other types of viral infections that are easily controlled in healthy people but in immunocompromised people, such as elderly or cancer patients, these latent viruses can become deadly. People receiving allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) are at high risk of CMV infection and can lead to significant morbidity in transplant patients. Due to these populations. An acute bout of exercise, as well as, chronic exercise training, have been shown to enhance anti-viral immunity against many of these respiratory viruses and latent herpesviruses. However, the immune response to viral infections is usually limited to the detection of humoral responses and the ability to produce antibodies titers is the gold standard for determining the effectiveness of the immune system in response to vaccination. However, monitoring the cellular immune response following natural or vaccine induced immunization less standardized. Numerous laboratory techniques have been developed to test the cellular immune response including, phenotyping antigen specific T-cells, intracellular staining of cytokines, ELISPOT or ELISA for antigen derived cytokine production, and antigen specific cytotoxicity assays. However, theses assays are laborious and typically require highly specialized lab equipment and techniques. Interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) release assays have been developed to focus on cellular immunity and could complement or replace these other laborious procedures. Thus we propose that a single bout of exercise in humans will enhance the total antiviral immunity to numerous respiratory viruses and latent herpesviruses, using a whole blood IFN-\u03b3 assay.\n\nSecondly, there is a critical need to develop new therapeutics that can be used both prophylactically and in the treatment of SARS CoV-2 infections. Adoptive cell therapy with viral specific T-cells (VST) has been used effectively to treat viral infections in immunocompromised patients, particularly in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This procedure has been used for \\>25 years with evidence of safety and efficacy. No group to our knowledge has attempted to manufacture SARS CoV-2 VSTs as a potential therapeutic to prevent and/or treat refractory SARS Co-V-2 infections during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Having a personalized or 'third-party' T-cell product that is 'banked' and readily available could offer a life-saving intervention for many 'at-risk' individuals (e.g. the elderly, cancer patients, diabetics, transplant recipients) should they develop COVID-19. Current COVID-19 vaccination strategies are focused on inducing neutralizing antibodies. This strain-specific approach is limited because immunity against drifted strains that emerge from one season to the next, or even during a single season, is often lost. Given that T-cells offer protection against multiple viral strains, there is strong rationale to develop a vaccine that targets T-cells capable of providing coronavirus heterotypic immunity. Dendritic Cell (DC) vaccines pulsed with viral antigen peptides have been used successfully to elicit immune responses against influenza, hepatitis C and HIV and could, therefore, serve as a personalized vaccine solution to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the present study, we plan to demonstrate preclinical proof of concept for a DC based vaccine by attempting to immunize \"humanized\" mice in vivo. Our proposed NOD-scid-IL2R\u03b3null (NSG) mouse model has been used successfully to generate preclinical data for human DC and VST based vaccines.",

This is because current CAR-T treatment uses \u03b1\u03b2 T cells - a type of immune cell which are largely non-transferable between individual human beings due to the high risk of Graft-versus-Host Disease. However, autologous CAR-T comes with many limitations. A lengthy, manufacturing process follows after the patient donates their own blood, accompanied by a high risk of manufacturing failure, which can be attributed to the cell quality from cancer patients undergoing stressful anti-cancer therapy.\n\nCytoMed Therapeutics pioneers a new CAR-T treatment (CTM-N2D) which may confer some benefit over current CAR-T treatment. CTM-N2D uses a subtype of immune cell -- \u03b3\u03b4 T cell. Secondly, the CAR on CTM-N2D targets a surface antigen called NKG2DL which are commonly present in many cancer. These two features may confer a safer product profile, of better quality and may be efficacious in cancers where previous CAR-T treatments has not.\n\nThe phase I clinical trial of CTM-N2D will be conducted at the National University Hospital, Singapore. The objective of this clinical trial is to determine the optimal dose of CTM-N2D, and to investigate its safety and tolerability. The subjects of the clinical trial will also be investigated for their tumour response to CTM-N2D.\n\nCTM-N2D has undergone preclinical studies. Relevant data from other clinical trials are also used to infer the expected outcome, and strategies of management of this clinical trial. The institution's ethical review board must give its approval before the study may begin. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board monitors the safety aspect of this trial.",
    "detailed_description": "Study Drug\n\nThe study treatment uses allogeneic NKG2DL-targeting CAR-grafted \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (also known as CTM-N2D). The treatment a) targets multiple stressed-induced cancer antigens (via the built-in receptors on \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, e.g., \u03b3\u03b4 TCR, NKG2D, DNAM-1); and (b) targets eight known NKG2DLs e.g., MICA/B, ULBP1-6 (via the grafted NKG2DL-targeting CAR). In humans, NKG2DLs are identified as MICA/B and ULBP1-6. Many tumour cell lines and primary tumours of various tissue-origins express NKG2DLs, providing attractive targets for CTM-N2D therapy\n\nCTM-N2D refers to allogeneic \u03b3\u03b4 T cells that express CARs containing an extracellular domain of NKG2D as binding unit. CTM-N2D is manufactured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of allogeneic healthy donors through \u03b3\u03b4 T cell expansion and mRNA electroporation.\n\nCTM-N2D will be packaged in an infusion bag to contain up to 1x10\\^9 cells in 100ml of infusible solution (saline with 5% human serum albumin) and delivered to the clinical site on the day of planned infusion. The transportation temperature will be maintained at 2 - 8\u00b0C.\n\nStudy Design\n\nThis is a two-cohort phase I study. In cohort 1 (interpatient dose-escalation cohort), the subjects will be given four infusions of CTM-N2D at escalating doses: 1x10\\^7, 1x10\\^8, 3x10\\^8 or 1x10\\^9 per infusion at an interval of one infusion every 7 days. This is to discern an optimal dose. In cohort 2 (optimal dose cohort), the subjects will be given four infusions of CTM-N2D at the optimal dose, which are given at an interval of one infusion every 7 days. This is to further confirm safety and tolerability.\n\nIf no DLT is detected in the first 3 patients in cohort 1, recruitment for cohort 2 will commence, with 6 patients to be treated with four doses of CTM-N2D at 1x10\\^9/infusion.\n\nPatients in the interpatient dose-escalation cohort will be treated in sequence for the first four doses (i.e., only after all first four doses are administered for the first patient, will therapy for the second patient be allowed to commence). Such restriction is not extended to the maintenance doses. In the optimal dose cohort, 3 patients will be recruited, treated, and observed for DLT first, before another 3 patients are recruited. If 0/6 or 1/6 DLT is seen in the optimal dose cohort, the optimal dose will be established as RP2D.\n\nIf the patients do not demonstrate progressive disease after the first 4 doses of CTM-N2D and after the first imaging at 2 months from the start of study treatment (i.e., C1:1D1), maintenance doses of CTM-N2D will be manufactured and administered once every 2 months for a maximum of 5 doses. A computed tomography (CT) scan (or other forms of radiological assessment deemed appropriate by the investigator) will be performed every 2 months to evaluate stability (or response) of disease before manufacturing (a 20-day process) and administering each maintenance dose.\n\nTreatment with CTM-N2D beyond 5 maintenance doses will be contingent to discussion with Sponsor and PI. Treatments with maintenance doses of CTM-N2D will not be considered in determining DLT.\n\nStudy Procedures and Assessments\n\nOnce informed consent is obtained and subject eligibility is confirmed, CytoMed will schedule and plan the manufacturing of CTM-N2D for the given subject.\n\nThe treatment regimen begins with lymphodepletion using Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide to precondition the patient before the first treatment cycle with four weekly doses of CTM-N2D. Zoledronic acid will be given one day before each CTM-N2D infusion to maximize the potency of CTM-N2D.mTrial subjects will receive CTM-N2D by i.v infusion. To further enhance the survival of CTM-N2D, a dose of 1x10\\^6 IU/m2 IL-2 will be injected subcutaneously within 2 hours after each CTM-N2D infusion.\n\nClinical assessments will be performed at specified timepoints as written in the protocol. Any other relevant laboratory/imaging evaluations can be performed at any point in time, as deemed appropriate by the site investigator(s).\n\nTo assess patient well-being after CTM-N2D infusion as well as to monitor the pharmacokinetics and bioactivities of CTM-N2D, blood samples will be collected from trial subjects at various time points throughout the study period. Other blood investigations are to be performed at the clinical site as scheduled in the trial protocol and according to institutional guidelines. Additional laboratory investigations may be performed at the discretion of the investigator.\n\nAssessments of tumour at specified timepoints, and are to be reported by a dedicated, independent radiologist, in accordance with RECIST criteria version 1.1. Other imaging modalities may be considered at the discretion of the investigator.\n\nOff-study Follow-up and Assessments\n\nIn the event CTM-N2D therapy is discontinued due to PD or unacceptable AE, off-study follow-up and assessments will be performed up to 14 days from the date the subject is removed from the study.\n\nIf the trial subject is removed from the study due to unacceptable AE, the AE should be followed for at least 28 days from the last dose of study treatment until the AE is stabilized, or until the initiation of other anti-tumour therapy as off-study treatment, whichever comes first.\n\nPost-study Follow-up and Procedures\n\nTrial subjects will be followed for survival status, at the discretion of the investigator, from the end of the study until their death, or for a period of up to 48 months after the last patient was initiated for study treatment, whichever occurs first.\n\nDiscontinuation Visit and Procedures\n\nUpon voluntary withdrawal from the study, trial subject will still be given the option to continue scheduled evaluations, as well as, to complete an end of study evaluation. Appropriate medical care will continue to be meted out by the clinicians at the study site.\n\nSafety, Adverse Events and Toxicity Management\n\nSafety of the study treatment regimen will be assessed by monitoring and recording any toxicities or Aes appeared in trial subjects during the study period. The descriptions of Aes and their grading scales found in the NCI CTCAE v5.0 will be utilized for AE reporting.\n\nReporting of Events\n\nThe investigator is expected to collect, record, and report the \"Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others\" (\"UPIRTSO\") events in the study to the NHG Domain Specific Review Boards (DSRB). The criteria for UPIRTSO events and their timeline for reporting to NHG DSRB are defined in the protocol.\n\nReporting of SAEs to HSA\n\nThe investigator is expected to collect, record and report SAEs to the Health Science Authority (HSA) through CytoMed Therapeutics Pte Ltd. All SAEs that are unexpected and related to the study drug will be reported to HSA.\n\nAll SAEs that are unexpected and related to the study drug will be reported. The investigator is responsible for informing CytoMed Therapeutics Pte Ltd within 24 hours after first knowledge that the case qualifies for expedited reporting. CytoMed Therapeutics Pte Ltd will report the SAEs to HSA no later than 15 calendar days upon receiving SAE reports from the investigator. Follow-information will be actively sought and submitted as it becomes available. For fatal or life-threatening cases, HSA will be notified as soon as possible but no later than 7 calendar days after first knowledge that a case qualifies, followed by a complete report within 8 additional calendar days.\n\nSafety Monitoring Plan\n\nThe investigator is responsible for appropriate medical care of subjects during the study. The investigator will review all patients to monitor toxicity before each treatment cycle. If a subject reports an AE, appropriate care and follow-up evaluation should be implemented by the investigator until the event is either resolved or stable.\n\nAn independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (iDSMB) formed by experts with relevant knowledge of the study will monitor the safety aspect of this trial. The board will review the safety data after completion of each cohort and/or if a DLT occurs.\n\nDose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs)\n\nDLT is defined as an unexpected grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity that is probably related to CTM-N2D infusion and experienced within 8 weeks immediately after the start of study treatment (i.e., C1:1D1). Treatments with maintenance doses of CTM-N2D will not be considered in determining DLT. The criteria for DLT is defined in the protocol.\n\nWhenever a patient experiences toxicity that fulfil the criteria for a DLT, the study treatment will be interrupted. The investigator is responsible for reporting DLT observed by the investigator to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.\n\nToxicity Management\n\nCurrent CAR-T cell therapy has been used to treat B-cell malignancies and multiple myeloma. The clinical experiences from these trials show that potential severe toxicities are not uncommon. Such potential severe toxicities in CAR-T therapy include cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), on-target off-tumour toxicity, tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) and immunogenicity.\n\nThe grading and management of potential CAR-T toxicities follow a grading system proposed by the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT; formerly American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, ASBMT). However, institution practices and sub-specialty input will prevail and supersede this protocol if necessary.\n\nA specific concern for CTM-N2D treatment is the potential \"on-target off-cancer\" toxicity. CTM-N2D targets NKG2D ligands, which may be upregulated in non-cancer cells upon infection, inflammation, or stress. The recognition of the non-cancer cells by CTM-N2D may cause CRS and autoimmune toxicity. Subjects will also monitored for Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS).\n\nSubject Withdrawal\n\nSubjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason, without prejudice to their future medical care by the investigator or at the institution. Subjects who do not complete the study protocol will be considered to have prematurely discontinued study. The reasons for premature discontinuation (for example, voluntary withdrawal, toxicity, death) must be recorded on the case report form. Final study evaluations will be completed at the time of discontinuation.\n\nThe investigator and/or sponsor can also decide to withdraw a subject from the investigational product and/or other protocol-required therapies, protocol procedures, or the study as a whole or at any time prior to study completion.\n\nStudy Monitoring\n\nThe principal investigator is responsible for familiarising the investigator(s) and the entire study team involved in the study with all study procedures, including the administration of the study drug. The investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of subjects who have enrolled for this study and for alerting the principal investigator to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unanticipated benefit to the subject. The investigators are responsible for appropriate medical care of subjects throughout the study period.\n\nIn the event of SAEs, or Aes that result in any subject(s) withdrawing from the study, the investigators remain responsible for the care and followup of the subject(s), until the AE resolves, stabilizes or is explained.\n\nData collection and analysis\n\nData are recorded and stored on an electronic data capturing system called Redcap. CRFs will be translated to SPSS and Excel spreadsheets for further analysis. ANOVA multivariate analysis will be used to determine statistical significance of continuous variables. Chi-square and Fisher's exact test will be used to assess associations between categorical variables.",

A hallmark of this defect is distorted expression of isoforms of the myosin heavy chain (MHC) protein, and this defect is linked to obesity-associated adverse health outcomes. By employing exercise and increase in plasma amino acids as investigational tools the investigators intend to modulate the metabolism of muscle MHC isoforms in order to unravel the biological mechanisms that sustain distorted MHC protein metabolism in muscle of humans with obesity.",
    "detailed_description": "Distorted expression of isoforms of the skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain (MHC) protein is a hallmark of altered protein metabolism in muscle of humans with obesity. The most striking feature of this, is a characteristic reduction in the content of the slow MHC-I isoform, which is responsible for determining the content of Type I muscle fibers. These fibers are characterized by increased capacity for glucose uptake, and in contrast to Type II fibers, maintain sensitivity to fuel metabolism within the adverse metabolic environment of obesity. Increased content of Type I fibers in skeletal muscle, and thus favorable metabolic effects in muscle, require increased expression of MHC-I in muscle. Importantly, the slow MHC-I gene drives the molecular mechanisms that determine the overall MHC protein metabolism and fiber type phenotype in skeletal muscle. The project seeks to determine the underlying biology that sustains distorted MHC protein metabolism in skeletal muscle of humans with obesity.\n\nThe investigators evaluate protein metabolism in skeletal muscle of humans with obesity and lean controls, and focus specifically on that of MHC isoforms. The investigators determine gene expression of the MHC isoforms and associated molecular factors implicated in activating Type I muscle fiber programming. Acute aerobic exercise and increase in plasma amino acids are employed as experimental tools to target biological processes of transcription and translation related to MHC genes expression in skeletal muscle. The overall findings will provide an understanding of mechanisms responsible for unfavorable MHC proteome and fiber type phenotype in skeletal muscle of humans with obesity.",

    "detailed_description": "\u2022 During the phase I stage, patients will start receiving pembrolizumab at a fixed dose of 200 mg as a 30-min intravenous (IV) infusion followed by PM01183 at a starting dose of 2.4 mg/m2 as a 1-h IV infusion on Day 1, both every 3 weeks (Q3W). A cycle is defined as an interval of 3 weeks.\n\nPM01183 dose will be escalated from the starting dose in successive cohorts of patients, with a pre-established fixed dose increase (in mg/m2) of approximately 30%.\n\nDose escalation will follow a classical 3+3 design, according to the observed tolerance and safety. All evaluable patients within a dose level will be followed for at least one cycle (i.e., 3 weeks) before dose escalation may proceed. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be the lowest dose level explored during dose escalation at which one third or more of evaluable patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in Cycle 1.\n\nDose escalation will be terminated once the MTD or the last dose level (i.e., DL2) is reached, whichever occurs first, except if all DLTs occurring at a given dose level are related to neutropenia. If this is the case, dose escalation may be resumed, starting at the lowest dose level at which exclusively neutropenia-related DLTs were observed, and will follow the same original schedule but with mandatory primary granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis.\n\nAn expansion cohort to complete a minimum of 6 evaluable patients will be recruited at the immediate lower dose level from the MTD, or at DL2 if the MTD is not defined yet.

If no disease progression as per immune RECIST (iRECIST) 1.1 is observed in this assessment, treatment will continue until disease progression as per iRECIST 1.1.\n\nIf at the end of the study (i.e., clinical cut-off, as defined in Section 2.1.1) any patients are still on treatment with lurbinectedin monotherapy, the investigator will evaluate if it is appropriate that they continue receiving that treatment. If needed, the Sponsor may facilitate appropriate measures to ensure access to lurbinectedin and maintenance of safety reporting obligations beyond study closure in those cases. According to the end of study definition (see Section 2.1.1), no patients will remain under treatment with pembrolizumab at the clinical cut-off.\n\nSafety will be evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v.5, whereas antitumor response will be assessed using the RECIST 1.1, and also the iRECIST 1.1 whenever applicable. These methods are generally accepted as standard clinical procedures in oncological studies.",

Furthermore, the trial will explore whether patients in performance status ECOG 2 may benefit from sotorasib. In this study, a relevant number of sotorasib-na\u00efve patients (n=100) will be treated with sotorasib and followed for efficacy and side effects. MRI-scans both at base-line and regularly during therapy will give data on intracranial efficacy. Eligible patients will be previously treated with at least 1 line standard (chemo)immunotherapy, or deemed in-eligible for standard (chemo)immunotherapy.\n\nIn part II of the study, comprehensive analyses of biological samples taken pretreatment, and post-progression will provide novel information about resistance mechanisms on sotorasib. Furthermore, analyses of biopsies taken at partial response (estimated to be performed in 25-30% of cases) may potentially also characterize non-eradicated residual cells after achieved response. The post-progression biopsies may indicate the optimal next-line therapy.",

    "brief_summary": "Hidradenitis Suppurativa is a recurrent chronic inflammatory follicular occlusive disease affecting hair follicles. HS is notoriously difficult and challenging to treat with a high morbidity impact and could be classified as an unmet medical need with no efficient therapeutic options.\n\nObjective:\n\nInvestigators previously showed that Outer Root Sheath Cells (ORS) isolated from hair follicle of HS patients (HS-ORS) have a pro-inflammatory phenotype and secrete spontaneously IP-10 and RANTES. To identify the mechanisms involved in the pro-inflammatory phenotype of HS-ORS, investigators performed a transcriptomic analysis in healthy and HS patients. This revealed: (i) an IFN signature, (i) a dysregulation of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, and (iii) an upregulation of DNA damage response and cell cycle G2/M checkpoint pathways in HS-ORS. These findings support the notion that, in HS patients, a perturbation of HF-SC homeostasis leading to an increased proliferation induces a replicative stress and an accumulation of cytoplasmic ssDNA, stimulating IFN synthesis through IFI16-STING pathway. Interestingly, replicative stress in ORS were present in some but not all patients with Hidradenitis Suppurativa. The goal of study is to determine replicative stress in ORS in a large cohort of HS patients.\n\nMethod Patients will be enrolled in the Mondor Dermatology department, during routine care. A dermatologist will check all inclusion and exclusion criteria with the technical support of a research technician of the Henri Mondor Clinical Investigation Center. Medical history, clinical data, comorbidities and concomitant therapies will be prospectively recorded in a dedicated case report form. Skin biopsies will be performed in perilesional zone rich in hair follicles. mRNA will be extracted from freshly isolated hair follicle cells and some slides will be prepared and stored at -80\u00b0C to perform immunohistochemistry analysis on freshly isolated hair follicle cells. PBMC and serum will be collected.\n\nAll these biological samples will allow us to quantify the replicative stress in HS-ORS of each patient, and to quantify several cytokine of interest : IFN de type 1, IL-17, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10\n\nThis study will allow investigators to evaluate the rate of patients with replicative stress in hair follicle stem cells in Hidradenitis Suppurativa. The investigator will also determine whether HF-SC replication stress correlates with clinical characteristics and/or with clinical course and/or comorbidities.",

NMIBC-tumors are graded into high grade (HG) and low grade (LG) according to the histological characteristics of their TUR-B specimen. Generally, intravesical Mitomycin C is recommended to treat LG tumors and intravesical BCG is recommended for treating HG tumors.3,4.\n\nFollow-up schedules based on risk of recurrence. The histological grade, number of tumors, tumor size, T-stage, recurrence-rate and presence of carcinoma in situ (CIS) is used to estimate risk of recurrence according to the EORTC-scoring system.

High risk tumors are followed-up with flexible cystoscopy and urinary cytology every four months until two recurrence-free years, whereas low and intermediate risk tumors are followed utilizing the 4-8-12 model where intervals between follow up are increased for patients without recurrence until 5 disease-free years.3 The evidence behind these follow-up schedules is not based on high level evidence and research but rather on tradition and 'clinical experience'.\n\nClinical challenge of current follow-up schedules The majority of patients with HG tumors will have recurrence despite treatment, especially within the two first years after diagnosis. Moreover, many patients will receive lifelong follow-up cystoscopy and urinary cytology tests. Follow-up schedules are costly due to many visits at the hospital for flexible cystoscopy, urinary cytology, and treatment. A micro-costing analysis performed by the Urological Research Unit at Aarhus University Hospital prior to initiation of the current study, has shown that the total expense in relation to flexible cystoscopy in the outpatient clinic is approximately 315 EUR per examination (Appendix 1). Equally important to frequency and cost of follow-up, every follow-up visit is associated with patient discomfort, pain, risk of infections, and strictures of the urethra.6 Each cystoscopy carries a 15% risk of complications. Nearly 1,500 cystoscopies are carried out in HG patients in Central Denmark Region each year, resulting in approximately 240 complications each year, with cystitis being the most common complication. Furthermore, flexible cystoscopy is not always reliable in terms of diagnosing recurrences and CIS.7-9\n\nUrinary biomarkers A proposed alternative to flexible cystoscopy in the detection of recurrent NMBIC is non-invasive molecular urinary markers that detect mRNA, protein or DNA from selected genes relevant for bladder cancer in urine samples. Several studies have been prospectively validated and shown high sensitivity and specificity for urinary markers.10,11 Recently, the Xpert Bladder Cancer Monitor test was shown by Valenberg et al.12 to have a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 76% for HG disease and similarly D'Elia et al.13 showed a specificity of 77% and sensitivity of 46% for a cohort of mainly LG patients. However, studies have until now focused mainly on detection of NMIBC in patients with incident tumors, which are most often larger and more easily diagnosed with urinary biomarkers than recurrences.14 To our knowledge, no studies have so far substituted cystoscopies for urinary biomarkers in a randomized controlled setting. Thus, the need for high level evidence regarding the use of urinary biomarkers for surveillance of NMIBC is still there.",

    "detailed_description": "Lifestyle therapy is important for treating lifestyle-related morbidities such as obesity. Such therapy often includes exercise and nutrition, and leads to improved health, functionality and quality of life. Unfortunately, obesity leads to adverse changes in the physiological milieu, including inflammation and altered nutritional status such as reduced omega-3:omega-6 ratios. Indeed, inadequate omega 3 levels are common even among lean individuals. This may negatively affect the outcome of lifestyle therapy with exercise, particularly those involving resistance training, contributing to the large heterogeneity seen in training responses. In accordance with this, many individuals (including both lean and obese subjects) fail to improve muscle biology/functions and health, including failure to increase muscle mass and strength, failure to improve glucose handling and inflammatory status. This makes general lifestyle therapy recommendations ineffective. Here, we investigate effects of double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled n3-fatty acid supplementation (1000 mg day-1) and 13 weeks of low- and high-load resistance training on muscle growth/function/biology and health in individuals with obesity (BMI\\>30, n=60) and lean controls (BMI\\<30, n=60). Each participant will perform two different training protocols, one on each leg. The supplement period will commence 7 weeks prior to the onset of the strength training intervention to ensure adequate omega-3 biology at the onset of training. Analyses include assessment of the separate and combined effects of n3-supplementation and obesity on training responses to resistance training, measured as muscle mass, muscle strength/functionality, muscle biological traits, and systemic health variables such as hormone/inflammation/glucose biology, adipose tissue biology/mass, gut microbiome and health-related quality of life. The project will provide important insight into the feasibility of resistance training and n-3 fatty acid supplementation for treating individuals with obesity, paving the way for personalized lifestyle therapy.\n\nThe study has two defined main outcome measures, targeting the combined effects of omega-3 and strength training on i) muscle thickness of the thigh (measured using ultrasound; this main outcome measure targets the effects of the intervention on muscle growth), and ii) glucose tolerance (measured using an oral glucose test; this main outcome measure targets the effects of the intervention on improvements in health).\n\nIn our analytical approach, we will use a mixed model-approach to assess the main effects of the intervention, mainly defined as changes from before to after the resistance training intervention. Importantly, for health variables such as glucose tolerance, analyses will be performed by accounting for individual variation at baseline, as any beneficial effect can be expected to be higher/present only in individuals with a pathological/diseased starting point. Notably, for many variables, we will collect data from two additional time points (pre-supplementation and after two weeks of familiarization to training). These data will provide insight into additional perspectives, such as the effects of omega-3 intake-only on glucose tolerance, which will bring additional depth to our conclusions (these analyses are not necessarily specified in the Outcome Measures section). For other data, such as primary cultivation of skeletal muscle and muscle mitochondrial respiration, data will only be collected from a randomized subset of participants. For analyses of the effects of the intervention on obesity-related pathophysiologies and health-related quality of life, data from a group of non-intervention individuals will act as reference values (data sampled alongside the intervention). Finally, we will use regression analyses to explain individual differences in training responses, with particular emphasis on muscle hypertrophy/glucose tolerance and their mechanistic origin of nature.\n\n2021/08: The number of anticipated participants was increased from 120 to 150 due to circumstances relating to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic",

The main objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of personalized neoantigen tumor vaccine in subjects with advanced solid tumors, and secondary objective is to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of personalized neoantigen tumor vaccine in subjects with advanced solid tumors. According to the characteristics of safety and efficacy data in the dose escalation phase, the dose expansion is performed at the intended clinical dose based on the investigator's judgment, and the treatment will be performed in combination with PD-1 to further evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of personalized neoantigen tumor vaccine at a specific dose.\n\nBoth the dose escalation phase and dose expansion phase include a screening period (Week -4 \\~ Week -2), a baseline period (Week -1 \\~ Day -1), a treatment period (Day 1 \\~ Week 8 or 16), and a follow-up period. Subjects who signed and provided the formal informed consent entered the screening period. The treatment period included the initial treatment period (Day 1 \\~ Week 8) and the enhanced treatment period (Week 12 \\~ Week 16). The investigator determine if the subject is suitable to enter the enhanced treatment period based on the comprehensive judgment of the subject's efficacy, safety, compliance and other factors.\n\nDose escalation phase is the traditional 3 + 3 design,, 12-18 subjects are expected to be enrolled at 100 \u03bcg, 200 \u03bcg and 400 \u03bcg (3-6 subjects in each group). The low dose group will be enrolled first.\n\nThe investigator will choose the optimal clinical dose for dose expansion, which can be one dose group or multiple dose groups. PD-1 will be administered in parallel to further confirm the efficacy and safety of neoantigen tumor vaccine. About 18 subjects will be enrolled. The usage and dosage of PD-1 should aligned with the package insert.",

There is evidence to suggest that these microbes can affect gut health and immune response, including to vaccines. The investigators will examine how inulin in the diet (compared to the maltodextrin control) (1) causes changes in the composition and function of the gut microbes, (2) reduces gut inflammation and gut leakiness caused by the vaccine, (3) increases immune response to vaccination, and (4) changes the expression of important adhesion molecules on the surface of white blood cells.

In the current study, participants will consume 12 grams/day inulin or maltodextrin (control) for 3 weeks before the administration of the Ty21a typhoid fever vaccine, 1 week during the vaccine, and 1 week after the vaccine. Vaccine response will be measured by counting T cells and immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin A (IgA)-secreting plasma cells specific for Ty21a. Gut permeability will be measured at baseline, and before and after the vaccine administration.

Preclinical and small cohort studies suggest biomarkers from the primary tumor, stool and body fluids as markers of response. This prospective study will evaluate gastrointestinal microbiome (bacterial spices and virome) composition and exosomal mRNA expression of PD-L1 and IFN\u03b3 correlation with radiological response rates to ICIs treatment of advanced melanoma patients. Methods: Patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors as a first line treatment for metastatic melanoma are recruted to the study. Stool samples are submitted before the start of treatment, at the 12 (+/-2) week and 28 (+/-4) week, and at the event ( such as, suspected disease progression/hyperprogressio, immune related adverse event (irAE), etc). Peripheral venous blood samples are taken additionaly at the same time points for cytologic and molecular tests. Histological material from the tumor tissue is obtained before the start of immunotherapy treatment. Primary objectives are to determine whether human gastrointestinal microbiome (bacterial and viral) and exosomal mRNA expression of PD-L1 and IFN\u03b3 predict response to treatment with PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors and are associated with occurrence of irAE in patients with metastatic melanoma at different time points. Response is evaluated radiologically with imaging methods in accordance with the irRECIST criteria. Conclussion: Despite the great success of the treatment of metastatic melanoma with immunotherapy, there remains a significant proportion of patients who do not respond to treatment or who develop severe adverse events during treatment. Identification of novel predictive and prognostic biomarkers for immunotherapy treatment response is therefore necessary. This study is the first to combine and investigate multiple potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers and its dynamics. The results could serve for a better and multi-level understanding of the various factors influencing immunotherapy treatment.",

In 297 patients from this cohort (ancillary study), investigators assessed epicardial fat volume (EFV) using an artificial intelligence algorithm. In 42 of these patients, designated as early T2DM/DGE, an accumulation of epicardial fat and diabetes occurring before the age of 40 were observed, clinically approaching the clinical presentation of genetic lipodystrophy, although subcutaneous adipose tissue persisted in their case.\n\nThis study will focus on a case-control study nested within the pre-existing cohort of T2D patients (Angiosafe T2D), and more specifically within this cohort on a subgroup of 42 patients with early-onset diabetes and an abnormal distribution of adipose tissue caracterized by ectopic fat accumulation. In order to understand the severe metabolic phenotype observed in this group of 42 patients, investigators propose to perform a multiomic analysis combining clinico-biological, exomic, transcriptomic and lipidomic data.\n\nThis study will compare the rate of patients with at least one rare (\\&lt;1% general population) potentially pathogenic genetic variant in a coding region of the genetic lipodystrophy genes by whole exome sequencing in 42 early-onset T2DM and a high epicardial fat volume patients versus 42 patients without early-onset T2DM and/or high epicardial fat volume (control group).",

Participants will have their liver fat, body composition, and various markers of metabolic health assessed and then will be randomized to either the very-low calorie diet intervention or a free-living control group for two weeks. Upon completion of the two-week intervention period, participants will redo all of the pre-intervention assessments.

    "detailed_description": "Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hepatokine that confers multiple beneficial effects when signaling to other tissues in the body. This is particularly true in adipose tissue, where it improves insulin sensitivity and leads to adiponectin production/secretion. In healthy individuals, FGF21 secretion is induced by exercise: however, this effect is absent in people living with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Aberrant secretion of FGF21 and other hepatokines is associated with increases in ectopic fat in the liver, but it is unknown if depletion of ectopic liver fat ameliorate this effect.\n\n42 participants living with T2D will be recruited for this parallel randomized controlled trial. At baseline, participants will have their liver fat assessed via magnetic resonance imaging, exercise-induced FGF21 incremental area under the curve (following \\~1 hour of exercise on a cycle ergometer at a workload equivalent to 60% VO2peak) as well as anthropometrics and outcomes relating to cardiometabolic health. Participants will then be randomized to either 1) two weeks of a very-low calorie diet (VLCD; \\~800 kcal/day) or 2) two weeks of free living control (CON). Following the two week intervention period, participants will repeat the baseline outcome assessment.\n\nThe primary objective of this trial is to determine whether diet-induced liver fat depletion will restore exercise-induced FGF21 secretion in people living with T2D. Secondary objectives include determining the effect of diet-induced liver fat depletion on fasting levels of circulating FGF21 and expression of FGF21 receptor/co-receptors and downstream signals in adipose tissue, as well as other cardiometabolic outcomes.",

Both vectors have been engineered to express the spike, nucleocapsid and RNA polymerase proteins.\n\nUp to 36 healthy volunteers will be enrolled in this dose escalation study. The first cohort (n=6) will receive Ad5-triCoV/Mac (n=3) or ChAd-triCoV/Mac (n=3) at the lowest dose of 10e5 TCID50, administered using the AeroNeb Solo Vibrating Mesh Nebulizer. Assuming no safety concerns, participants will then be administered Ad5-triCoV/Mac (n=3) or ChAd-triCoV/Mac (n=3) at a dose of 10e6. Assuming no safety signals we will move to vaccinate at the next dose level of 1x10e7 TCID50. Decisions about dose escalation will be made independently for each vaccine based on safety and immunogenicity profile. If the immunogenicity endpoints are not reached, in the absence of a safety signal, at the 10e7 dose level, we will move to the next dose level of 3x10e7 TCID50 and enrol three participants/vaccine group. Similarly, if all of the immunogenicity endpoints in the BAL are not met at 3x10e7, and in the absence of any safety signal, we will further escalate to 6x10e7, then 1x10e8 TCID50 and enrol three participants/vaccine group, if required. Once safety has been shown in participants without a history of COVID, we will proceed to enrol participants with a history of COVID infection to receive ChAd-triCoV/Mac, beginning with a dose of 3x10e7 (n=3) and, in the absence of any safety signal, escalating to 6x10e7 and, if required, 1x10e8 and, once the optimal dose has been determined based on immunogenicity outcomes, continue to enrol participants at this dose level to complete enrolment of the cohort (n=6).\n\nAntibody and specific T cell responses will be measured in lung from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collected at bronchoscopy at baseline and at 4 weeks following vaccination and in blood at several time points up to week 48 following vaccination.\n\nSafety endpoints will include the nature of any adverse events, their severity and the probability of a relationship to study procedures and administration of vaccine.",

    "detailed_description": "Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is estimated to affect approximately 25-30% of the population in Western countries and is now the leading cause of chronic liver disease globally. NAFLD is a progressive liver disease and approximately 30% of individuals progress from simple steatosis to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), which can further progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the Netherlands, it is estimated that 2.5 million people have NAFLD and this number is thought to increase by 50% in the next 10 years driven by an increasing prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and an ageing population. Independent of other cardiometabolic diseases, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in individuals with NAFLD, followed by extrahepatic malignancies and liver-related complications. NAFLD results in sustained healthcare costs and economic losses, and reduced health-related quality of life.\n\nIt is now widely accepted that liver fibrosis is a result of liver injury secondary to NAFLD and is a major predictor for liver-related and overall mortality in individuals with NAFLD. The process of fibrosis progression is not completely understood, and it can vary considerably from one individual to another. Several risk factors for fibrosis progression have been identified: age, hypertension, obesity and type 2 diabetes. As of to date, no treatment is available that proved to be successful to target hepatic fibrosis. The only therapeutic options currently available therefore are the control of the concomitant metabolic diseases in addition to diet and lifestyle changes. Unfortunately, this inevitably will lead to polypharmacy and thereby decreases treatment adherence and increases the risk of adverse events and interactions with other drugs.\n\nRecently, cellular senescence has been put forward as a causal factor in the development and progression of NAFLD and NAFLD related liver fibrosis. Cellular senescence is one of the hallmarks of aging and is defined as a stable arrest of the cell cycle coupled to specific phenotypic changes. Senescent cells secrete a collection of proteins called the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). This pro-inflammatory secretome drives age-related tissue dysfunction. Interestingly, metabolic dysregulation is thought to favor cellular senescence in several tissues involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD such as the liver, pancreas and adipose tissue, further perpetuating metabolic dysregulation. Of interest, cellular senescence can be targeted using senolytics. The combination of dasatinib, which is an EMA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor and the antioxidant quercetin, which is a flavonol present in many fruits and vegetables, successfully clears senescent cells. Recent work in humans and rodents have shown that tissue function, including liver metabolism, can be recovered by clearing senescent cells with senolytics including.\n\nDue the potential role of senescence in NAFLD related fibrosis, dasatinib plus quercetin might thus be an interesting future therapeutic option to tackle NAFLD related fibrosis. Based on the long-term safety profile of these treatments and the high unmet clinical need as there currently is no treatment for NAFLD we aim to perform a double-blind randomized controlled proof-of-principle study in which patients with NAFLD related liver fibrosis will be treated with dasatinib plus quercetin intermittently three days per week for three weeks, followed by a four-week medication-free period. Subsequently, this treatment cycle will be repeated three times",

In a cohort of 109 hospitalized diuretic resistance (DR) HF patients that received 12.5mg bumetanide, a peak FENa \\<5% occurred in 66% patients. The mean FENa in this group was 2.6 \u00b1 1.3 %, thus FENa \\<5% is common and a clinically relevant threshold for DR, and thus was chosen as the threshold to define diuretic resistance for the proposed study.\n\nParticipants will be asked to follow the study diet as the design seeks to decrease the variability of diuretic response introduced by variations in dietary sodium intake. For the current study, a four-gram sodium (0.8 g/kg protein) diet will be utilized. Four grams was chosen since, in prior experience, this is the average pre-study sodium intake of outpatient HF study participants and thus will facilitate rapid transition into balance.",

    "detailed_description": "Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is one of the most common and persistent symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), with an estimation of 18-22% developing persistent (\\> 3 months) PTH. PTH is highly disabling. Unfortunately, its typical characteristics and pathophysiology are poorly understood leading to its complicated and diverse management.\n\nThere is no agreement on the clinical presentation of PTH.This is largely due to the scarcity of longitudinal prospective data on large cohorts of PTH. Describing headache phenotypes longitudinally might improve disease characterization, facilitate better classification and provide evidence based-criteria of diagnosing PTH. Furthermore, exploring biomarkers associated with mTBI may provide new knowledge on the poorly understood pathophysiology of post commotional symptoms (PCS) and PTH. Additionally, there are indications of somatosensory disturbances and impaired endogenous analgesic systems in PTH patients. Assessment of somatosensory signs and symptoms in relation to pain complaints and functioning of endogenous analgesic system may also aid in better understanding of pain mechanisms in these patients. Functioning of endogenous analgesic system can be assessed using conditioned pain modulation (CPM) paradigms. Further, a curious observation in concussion patients with face and/or head pain is that they perceive painful/affected area (head and/or face region) as \"swollen\" or \"different\" without any clinical signs or obvious physical differences. Hence, such \"illusions\" represent body image distortions or perceptual distortion (PD) of the head or face region, and may contribute to the chronification of pain. PD can significantly affect psychosocial well-being of patients as the face/head region is a key feature of one\u00b4s identity. Unfortunately, such a distressing phenomenon has not been investigated before in these patients. Currently, no strong evidence-based treatment guidelines for PTH exist. Neuromodulation using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting involved brain regions and functional networks has recently been employed to treat several chronic pain conditions including migraine. Thus, rTMS could offer an optimal new treatment strategy for PTH, as there is an evidence of brain network dysfunction in these patients.\n\nThe overall aim is to advance the knowledge on the characterization and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of persistent PTH. The aim is also to measure the prevalence of perceived size changes (PD) of head and/or face region in patients with mild traumatic brain injury and its association with pain/PTH and other post commotional symptoms (PCS). The investigators will also evaluate the efficacy of rTMS on PTH. Deep phenotyping of PTH will be performed. Blood samples from mTBI patients will be examined for the biomarkers of PCS and PTH and the association between the biomarkers and the symptom levels of PCS, in particular PTH frequency and intensity will be evaluated. Baseline biomarker levels in the blood samples from patients with mTBI will be compared to biomarker levels in blood samples from anonymous healthy age- and sex matched controls (blood donors) or published reference intervals from the litterature. Additionally, the association between somatosensory function including CPM and the PTH frequency and intensity will be examined. Further, the effect of rTMS on headache severity and frequency (primary outcome) and somatosensory function, PD and other PCS (secondary outcome) after 1 and 3 months of stimulation will be evaluated.",

The IB will be reviewed annually and amended when further information becomes available.\n\nOsteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease of the joints that affects millions of people worldwide, yet its exact causes are not fully understood. Middle-aged to elderly individuals are often the most impacted by OA, which primarily affects the knee, hip, spine, and joints in the fingers. Among these, knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is the most common form, causing pain, stiffness, and reduced functionality, and it is a major contributor to chronic bone and muscle pain. It is also a leading cause of disability in adults who are not living in institutions. Treatment for KOA is challenging due to its resistance to medications, procedures, and surgeries. The primary objective is to alleviate pain and enhance overall function. However, since there is currently no cure for OA, the need for an effective therapy remains urgent. Healthcare professionals often encounter patients whose pain may result from an inflammatory response triggered by injury or disease. Research suggests that regenerative medicine, utilizing techniques like stem cells, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), amniotic fluid, and cytokine modulation, holds promise for treating KOA.\n\nOA is associated with an increase in pro-inflammatory substances such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cytokine-inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). These inflammatory agents affect various cell types within the affected joints, including chondrocytes, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, synoviocytes, and macrophages. Some miRNAs, which are downregulated in OA, have been identified as protective factors. For example, miR-130 helps regulate TNF-\u03b1 levels, while miR-149 controls several inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. The breakdown of the cartilage matrix is a key characteristic of OA. MMP-13, a member of the MMP family, plays a significant role in degrading the collagen network during OA development. Several miRNAs, including miR-27b, miR-27a, miR-148a, miR-320, miR-127-5p, and miR-411, are downregulated in OA and target the mRNA of this proteinase. It is important to note that a single miRNA can regulate multiple target genes associated with OA progression. For instance, miR-105 and miR-148, both downregulated in OA, target genes such as Runx2, ADAMTS4, ADAMTS5, ADAMTS7, ADAMTS12, MMP-13, and COL10, implying their potential protective roles.\n\nSeveral studies have shown a link between certain miRNAs, aging, and the progression of OA. For example, miR-320c is downregulated in aging OA samples and regulates ADAMTS5, suggesting that this miRNA may serve as a protective factor by enhancing chondrogenesis.",
    "detailed_description": "The investigational product being assessed in this trial is called NANOVAE, which is a biologic derived from human amniotic fluid (HAF) that is allogenic and acellular. HAF contains a wide range of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular vesicles/nanoparticles obtained from perinatal tissue. These components contribute to the regenerative potential of HAF and make it a promising option for regenerative medicine applications, particularly in knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Studies have demonstrated that the extracellular vesicles found in HAF, including exosomes, have the ability to promote chondrogenesis and reduce inflammation, which are crucial processes in reversing the progression of KOA. Additionally, these vesicles have shown to stimulate cartilage regeneration, addressing the impaired cartilage repair typically observed in OA. Therefore, the administration of HAF-derived products has the potential to slow down the degenerative process and promote cartilage repair in patients with KOA. The growth factors and cytokines present in HAF may also help alleviate the inflammatory response observed in the knee joint, a characteristic feature of KOA. These anti-inflammatory properties, combined with the regenerative capabilities of the extracellular vesicles, make HAF an appealing candidate for the treatment of KOA.\n\nNumerous clinical studies registered under ClinicalTrials.gov have provided evidence of the safety and effectiveness of HAF products in joint therapies. The use of HAF for treating OA holds immense potential due to its array of growth factors, anti-inflammatory mediators, and medicinal signaling cells, which continue to undergo rapid advancements. In a non-FDA review study, a double-blinded controlled trial was conducted comparing the treatment of OA with freshly collected amniotic fluid and steroids. The results revealed a significant improvement in the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) after three months of treatment, with continuous improvement in VAS after six months in both groups. However, the group receiving freshly collected amniotic fluid exhibited greater improvement. These findings strongly support the potential of this novel HAF therapy for advanced OA, as it proved to be superior and longer lasting compared to conventional therapies commonly practiced. Further research, both in terms of basic science and clinical investigations, is warranted to gain a better understanding of the anti-inflammatory properties of amniotic fluid and determine the most efficacious amniotic fluid product for symptomatic OA.\n\nNANOVAE is a filtered form of HAF (human amniotic fluid) that utilizes the wide range of nanoparticles, cytokines, and growth factors present in the fluid, which play vital roles in fetal development and maturation. HAF is a rich source of collagen substrates, growth factors, amino acids, polyamines, lipids, carbohydrates, cytokines, and extracellular matrix molecules like hyaluronic acid and fibronectin, as well as cells. These components greatly contribute to tissue protection and repair. Extensive research has demonstrated the antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and growth-promoting properties of HAF. The antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal effects of HAF have been established through the identification of various components such as lysozyme, peroxidase, transferrin, \u03b2-lysin, immunoglobulins, and zinc-peptide complexes within the fluid. The immunomodulatory functions of HAF have been observed in its ability to suppress alloreactive responses and downregulate Th1 and Th2 cytokines.\n\nNANOVAE's extracellular vesicle (EV) fraction consists of several cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that are associated with functions such as host defense, anti-inflammatory response, angiogenesis, and cartilage repair. The concentration of nanoparticles in the final product has been consistently demonstrated through nanoparticle analysis using the ZetaView Quatt nanoparticle analyzer. This analysis reveals a range of particles, with an average mode particle size of 96.4 nM, which aligns with the expected size of exosomes ranging between 50-200 nm in diameter.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective: To demonstrate the safety of NANOVAE administered intraarticular in subjects with KOA by measuring the incidence of any of the following treatment-emergent adverse events (TE-AEs) and treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TE-SAEs) within the first 30 days of injection:\n\nOccurrence of adverse events related to the therapy within 30 days of NANOVAE treatment.\n\nLife-threatening event (e.g., stroke or non-fatal pulmonary embolism). Event resulting in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Event resulting in death.\n\nSecondary Objective: To demonstrate the potential efficacy of NANOVAE by measuring the following clinical response changes from baseline to 12 months after injection. Time Frame: Month 1, 3, 6, and 12 after infusions:\n\nChange in single leg stance test. Change in \"Timed Up and Go\" test to assess fall risk. Change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index (five items for pain, two for stiffness, and seventeen for function).\n\nChange in range of motion, assessed by goniometer measurements. Change in serum and/or synovial biomarkers between the timepoints of Day 0 and the 3-month visit.\n\nDesign and Investigational Plan: A total of 24 subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be divided into two groups. Group 1 will be an open-label lead-in phase. Group 2 will be a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled cohort. Group 1 will receive one dose of 2ml of NANOVAE, and Group 2, in a randomized and double-blinded fashion, will receive two doses of 2ml NANOVAE. Neither the patients nor the researchers will know who is getting the placebo and who is getting the NANOVAE; only the product manufacturing staff will be unblinded. The ratio of placebo to NANOVAE is 1:1 for a total of 16 subjects in Group 2. Only the knee with the more severe symptoms of OA will be treated. The allogenic-HAF will be obtained from healthy donors and manufactured by the Nova Vita Laboratories processing lab.\n\nGroup 1 (Open Label): A total of eight subjects will be treated to assess safety prior to enrolling Group 2. Safety will be assessed at seven-day intervals for the 8 subjects in Group 1, staggered by 5 days after receiving the dose of NANOVAE.\n\nDose: 2 mL of NANOVAE on Day 0 containing 1.0 x 10\u00b9\u00b9 to 9.0 x 10\u00b9\u00b9 particles/ml. Product will be administered directly without any dilution.\n\nAfter these 8 subjects complete the 5-day safety assessment, the safety report will be presented to the DSMB with representative data to determine the safety status of receiving one dose of NANOVAE. Once the treatment of Group 1 has been determined to be safe, the enrollment of Group 2 will begin.\n\nGroup 2 (Randomized, double-blinded placebo control): A total of sixteen subjects will be randomized to either receive two doses of NANOVAE via intraarticular injections or receive two doses of a placebo.\n\nDose: 2 mL of NANOVAE or placebo on Day 0 and Day 15, containing 1 x 10\u00b9\u00b9 particles/ml. The ratio is 1:1 for a total of 16 subjects in Group 2. Product will be administered directly without any dilution.\n\nSample Size \\&amp; Study Population: A total of 24 adult patients will be chosen from the population of adults between the ages of 21 to 75 diagnosed with KOA who meet inclusion criteria.\n\nRoute of Administration: Intra-articular Injections.\n\nStudy Duration and Study Follow-Up: 12 months total duration:\n\nDay 0 and 15 - Intraarticular Injection and observational follow-up. Days 1 and 7 (after dose of NANOVAE or placebo) - Observational follow-up via phone call, telehealth, or in-person visit.\n\nMonths 1, 3, 6, and 12 - Observational follow-up visits per protocol design.",

    "detailed_description": "Open-label, single arm, phase II trial initially pursuing a two-stage Simon Minimax design. The null hypothesis Po will be 0.20; the alternative hypothesis Pa will be 0.40 (type 1 error will be 0.05 and type 2 error will be 0.10).\n\nPatients with metastatic CRPC tumours characterised by high mutational load, high microsatellite instability as established, for example, by the Promega MSI 1.2 analysis system, or a DNA repair defect including loss of MMR, identified on archival or fresh tissue biopsy specimens (through a TMG approved sequencing study e.g. the MAESTRO study) who have either exhausted established active anticancer drugs, or preferred not to have established agents, will be offered entry into the PERSEUS1 study.\n\nPart A: Part A is an open-label, single arm, two-stage Simon Minimax design phase II trial.\n\nStage 1: Patients will continue their LHRH analogue therapy. This cohort will include 24 patients as the first stage of a two-stage Phase II. If more than 5 responses in these first 24 patients are reported then the study will proceed to stage 2. Anti-tumour activity will be assessed (measured by response rates) by PSA, imaging assessments (CT \\& bone scans or when indicated whole body MRI) and CTC count measures. Whole Body MRI (WB-MRI) will be performed instead of CT in patients with contraindications to CT contrast), or instead of bone scan in patients with widespread bone disease at baseline thought to be non-evaluable by PCWG criteria due to inability to reliably identify two new lesions.\n\nStage 2: This will enrol a further 21 patients to a total of 45 patients. Ineffectiveness will be concluded if \u22645 and \u226413 responses are seen in the stage 1 and stage 2 respectively and the null hypothesis will be rejected (i.e. further research would be warranted) if \\>13 responses are reported from the first 45 patients.\n\nWith this Simon Minimax design the probability of early termination of this trial when the true response probability (P0) is \\<0.20 is 0.66.\n\nPart B: Biomarker enrichment stage: If the null hypothesis is rejected (and with Sponsor approval and confirmation of sufficient funding) the study will continue with stratified recruitment into biomarker defined cohorts in order to increase the precision with which the response rate can be estimated within mCRPC molecular subgroups of interest. It is anticipated that approximately 55 patients will be included in Part B, which will make a total of 100 mCRPC patients in part A and B together, including \u22659 patients for each of:\n\nA) MMR defective mCRPC; B) High mutational load mCRPC without MMR defects; C) mCRPC with deleterious homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair aberrations (BRCA2, ATM, BRCA1, PALB2, others); D) mCRPC with deleterious nucleotide excision repair (NER) aberrations; E) mCRPC with deleterious base excision repair (BER) aberrations; F) mCRPC with deleterious aberrations in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ).\n\nEligibility for more than one cohort is anticipated to be uncommon; where this occurs \"allocation\" to a cohort will be determined in discussion with the CI based on initial sequencing results and with priority given to driver (rather than sub-clonal) mutations. Patients recruited in Part A will be retrospectively \"allocated\" to a cohort on the basis of their initial sequencing data (reported prior to trial entry) prior to any response assessments, for the purposes of analysis. Within each biomarker subgroup (A-F) this will allow us to reject the probability of a \\>30% response rate if we see no responses in 9-patients, with a 5% false negative risk (Gehan design). If \u22651 responses are seen in 9 patients in a subtype, recruitment will continue to that subtype with a further 20-25 patients such that the final estimate of the response rate has a standard error of 10%. Response rates with confidence intervals will be reported for each subtype.\n\nIn the absence of any safety concerns from the IDMC, recruitment will continue seamlessly from Part A stage 1 to Part A stage 2 and from Part A stage 2 to the Part B biomarker enrichment cohorts. It is possible that at the time of the Part A stage 1 and 2 overall analysis (based on 45 patients), the graduation of some of the more common subgroups to the enrichment phase will be known (e.g. if more than 1 response from 9 patients recruited to a biomarker subgroup that cohort would continue to at least 20 patients). Conversely, if no successes have been seen in 9 patients of a particular subtype, recruitment to that subtype would not proceed to the enrichment stage.\n\nThe biomarker defined cohorts may accrue at different rates related to genomic prevalence. At each stop/go decision point (end of enrichment stage 1 in a particular cohort) overall progress of all the ongoing enrichment cohorts will be reviewed by the IDMC/TSC. They will be asked to advise on the value of continued accrual to the cohorts particularly in light of slow recruitment.",

In France, since the beginning of the vaccination campaign, 54,266,859 people have received at least one injection (ie. 80.5% of the total population), 53,354,698 people now have a complete vaccination schedule (ie. 79.1% of the total population) and since the beginning of the booster campaign, 39,558,416 people have received a 1st booster dose.\n\nHowever, the data currently available on the persistence of immunity on the one hand, and the appearance of viral variants with reduced sensitivity to vaccine immunity on the other, suggest the need to administer booster doses at variable intervals depending on age and comorbidities. Real-life efficacy data from France and around the World confirm that people who have received a booster dose are better protected than those who have only received a primary vaccination schedule (HAS).\n\nIn this context, the Ministry of Health, has pronounced on the possibility of administering a second booster dose for people aged 60 and over. Moreover, the recommendations for the Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9 for the 2nd booster dose in general population should be available in June 2022.\n\nThree vaccines, mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, Sanofi/GSK monovalent D614 and B.1.351 formulations were administered as 1st booster in the CoviBOOST trial. All three vaccines boosted antibodies and neutralizing response after a BNT162b2 initial course. Heterologous boosting with the Sanofi/GSK SARS-CoV-2 recombinant adjuvanted protein vaccine B.1.351 (Beta formulation) provided higher rates of neutralizing antibodies against variants, including Omicron BA.1, compared with the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. Due to the start of the study after the beginning of booster vaccination campaign in elderly, the enrollment of participants over 65 years of age was difficult so, only 8 subjects aged 60 years and over were enrolled. As vaccine immunogenicity is lower in older populations and is waning more rapidly, it is important to evaluate the adjuvanted vaccine in this population.\n\nThe objective of this ancillary study is to compare, in participants aged of 60 years and older and previously vaccinated with 3 doses of mRNA vaccine (2 doses of Pfizer BioNTech) and a 3rd dose of Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna, the immunogenicity of a second booster dose of the B.1.351 strain recombinant protein- based subunit vaccine to BNT162b2 (mRNA Pfizer BioNTech Vaccine).These results will provide important information for booster vaccination recommendations in this age group.",

Real-life efficacy data from France and around the World confirm that people who have received a booster dose are better protected than those who have only received a primary vaccination schedule (HAS).\n\nCurrently available data from the United States and the United Kingdom show that the protection conferred by the first booster dose diminishes after 3 months, particularly in persons 60 years of age and older, and justified the recommendation of a second booster dose.\n\nData from Israel show that a second booster dose (4th dose) reduces the rate of confirmed infections by a factor of 2 and the rate of severe disease by a factor of 4. The safety data, although limited, are reassuring.\n\nIn this context, the Ministry of Health, has pronounced on the possibility of administering a second booster dose for people aged 60 and over. Moreover, the recommendations for the Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9 for the 2nd booster dose in general population should be available in June 2022.\n\nThe vaccines currently recommended in France, for booster vaccination are mRNA vaccines. However, some vaccines that were developed later in the clinic could present an interesting alternative in terms of reactogenicity, accessibility, cost and acceptability. Moreover, a heterologous vaccination scheme could be more immunogenic than a homologous scheme. Therefore, it is important to be able to evaluate these vaccines as a second booster dose.\n\nThe COVID 19 vaccines developed by Sanofi are based on a classical adjuvanted recombinant protein approach. Three candidate vaccines are under development, one based on the Spike protein of the SARS CoV-2 D614 strain, the other on the B.1.351 strain, and the third is a vaccine combining the two.\n\nThree vaccines, mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, Sanofi/GSK monovalent D614 and B.1.351 formulations were administered as 1st booster in the CoviBOOST trial.

Rapid and reliable monitoring of anti-TB treatment adherence and efficacy is critical to provide adequate patient care and curb relapse episodes and acquired drug resistance.\n\nInvestigators propose to evaluate the performance in terms of diagnosis accuracy and outcome prediction of four new biomarkers of active TB: 1) a double IGRA (Interferon Gamma Release Assay) including QuantiFERON-Gold Plus\u00ae and HBHA; 2) a whole blood transcriptomic analysis of mRNA (messenger Ribonucleic acid) expression of a panel of 150 genes; 3) a whole blood proteomic analysis; 4) an ex vivo immunophenotyping using flow and mass cytometry to characterize the lymphocyte populations.",

    "brief_summary": "After definitive radiotherapy (RT) treatment (with or without chemotherapy), cervical and anal canal neoplasms frequently exhibit disease persistence or recurrence. Due to the local inflammatory process post-treatment, response assessment by imaging (current gold standard) is limited, often necessitating multiple follow-ups and repeated invasive biopsies. Conventional follow-up is complex and costly, requiring equipment from secondary and tertiary services, trained radiologists, and patient exposure to radiation and contrast.\n\nIn this context of human papillomavirus(HPV)-related neoplasms, recent studies have demonstrated the role of ctDNA (circulating tumor DNA) in assessing the risk of recurrence or disease progression, providing a rationale for using the tool in two fronts:\n\n* Optimizing follow-up based on serial monitoring of ctDNA;\n* Selecting patients with positive ctDNA after RT, who are at high risk of recurrence, for treatment intensification.\n\nMonitoring with ctDNA as a standalone follow-up tool in cases evolving with negative ctDNA after RT has the potential to replace imaging exams, being a minimally invasive test performed on a peripheral blood sample. Currently, ctDNA testing has expensive methodologies not available in the Unified Health System (SUS). This project aims to develop a methodology for ctDNA evaluation focused on HPV ctDNA research that is low-cost and executable in SUS, as well to assess the accuracy of this test in the population with HPV-related tumors.\n\nAdditionally, we will evaluate whether the early introduction of immunotherapy in patients with positive ctDNA after definitive treatment can increase cure rates. Immunotherapy already has a well-defined role in the treatment of metastatic HPV-related neoplasms. Recently, the use of anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD1) has also shown benefits in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer with a high risk of recurrence who are candidates for chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Therefore, its use focused on HPV-related tumors, as well as a better understanding of which patients benefit from this strategy, warrants further investigation.",
    "detailed_description": "The ANA study is a research project aimed at enhancing the treatment and outcomes for patients with cervical and anal canal cancer by using innovative diagnostic and therapeutic methods. The study consists of the following phases:\n\n* Patient identification and selection;\n* Recruitment of patients diagnosed with cervical or anal canal cancer who are candidates for treatment with radiotherapy (RT), with or without chemotherapy: patients will be selected based on specific criteria to ensure a representative cohort;\n* Development and validation of the ctDNA HPV Test: development of a sensitive and specific test to detect HPV DNA in the blood. This test will undergo rigorous validation to ensure its accuracy and reliability;\n* ctDNA monitoring: blood samples collection from patients during treatment and follow-up. ctDNA levels will be monitored in real-time to early detection of residual or recurrent disease. This non-invasive method aims to provide a more accurate assessment of treatment efficacy and disease progression. The results of ctDNA will be compared with traditional imaging methods.\n* Complementary immunotherapy treatment: patients with positive ctDNA results after (chemo)radiotherapy will be considered for additional immunotherapy. This phase will evaluate the benefits of combining immunotherapy with standard (chemo)radiotherapy in order to improve patient outcomes;\n* Follow-up and outcome evaluation: long-term follow-up of patients to assess clinical outcomes, including survival and quality of life.\n\nThe ANA study aims to set new standards in the follow-up and management of HPV-related cervical and anal canal cancer by improving patient care within the Brazilian public health system (SUS).",

To test this hypothesis, a vitamin E functionalized dark chocolate rich in polyphenols will be developed with the collaboration of Nestl\u00e8 Company, and its effects will be investigated combined with physical activity in a 6-month randomized case-control trial on pre-dementia elderly patients, a well-defined population of subjects at risk of undernutrition and frailty. Subjects stabilized on a protein-rich diet (0.9-1.0 g protein/Kg ideal body weight/day) and physical exercise program (High Intensity Interval Training specifically developed for these subjects), will be randomized in 3 groups (n = 34 each): controls (Group A) will maintain the baseline diet and cases will receive either 30 g/day of dark chocolate containing 500 mg total polyphenols (corresponding to 60 mg epicatechin) and 100 mg vitamin E (as RRR-alpha-tocopherol) (Group B) or the high polyphenol chocolate without additional vitamin E (Group C). Diet will be isocaloric and with the same intake of polyphenols and vitamin E in the 3 groups. Muscle mass will be the primary endpoint and other clinical endpoints will include neurocognitive status and previously identified biomolecular indices of frailty in pre-dementia patients. Muscle biopsies will be collected to assess myocyte contraction and mitochondrial metabolism. Laboratory endpoints will include the nutritional compliance to the proposed intervention (blood polyphenols and vitamin E status and metabolism), 24-h salivary cortisol, steroid hormones and IGF-1, and molecular indices of inflammation, oxidant stress, cell death and autophagy. These parameters will be investigated in muscle and blood cells by state-of-the-art omics techniques. Molecular and nutritional findings will also be confirmed in vitro using skeletal myotubes, blood leukocytes and neural cell lines. Clinical and laboratory results will be processed by a dedicated bioinformatics platform (developed with the external collaboration of the omics company Molecular Horizon Srl) to interpret the molecular response to the nutritional intervention and to personalize its application.",
    "detailed_description": "BACKGROUND Older adults are particularly vulnerable to undernutrition, a state resulting from defective food intake or uptake (nutrient deficiencies) leading to altered body composition and weight loss. Muscle wasting is a major drawback of this condition and a symptom of protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) and metabolic reprogramming of tissues that increase the ageing process. These changes sustain insulin resistance and impaired mitochondrial metabolism of critical organs and tissues, including skeletal muscle. Prevention of undernutrition is critical. Undernutrition correlates with an accelerated and general decline in health conditions (worsening both physical and cognitive/mental aspects), thus increasing the risk of frailty and finally accelerating physical and cognitive decline. Under these circumstances, the majority of people experience a significant loss of locomotor function, with a significant decline in quality of life, and a high risk of falls which often represents the terminal event in life. These factors can lower the frailty threshold for the oldest-old, with the consequent loss of adaptability, which is an essential feature of successful ageing. This process of deteriorating mobility is multifactorial and also includes decline in cognitive function, increased bone fragility, and reduced joint flexibility.\n\nStrong evidence suggests that ageing and cognitive decline are associated with dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis), with a clear increase in cortisol levels. The effects of hypercortisolism are far-reaching, affecting the skeletal muscle widely, thus leading to significant sarcopenia and fragility. It is well known that HPA axis activity is impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. This dysregulation induces an increase in cortisol levels. High levels of cortisol, one of the most catabolic hormones, also lead to noticeable sarcopenia. Mechanistic aspects include antagonistic effects on the insulin axis (secondary insulin resistance) and consequent metabolic reprogramming of tissues to gluconeogenesis sustained by non-carbohydrate precursors that include amino acids derived from the proteolytic degradation of muscle proteins. Comorbidity in frail people can further sustain the secretion and metabolic effects of cortisol, especially undernutrition and PEM. Some of us previously showed that cortisol levels are significantly higher in patients with AD and severity of the behavioural symptoms, and more importantly, changes in body mass, significantly correlated with cortisol levels. Therefore, cortisol levels, which are not regularly evaluated in AD patients, would help predict patients at risk of weight loss.\n\nMoreover, recent findings revealed a significant decrease in cortisol levels in response to chronic physical activity in healthy individuals and patients with dementia. Physical activity treatment (PT) is a non-pharmacological treatment with great potential to attenuate the cognitive decline in healthy elderly. In patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) it was observed that 6 months of PT significantly ameliorates BMI, 6' Walking Test (6MWT), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Importantly, PT may preferably be undertaken as high aerobic intensity (85-95% of maximal heart rate) intervals (HIT), as this yields superior effects on the cardiovascular system compared with PT of moderate or low intensity. HIT has successfully been applied in older individuals (8,9), and in frail populations such as patients with heart failure.\n\nAlong with physical activity, macro and micronutrients, are reported to interact with the activity of HPA-axis and to help reducing cortisol levels. Chocolate polyphenols appear to have significant effects with impact on both mental well-being and metabo-inflammatory symptoms of chronic exposure to such stress hormone (3,11-13). Cocoa-derived flavonoids can lower the levels of the active hormone cortisol. Mechanistically, these natural molecules inhibit 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11\u03b2-HSD) type 1, an enzyme involved in reducing cortisone to the active form cortisol. The intake of these and many other micronutrients and homeostatic factors decrease with aging due to general worsening of quantity and quality of food intake. Together with micronutrients, protein intake is a critical aspect and a major risk factor for PEM and frailty. Nutritional supplementation for frail people has been shown to slow their functional decline, improving both muscle mass and strength, particularly if this is combined with physical activity. It is now established that nutritional recommendations, including adequate protein and micronutrient intake, are important for a better quality of life in the elderly, which is common management approach of older people who are frail or at risk for developing frailty.\n\nVitamin E is a fat-soluble essential micronutrient with unique properties as antioxidant and cell protection factor. It is present in cellular membranes of all tissues to scavenge peroxyl radicals formed by free radical attack on polyunsaturated fatty acids. This function is particularly important to prevent mitochondrial damage and the uncontrolled release of free radicals from these organelles in the muscle. Its intake and function as cell protection factor and immune system modulator can be compromised in the elderly (20); moreover, preclinical and human experimental studies show that vitamin E positively influences myoblast proliferation, differentiation, survival, membrane repair, mitochondrial efficiency, muscle mass, muscle contractile properties, and exercise capacity. Furthermore, recent studies on the human metabolism of vitamin E demonstrated that the biotransformation of this vitamin in human tissues forms bioavailable long-chain metabolites with a role as tissue detoxification (PXR and PPAR-gamma agonist activity) and anti-inflammatory (LOX-5 inhibition) mediators. Therefore, for multiple reasons, vitamin E supplementation in the diet as a measure to support physical training in preventing age-associated PEM is worth investigating.\n\nAIMS The study aims to investigate if regular consumption of vitamin E-functionalized and polyphenol-rich chocolate can support physical exercise high-protein diet to slow down the progression of protein-energy undernutrition in pre-dementia elderly people. Specifically, the primary aim is to investigate whether regular consumption of vitamin E-functionalized and polyphenol-rich chocolate and regular exercise practice boost lower limb muscle mass in pre-dementia elderly people. The secondary aims are to investigate the effect of regular consumption of vitamin E-functionalized and polyphenol-rich chocolate and regular exercise practice on muscle strength, cognitive function, vascular function, metabolic and physical functions, as well as mitochondrial respiration, circadian cortisol curve, blood hormones, and inflammatory status in blood and mRNA in pre-dementia elderly people.\n\nPROCEDURE The study will be a randomized, double blinded, controlled trial with parallel groups including active control and shame groups. One hundred and fifty individuals with MCI and subjective cognitive decline without functional deficits will be screened for eligibility and those that comply with inclusion and exclusion criteria will be confirmed and the informed consent will be allocated for testing and undergo preliminary evaluations (T00). After preliminary evaluation, all the individuals included in the study will undergo a 4 to 6-week \"Run-in\" phase during which the high protein diet (HPro) will be introduced and all subjects will be trained to implement the High-Intensity Training physical exercise (HIT) program that will be developed during the study. Immediately after the \"Run-in\", a pre-intervention (T0) evaluation will be undertaken. Consequently, participants stabilized on the HPro Diet + HIT which will be the common treatment for all participants, will be randomly assigned (utilizing an online statistical computing web program) to one of the three arms of the nutritional intervention in which the effect of vitamin E (VE) will be investigated separate or combined with the effect of chocolate polyphenols (HPP) compared to control treatment. The intervention will last six months; assessments will be performed after three months (halfway through the intervention) and at the end of the intervention (T1 and T2, respectively). A follow-up assessment will be performed three months after the end of the intervention after the restoration of baseline diet and physical activity conditions (T3). Each group will include 34 participants; a 20% dropout has been estimated based on previous studies.\n\nSAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION Considering an alpha = 0.05, a power = 0.8 and the 20% of estimated drop out, we aim to recruit 102 subjects (34 in each group). Main outcome is \"muscle mass\", and for all the groups treatment duration will be 6 months. In 6 months in the target population the loss of muscle mass is assumed to be 1.0-1.5% (+/- 0.5%) \\[5\\] \\[48\\]. In Control group (Group A), which includes people undergoing targeted exercise, the expected increase is 2% 1.5% (+-0.5%) \\[5\\] \\[48\\]. In treatment groups (Groups B and C) the median average expected increase at second follow-up is 4% 2% (+-0.5%), and 1.5% 4% (+-0.5%) at 6 months \\[6\\] \\[49\\]. The rate of lost at follow-up, derived from previous studies, is 20% (+-2%) \\[7\\] \\[50\\]. Correlation between repeated measures is assumed to be 0.5, variance explained by the between-subjects effect 6.25 and error variance 65.\n\nAll estimates were performed using Stata v.16.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) by \"power repeated\" command.\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS Statistical analysis will be conducted under the supervision of an expert in biostatistics (dr Gili, at Coordinator Unit) and with the support of LIPOSTAR software provided by external collaborator C2. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA, including age and gender as covariates, with \"time\" as within-group factor and \"treatment\" as between-groups factor will be utilized to calculate difference between groups. In the presence of significant effects, a multiple comparisons tests with Bonferroni's correction will be performed. The familywise alpha level for significance will be set at 0.05 (two-tails), with Bonferroni's correction when needed, for all the analyses.\n\nSIDE EFFECTS Sides effects may be related to the assessment procedures: strength, voluntary activation, and electrically evoked potential tests may cause muscle soreness and discomfort during the procedures. In case of persistent discomfort the procedure will be immediately stopped. Also, side effect might be caused by blood draw and muscle biopsy: subjects may experience some side effects related to the blood draw in the draw site, which normally gets between the following days. Also, subjects may experience some soreness in the site of the biopsy, muscle tightness and fatigue in the few days after biopsy was taken. In the case of these events, subject will be monitored and the family doctor will be informed.\n\nDATA AND SAFETY MONITORING COMMITTEE A log-diary will be kept by each participant and will be checked weekly by the investigators and collaborators. In the diary participants will include information about possible adverse events caused by assessment procedures or related to the diet and training, any important points about the response to the interventions, any possible discomfort experienced during or after the training, or notes regarding diet and supplementation. Prof. Gianluca-Svegliati Baroni of the Gastroenterology Division of the University Hospital of Ancona, Italy will serve as external scientific supervisor of the clinical trial. He is an expert in clinical and preclinical studies of human nutrition and metabolism. He will advise on specific Code: CHOKO-AGE Data: 10/06/2021 Version:1 30 tasks and monitor the different phases of clinical trial from organization to implementation of activities, data gathering and evaluation/interpretation. The quality assurance standards of University of Verona will be adopted to monitor the clinical trial. A delegate of this University will be nominated to perform the monitoring of the different phases of the trial utilizing internal SOPs. The entire set of clinical procedures, operator's activity and collection of experimental data will be verified during a series of visits by the monitor that will occur at the beginning and the end of each time point in the study (Time T00 to T3).",

    "detailed_description": "Royal jelly is a substance produced in the hypopharyngeal glands of bees that operate young, and rich in bioactive compounds such as polyphenols, free fatty acids and exclusive peptides capable of mitigating inflammation and premature aging (genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, shortening of telomeres) existing in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis. However, to date there are no studies evaluating the effects of royal jelly on such complications in patients with RDC. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of royal jelly on inflammation and cellular senescence in patients with CKD. Methods: Clinical, longitudinal, randomized study, with washout and crossover period. Patients with CKD on HD received 140 mL bottles containing propolis and turmeric, and were instructed to take 10 mL/day (dosing cup), containing a dose equivalent to 110 mg/day of standardized green propolis extract (EPP-AF) plus 130 mg of curcuminoids/day or placebo for 8 weeks. After this supplementation, patients will enter the washout period (8 weeks) and after this period, the intervention group will receive placebo and vice versa. The collection of biological material (blood and feces) will be done before and after each study period. The mRNA expression of the transcription factors Nrf2 and NF-\u03baB, as well as their target genes, antioxidant enzymes, inflammatory cytokines and the expression of genes and proteins that modulate the protein will be evaluated using rtPCR, western blotting and assay methods. multiplex. Uremic toxins from the intestinal microbiota such as indoxyl sulfate (IS), p-cresyl sulfate (p-CS) and Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) will be confirmed by HPLC and plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels will be analyzed by ELISA. The determination of antioxidant capacity will be determined by the FRAP, ORAC AND DPPH methods. The analysis of the composition of the intestinal microbiota will be evaluated by high-throughput sequencing of the V4-V5 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Nutritional status and dietary intake will also be assessed.",

Alterations of mitochondrial energy metabolism may intervene in PD pathogenesis by inducing inflammation, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and neurodegeneration. The Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a regulator both of mitochondrial function and biogenesis, and of cellular resistance to oxidative stress, and may represent a novel target of PD disease-modifying therapies.\n\nThe aims of the present study are to validate indicators of energy metabolism as biomarkers in PD patients and to evaluate the efficacy of drugs and natural food supplements acting on the Nrf2 pathway in improving motor impairment and Gait in PD patients.",
    "detailed_description": "Bradykinesia, causing impairment of gait and an associated significant risk of falls, is among the most debilitating core features of Parkinson\u00bfs disease (PD), a movement disorder characterized by the degeneration of Substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons. The pacemaking action potential firing activity of nigral neurons requires high energy consumption and is coupled to large cytosolic calcium oscillations, which influence mitochondrial respiration, energy metabolism, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Mitochondrial dysfunction, on the other hand, can drive dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, especially in dopaminergic neurons, and is recognized as a key component in PD progression. Notably, both calcium-binding and increased ROS production, resulting from inefficiencies in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, can trigger alpha-synuclein aggregation, thus contributing to neuronal loss and disease progression in PD. The Nuclear factor erythroid 2- related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a regulator of mitochondrial function and biogenesis, and cellular resistance to oxidative stress. Bioactive compounds activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway ameliorate Parkinsonian phenotypes in experimental models, suggesting the Nrf2 pathway potential novel therapeutic target in PD.\n\nBradykinesia, causing impairment of gait and an associated significant risk of falls, is among the most debilitating core features of PD. PD gait is characterized by shuffling steps accompanied by a stooped posture. In advanced PD, other complications may arise such as disturbances in speech, gait, posture, and balance, as well as hypomimia, impaired decision-making, alertness, and regulation of emotions.\n\nThe increased energy demand associated with bradykinesia is coupled with the impairment of energy metabolism in Parkinsonians, negatively affecting walking, gait, and postural stability, suggesting that the modulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism may ameliorate gait and postural stability in Parkinsonians. Cardinal symptoms of PD: Tremors, Rigidity, Bradykinesia, and postural instability, all elements that lead in almost all patients to a walking disorder. In fact, walking in Parkinson's disease is present since in the early stages of the disease, the step is reduced in length and speed, the swinging phase of the step (swing) is reduced, while the support (Stance) single and double is increased in duration. Progression as well as the severity of disease over time, leads to a significant increase in the risk of falls, inducing a reduction in autonomy in daily living activity. As mentioned Gait is influenced in a principal way. Bipedal walking, in humans, is well orchestrated, consistent with the intrinsic \"kinetic melody\". This \"melody\" in subjects with PD is altered appears clear that the analysis of the gait represents a key element for establishing functional recovery therapies aimed at restoring motor skills. Therefore, it seems sensible to hypothesize that energy metabolism parameters may represent reliable biomarkers in PD and that the Nrf2 pathway may be a new therapeutic target for the recovery of motor function in PD patients. Not only that, but the identification of reliable biomarkers that are easy to measure over time can aid in the diagnosis, and possible prognosis, and improve management.\n\nIn support of this view, PD pathogenesis is known to involve the loss of the homeostatic functions controlling mitochondrial energy metabolism. The transcription factor Nrf2 is a master controller of these functions. Notably, Nrf2 activity is compromised during aging and in neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that energy metabolism parameters may represent reliable biomarkers in PD and that the Nrf2 pathway may be a novel therapeutic target for the rescue of motor function in Parkinsonians.\n\nThe identification of reliable biomarkers, easy to measure over time, is fundamental to facilitating diagnosis, prognosis, and better management of PD patients. The proposed study on PD patients will provide information immediately transferable to the clinical practice. Additionally, the clinical trial planned in the present project will provide substantial information regarding the effectiveness of different pharmacological approaches targeting the Nrf2 pathway in ameliorating gait and balance in Parkinsonians, thus reducing the substantial social and economic burden of PD to society, patients, and caregivers. Many drugs and natural food supplements acting on the Nrf2 pathway are available; therefore, the transfer to the clinical practice of the results of the present project is expected to be rapid.",

The identification of effective drugs is the main unmet clinical need. Changes in liver histones methylation accompanies the development and progression of NAFLD. Our preliminary data demonstrate that inactivation of the methyltransferases SUV420H1/2 in hepatocytes protects mice against NAFLD. In this project we propose to examine the relevance of these findings by evaluating the impact of genetic deletion of hepatic SUV420H1/2 in mice fed a steatogenic diet. To further evaluate the potential for clinical translation of these results, we will next 1) evaluate the expression of SUV420H1/2 in human liver transcriptomic data and 2) analyze the impact of genetic variations on disease outcomes in population-based cohorts; 3) test an innovative therapeutic approach based on hepatocyte-targeted antisense oligonucleotides downregulating SUV420H1/2 in human liver organoids/assembloids.",
    "detailed_description": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the leading cause of liver damage worldwide, is characterized by liver fat accumulation and association with insulin resistance, and frequently progresses to steatohepatitis (NASH), ultimately leading to cirrhosis and liver cancer.\n\nNAFLD/NASH is becoming globally a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality and by altering liver function contributes more widely to the burden of cardiometabolic, renal and neoplastic diseases. In the presence of concomitant hepatotoxic factors such as in particular atrisk alcohol intake and some medications (defined in this case as metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease or MAFLD) synergizes with them representing a major driver of liver disease progression. However, for those with advanced disease or who cannot successfully change their diet and lifestyle, no effective treatment is yet available to prevent or treat this condition, which is therefore projected to become a major public health threat in the next decade. Although understanding the mechanisms of NAFLD development and progression is essential for its prevention/treatment, molecular players involved in its progression are poorly defined. Recently, an epigenetic component is recognized in this disorder and the histone methyltransferases SUV420H1/2 are promising candidates for this function. Multiple evidences connect lipid and iron metabolism in the hepatocyte: 1) Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in human populations showed an overlap of loci affecting iron and lipid metabolism, and excess iron in hepatocytes favors dyslipidemia and NAFLD; 2) upregulation of the liver hormone hepcidin, under the control by the BMP-SMAD pathway, is protective against NAFLD-NASH. Interestingly, a GWAS performed in mouse strains kept on high-iron diet identified a shared association between liver iron and triglyceride levels at a region of chromosome 7 encompassing the histone methyltransferase Suv420h2. Our preliminary data show that mice with Suv420h inactivation in adipose tissue are resistant to diet-induced liver steatosis due to increased PPAR signaling. Since mice with liver BMP-SMAD pathway upregulation showed Suv420h downregulation, we hypothesize that the protective effect of increased hepatocyte BMP-SMAD signaling on NAFLD development is due to Suv420h. In agreement, Suv420h inactivation in hepatocytes counteracts diet-induced NAFLD, as highlighted by our preliminary results.\n\nThe present study is part of the RF project (Ricerca Finalizzata) - Project code: RF-2021-12373889 funded by the grant call of the Ministery of Health (2020-2021). In the attached project we proposed 3 different aims:\n\n* To characterize the disease progression in Suv420h1/2-liver conditional KO mice and to identify\n* To examine the impact of SUV420H1/2 genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional variability on clinical outcomes for the identification of novel biomarkers of NAFLD-NASH.\n* To propose and test an innovative therapeutic approach based on hepatocyte-targeted antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against Suv420h1/2 in preclinical models in mice and in human liver organoids and assembloids. The present clinical study protocol will focus on the clinical aspects and procedures that will regard an intervention on data and sample of clinical cohorts.

Subjects will then receive standard of care (planned 6 weeks) radiation therapy (RT) and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) at a standard targeted dose of 75 mg/m2/day.\n\nThe study cycle of TMZ comprises a targeted dose of 150-200mg/m2/day for 5 days every 4 (+2) weeks for up to 12 cycles (patients with unmethylated MGMT gene promoter will receive only cycle 1). All patients will receive up to a total of 10 DC vaccines called pp65 CMV dendritic cells (DC). Dendritic Cell (DC) vaccines #1-3 will be given every two weeks, thus delaying the initiation of TMZ cycle 2 for patients receiving TMZ. All remaining TMZ/vaccine cycles will be 4 (+2) weeks in length.\n\nAfter the first 3 DC vaccines given during Cycle 1 of TMZ, the remaining DC vaccine injections are given on Day 21 (+/- 2 days) of each TMZ cycle. Subjects with unmethylated MGMT will only receive one cycle of adjuvant TMZ; however, their vaccine schedule will follow the same 4 (+ 2) week TMZ cycle schedule.\n\nFollowing RT, patients will be randomized into 1 of 3 groups. Groups 1 and 2 will be blinded. The groups differ in the type of pre-conditioning received prior to DC vaccine #4; additionally, Group 3 will be receiving infusions of varlilumab 7 days prior to and with vaccine #1 and 7 days prior to vaccine #3+. The pre-conditioning for each group is as follows: Group 1: Unpulsed DC pre-conditioning prior to DC vaccine #4; Group 2: Tetanus-diphtheria (Td) pre-conditioning prior to DC vaccine #4; Group 3: Td pre-conditioning prior to DC vaccine #4 and varlilumab infusion at 7 days prior to each DC vaccine (except DC vaccine #2) with Td pre-conditioning prior to vaccine #4.",
    "detailed_description": "Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common endemic \u03b2-Herpesvirus, and over half of adults have been infected with CMV. CMV does not usually cause significant clinical disease but can cause health problems for people with weakened immune systems. Expression of proteins unique to human CMV has been reported within a large proportion of malignant gliomas (MGs), including detection of the human CMV immunodominant protein pp65-LAMP (pp65-lysosomal-associated membrane protein). Human CMV antigens were not detected in surrounding normal brain samples. The presence of highly-immunogenic human CMV antigens within MGs affords a unique opportunity to target these tumors immunologically.\n\nDendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells in the immune system. DCs are activated then migrate to the lymph nodes to interact with T cells and B cells, which initiates the adaptive immune response. This study generates autologous DCs from peripheral blood leukocytes obtained from the subject during leukapheresis. RNA transfection is the method used in this study for loading antigens onto DCs. DCs are pulsed with human CMV pp65-LAMP mRNA.\n\nTetanus-diphtheria (Td) toxoid is used for active immunization in children and adults against infection with the bacteria Clostridium tetani and Corynebacterium diphtheria. It is thought that Td toxoid induces an inflammatory milieu within the intradermal vaccine site, thereby promoting the migration of injected tumor-specific DCs. Additionally, in the context of vaccinating the host with tumor-derived peptides, conditioning the vaccine site with Td toxoid has demonstrated enhanced immunogenicity with these peptides. Previous trials have suggested that giving the Td prior to immunotherapy may help improve the effectiveness of the DC vaccine by activating the immune response. This study will further examine whether Td helps activate the immune response by comparing subjects who receive Td pre-conditioning to subjects who receive autologous unpulsed DCs as pre-conditioning.\n\nVarlilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets CD27, a critical molecule in the activation pathway of lymphocytes. Varlilumab is an agonist anti-CD27 mAb that has been shown to activate human T cells in the context of T cell receptor stimulation. In pre-clinical models, varlilumab has been shown to mediate anti-tumor effects and may be particularly effective in combination with other immunotherapies. Anti-CD27 mAb has emerged as a novel costimulatory immune modulator that depletes TRegs without impairing activated effector T cells to improve antitumor immunity. We hypothesize that TReg inhibition through Varlilumab may increase polyfunctional immune responses to CMV.",

    "detailed_description": "The current worldwide epidemic of obesity puts millions of people at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and while insulin resistance has been a traditional focus of treatment, resistance to catecholamines in obesity is likely a key factor hampering weight loss efforts. Catecholamines are key drivers of lipolysis in adipose tissue and bind to beta-3 adrenergic receptors (ADRB3) on the surface of adipocytes. Chronic inflammation is characteristic of obesity and suppresses the expression of adipocyte ADRB3, increasing fat storage. This leaves adipose tissue metabolically inflexible and in a state of energy preservation instead of burning fat to promote and maintain weight loss. Thus, catecholamine resistance of adipose tissue is an important target for lifestyle and therapeutic intervention. Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a therapeutic intervention that promotes weight loss and healthier metabolism by aligning dietary intake with circadian rhythms. In this RCT, individuals with obesity will be enrolled in a 14-week study of TRE and behavioral nutritional counseling vs behavioral nutritional counseling alone. In the TRE group, dietary intake will be limited to a self-selected 10-hour window.

Accessing germinal center through fine needle aspirations under ultrasound guidance has recently emerged as an innovative strategy in the United States to investigate vaccine response. This procedure under local anesthesia is well-tolerated, and no major side effects have been reported in a hundred patients who underwent fine needle aspiration. The technical details for performing this examination are now well-described.\n\nOur previous work has highlighted the importance of repertoire diversity in responding to new variants of SARS-CoV-2. We thus aim to investigate whether a booster dose with mRNA or protein-based vaccine mobilizes memory B cells or naive cells, thereby contributing to a greater diversity of the Memory B cell comportment. To preserve the diversity of the memory B cell pool is absolutely essential for our immune system to adapt against variants.\n\nTo achieve this, we will perform lymph node fine needle aspiration of the draining lymph node in 6 subjects in each study arm, 3 to 6 weeks after the booster vaccine injection. Indeed, it has been shown that the response of germinal centers in response to a booster vaccination was detectable at 2- and 8-weeks post-injection vaccination.\n\nThis outpatient procedure will be performed by a radiologist under ultrasound guidance, aiming to collect 4 fine needle aspirations from 4 axillary draining lymph nodes under local anesthesia.

Additionally, the study will further explore the effect of BMD006 in combination with PD-1 treatment.\n\nIn Part 1, the trial plans to enroll approximately 16-31 patients and perform dose escalation in 6 dose groups, including BMD006 50 \u03bc g, 100 \u03bc g, 200 \u03bc g, 400 \u03bc g, 800 \u03bc g, and 1200 \u03bc g.After receiving the first treatment with BMD006 on D1, the patient completed a single treatment DLT observation (14 days) and was evaluated by the researchers to be safe and tolerable.They will enter multiple treatment DLT observation (14 days) and receive BMD006 treatment on D15 and D22, respectively. On D28, the patient will continue to receive QW treatment at the current dose level for 6 times, and then switch to Q3W treatment from the 11th week until 52 weeks after the first treatment or until the termination criteria are met (defined as: disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, loss to follow-up, death, or end of the study, whichever occurs first). At the same time as the patient enters the treatment period, the next dose group of patients will be initiated for single treatment and observation.\n\nConsidering the high safety of starting dose selection (1/20 of the human safety dose inferred from preclinical research data), the 50 \u03bc g group will adopt the method of accelerated titration, and one patient is planned to be enrolled.\n\nDuring the process of accelerated titration, if there are \u2265 2 levels of adverse events (TRAE) related to investigational product after treatment during the observation period of DLT, two more patients will be added at the current dose level, and the \"3+3\" mode will be changed from then on.\n\nDuring the dose escalation process, the investigator can decide whether to add additional dose levels based on the patient's safety evaluation results, as well as PK, PD, biomarker, and other test results (if available), to better explore the risks and benefits of the patient's exposure to the investigational product.\n\nAfter treatment, safety follow-up and long-term follow-up will be carried out for each patient according to the time specified in the protocol. All patients will receive remote follow-up (by phone, etc.) to assess the overall survival until 2 years after the first treatment or the end point of long-term follow-up (defined as withdrawal of informed consent, withdrawal from the study, loss to follow-up, death or the end of the study, whichever occurs first).\n\nDuring the study, sample collection and safety assessment of PK, PD and biomarkers will be conducted at the corresponding visit points. Tumor evaluation was performed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. Imaging examination was performed every 6 weeks 6 months after the first treatment, and every 9 weeks 6 months later until 2 years after the first treatment or the end point of long-term follow-up.\n\nWhen the dose escalation of Part 1 is completed and the MTD level ( RP2D of this study) is determined, the dose escalation exploration of BMD006 combined with PD-1 antibody will be carried out.\n\nThe dose of BMD006 is explored starting from the previous dose of RP2D, and the next dose was explored to RP2D. According to the \"3+3\" model, 3-6 patients were enrolled in each dose. The patient will receive BMD006 combined with PD-1 antibody treatment on D1, and BMD006 treatment on D8 and D15. The DLT observation period is 21 days. D21 is safe and tolerable according to the investigator's assessment. The patient will continue to be treated according to QW regimen for 6 times at the current dose level, and then change to q3w treatment from the 10th week until 52 weeks after the first treatment or reaching the standard of termination. During the study, patients will receive fixed dose treatment with PD-1 antibody until 52 weeks after the first treatment or reaching the standard of termination of treatment. When the patient enters the treatment period, the treatment and observation of patients in the next dose group will be started.",

    "brief_summary": "At present, the first-line standard treatment for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) is immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy. For patients who relapse within 6 months after first-line chemotherapy, conventionally recommended chemotherapy drugs include topotecan, irinotecan, gemcitabine, paclitaxel or vinorelbine, etc., but due to limited benefits to patients, patients are also recommended to participate in relevant clinical studies. New treatment methods are constantly being explored in second-line treatment, including fluzoparib combined with adebelimumab. The current status of second-line treatment is still worrying.\n\nSelinexor is a class of nuclear export selective inhibitors (SINEs) for the export protein receptor XPO1. PO1 promotes the transport of mRNA and cargo proteins, including tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs), hormone receptors (GRs), and immune response regulators. Selinexor covalently binds to the XPO1 protein, blocking the export of TSPs and GRs and accumulating them in the nucleus, preventing the translation of oncoprotein mRNA, stopping the cell cycle process, and initiating apoptosis. Multiple in vitro and in vivo studies have verified that selinexor combined with chemotherapy/radiotherapy/targeted therapy exhibits significant anti-tumor activity.\n\nThis study plans to use selinexor combined with adebrelimab and albumin-paclitaxel as a second-line treatment for ES-SCLC to explore the efficacy and safety of this regimen.",

Animal studies implicated excess perioperative release of CAs and PGs in facilitating cancer progression by affecting the malignant tissue, its local environment, and anti-metastatic immune functions. Congruently, animal studies conducted by the investigators indicate that combined use of the beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, and the prostaglandins inhibitor, etodolac - but neither drug separately - efficiently prevented post-operative metastatic development. Two recently conducted clinical trials, conducted by the investigators, in three medical centers in Israel, recruiting breast (n=38) and colorectal (n=34) cancer patients, assessing the safety and short-term efficacy of perioperative propranolol and etodolac treatment. Drugs were well tolerated, without severe adverse events. Importantly, molecular/biological analyses of the excised primary tumor indicated that drug treatment caused promising anti-metastatic transformations, as well as improvements in immune and inflammatory indices. These included (i) decreased tumor cell capacity to migrate, (ii) reduced pro-metastatic capacity of the malignant tissue, and (iii) improvement in immune infiltrating into the tumor (Paper published in Clinical Cancer Research, 2017). Herein, the investigators propose to conduct a double-blind placebo-controlled two-arm Phase II clinical trial in 200 colorectal cancer patients undergoing curative surgery in Israel. A perioperative 20-day drug treatment will be initiated 5 days before surgery. Primary outcomes will include (i) 3-year disease-free-survival (DFS), and 5-year overall survival (OS); and (ii) biological markers in blood samples, and in the excised tumor tissue. Secondary outcomes will include safety indices and psychological measures of depression, anxiety, distress, and fatigue",

Participants will be type 1 diabetes patients with and without gastroparesis. Investigators will investigate\n\n* Differences in nervefiber density and morphology\n* Cellular and transcriptional changes and indices of glucosemetabolism between groups",
    "detailed_description": "Aims To perform an exploratory cohort study including 26 type 1 diabetes (DM1) patients aged 18-85 years with gastroparesis and 26 comparable DM1 diabetes patients without gastroparesis, investigating nerve fibre density and length in the mucosal and submucosal layer of the stomach (fundus, and antrum). A variety of molecular, biochemical and cellular experimental procedures will be performed on bloodsamples and tissue biopsies collected during gastroscopy exploring the pathophysiology of gastroparesis. In addition, we will compare differences in, measures of glucose metabolism in the two patient groups through bloodsamples.\n\nHypotheses\n\n1. Nerve fibre morphology in the stomach is different in type 1 diabetes patients with diabetic gastroparesis compared to diabetes patient without gastroparesis and associated with differences in glucose metabolism and the severity of autonomic and peripheral neuropathy.\n2. Patients with gastroparesis show loss of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) in the gastric body, antrum and fundus and have marked morphological changes indicative of injuries.\n3. Macrophages are thought to play a central role in diabetic gastroparesis, in which a loss of anti-inflammatory heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) positive macrophages leads to decreased protection against oxidative stress, resulting in damage to ICCs.\n4. In gastroparesis there is increased presence of fibrosis in the stroma and alteration in inflammatory cells.\n5. Patients with gastroparesis may have decreased levels of neurotransmitters such as NO and substance P.\n6. Gastroparesis may cause pathological alterations of enteric glial and ganglion cells and the cytoplasm of smooth muscle cells.\n7. Patients with gastroparesis have lower pyloric distensibility.\n8. Examining transcriptional changes in between groups will reveal new genes associated with disease development. Newly developed in vitro models make it possible to explore and correlate molecular biochemical and cellular factors to disease development and progression.\n\nStudy Design All participants will be type 1 diabetes patients attending treatment at Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen (SDCC) or type 1 diabetes patients referred from other treatment facilities. Patients will fill out the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) questionnaire and be asked if they have been diagnosed with gastroparesis. Patients with known gastroparesis or with a GCSI score \u2265 1.9 without known gastroparesis will be subject to a technetium scintigraphy. Patients without established gastroparesis and a GCSI score \\< 1.9 will also undergo technetium scintigraphy. A gastric content above 10%, 4 hours after meal ingestion will be considered the diagnostic threshold for gastroparesis Patients with gastroparesis will be considered as cases and patients without gastroparesis as control. All patients will have a gastroscopy to rule out other causes to gastro-intestinal symptoms. During gastroscopy, 8 biopsies will be obtained and endo-flip will be used to measure distesibility in pylorus. Tissue specimens and blood samples will be collected and used in various research-based analyses to understand the pathophysiology.",

While these data would not have been worrisome in the Delta VOC era, this may be different with the emergence of the Omicron VOC.\n\nThese data raise the question of when and will a 4th dose be needed to cope with the emergence of Omicron. However, if a have reached the maximal effect of the current vaccine has been reached against Omicron, with a third dose, will a 4th dose have any added value?\n\nHere, the investigators will study the potential immunogenicity of a 4th dose, together with assessing safety and effectiveness in preventing infections",
    "detailed_description": "The aim of the study is to assess the immunogenicity of a 4th dose, and its durability. This will be measured by following IgG, IgA, Pseudoneutralization assays, microneutralization, avidity, T-cell activity and B-cell repertoire and comparing them to a matched control group, who are participating in the Sheba COVID Cohort study. The investigators will also assess safety and vaccine effectiveness by active surveillance of adverse events and by following incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nThis is a prospective intervention study, to test the effect of a 4th dose, by comparing the immune response before and after the 4th dose, given to 150-200 volunteers, as well as comparing their responses with a control group of individuals vaccinated with 3 doses but without the 4th. All study participants would be health care workers from Sheba medical Center, who are participating in the Sheba COVID Cohort study and have a serology test from the previous 3 months. Participation in the study will be confidential and will not be disclosed to the worker's direct supervisor. For this study, the investigators will recruit 150-200 volunteers, who received the 3rd dose at least 4 months previously, and have a known serology history (showing an immune response (even if just a low response) to the three previous doses, but with a recent relatively low IgG (below 700 BAU). Volunteers will tested before and after vaccination with a 4th dose, and followed for 6 months.\n\nAs controls, a sub-cohort of similar HCW, who are recruited to the Sheba COVID Cohort study (IRB 8008-20) and are followed monthly with serology tests, and are not receiving the 4th dose. The control group, all of whom signed an informed consent and allowed blood samples to be used for further immunologic studies, will be matched by age, gender, time from 3rd vaccine dose and IgG titers, and will be followed similarly, as by the original 8008-20 protocol.\n\nOn recruitment, volunteer will:\n\n1. Receive a detailed explanation and sign the informed consent form (appendix ICF)\n2. Fill an initial inclusion/ exclusion criteria questionnaire.\n3. Fill a general comorbidity questionnaire (Appendix Q1), additionally they will be screened for COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough, anosmia\n4. Have up to 40cc blood drawn for all serology and cellular immunity tests.\n5. Perform a PCR for SARS-CoV-2 test\n6. Receive the 4th dose of BNT162b2 30\u00b5g.\n7. Will have a physician checkup and followup for 15 minutes after receiving the dose.\n\nSix additional visits will follow as described in the research timeline:",

    "brief_summary": "SHIPSS is a multi-institutional, prospective, controlled, randomized, double-blinded interventional trial that will examine the potential benefits and risks of adjunctive hydrocortisone prescribed for children with fluid and vasoactive-inotropic refractory septic shock.\n\nIt is hypothesized that adjunctive hydrocortisone will significantly reduce the incidence of new and progressive organ dysfunction (primary outcome) and proportion of children with poor outcomes, defined as death or severely impaired health-related quality of life (HRQL) (secondary outcome), as assessed at 28 days following study enrollment (randomization).",
    "detailed_description": "Sepsis represents the most common cause of childhood mortality worldwide. In the United States alone, 200 cases of pediatric sepsis are diagnosed each day, with an associated hospital mortality rate of 5-10% and health care expenditures now approaching $5 billion annually. Moreover, nearly one third of children admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) for septic shock have not regained their baseline health-related quality of life one year following the sepsis event.\n\nDuring early resuscitation of the child with septic shock, in addition to antibiotics, volume replacement, and vasoactive-inotropic support, the most recent pediatric treatment guidelines advise the practitioner to consider adjunctive hydrocortisone therapy if the patient \"is at risk of absolute adrenal insufficiency or adrenal pituitary axis failure\". However, the potential benefits and risks of this recommendation have not been rigorously examined. On the one hand, corticosteroids are inexpensive and have been frequently demonstrated to improve hemodynamic status in children and adults with sepsis. Conversely, this drug class is known to alter transcription of approximately 30% of the human genome. Notably, corticosteroids down regulate most aspects of the immune response, but particularly adaptive immunity. Moreover, recent data suggests that children with particular gene expression profiles in sepsis have increased likelihood of mortality when treated with corticosteroids.\n\nSHIPSS (Stress Hydrocortisone In Pediatric Septic Shock) is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial examining the potential benefits and risks of adjunctive hydrocortisone prescribed to critically ill children with fluid and vasoactive-inotropic refractory septic shock. Up to 500 children will be enrolled, randomized, and evaluated at baseline, and 28 and 90 days following study enrollment.\n\nThe primary hypothesis is that hydrocortisone, compared to placebo, will decrease the the incidence of new or progressive organ dysfunction (primary outcome) and the proportion of subjects with poor outcomes, defined as death or severely impaired (\u226525% decrease from baseline) HRQL (secondary outcome). Subjects will be monitored daily while receiving care in the PICU for the occurrence of adverse events, including the following protocol specified events:hyperglycemia treated with any insulin; gastrointestinal hemorrhage treated with blood product transfusion or vasopressin or octreotide infusion; delirium requiring medical treatment; and hospital-acquired infection treated with new antimicrobials. Finally, the investigators will test the hypothesis that biomarker-based prognostic and predictive enrichment strategies can improve our ability to identify which children with septic shock are more likely to benefit from adjunctive hydrocortisone, and which may be harmed. This trial will have a significant impact on public health by providing the heretofore missing evidence to inform guidelines regarding therapy for septic shock in children.\n\nThe SHIPSS trial will enroll patients from PICUs in Canada, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Brazil, Vietnam, Pakistan, Japan, Malaysia, and Singapore. Health Canada approval is not required as hydrocortisone is approved for use in septic shock in children, and this trial meets the criteria of a Phase IV study. In the United States, this trial is considered a Phase III trial as hydrocortisone is not approved for use in pediatric septic shock.",
