The start of endocrine therapy will be at the discretion of the investigator; however, it will be encouraged to start after surgery/radiotherapy in patients without additional cytotoxic agents.\n\nAdjuvant pembrolizumab can be given until the completion of radiotherapy before randomization. Within the study the use of pembrolizumab in patients with TNBC who received pembrolizumab as neoadjuvant therapy is allowed as monotherapy in the TPC arm, according to the approval of pembrolizumab in this setting.",
    "detailed_description": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) allows monitoring of tumor response to treatment and a pathological complete response (pCR) is associated with superior survival. This association is strongest in the most aggressive subtype, i.e. in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Patients with TNBC not achieving a pCR have a 5-year event free survival rate of about 50%. The association between pCR and prognosis is less pronounced in HR-positive/HER2-negative patients. However, the CPS+EG scoring system for prognosis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, taking into account clinical stage, post treatment pathological stage, estrogen receptor status and grade, leads to an improved estimate of prognosis allowing to select patients at high risk of relapse for post-neoadjuvant therapy. Patients with TNBC not achieving a pCR as well as those with HR-positive/HER2-negative tumors and a CPS+EG score of 3 or 2/ypN+ are at high risk of relapse, warranting additional experimental therapies after NACT.\n\nThere is proof of concept, that post-neoadjuvant therapy can significantly improve survival. First data was provided by the CREATE X trial, randomizing patients with residual tumor after neoadjuvant chemotherapy to either capecitabine or observation. CREATE X included HER2-negative patients and demonstrated a significant improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in the overall population, which was confined to the TNBC subgroup.\n\nRecently, the randomized post-neoadjuvant phase III KATHERINE study demonstrated an improved invasive disease-free survival in HER2-positive patients without pCR after trastuzumab +/- pertuzumab treated postoperatively with T-DM1, an antibody-drug-conjugate compared to trastuzumab.\n\nSacituzumab govitecan has demonstrated unprecedented activity in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic triple-negative and HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, even after prior immune-checkpoint inhibitors or CDK4/6 and mTOR inhibitors. Based on the results of the phase I/II study, sacituzumab govitecan was granted a breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic TNBC who have received at least two previous lines of treatment for metastatic disease. The efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan in advanced TNBC was confirmed in the phase III ASCENT trial. Based on this study, sacituzumab govitecan received regular approval. Additionally, the TROPiCS-02 study showed an improvement in progression-free survival and OS over single-agent chemotherapy and a manageable safety profile in patients with heavily pre-treated HR-positive/HER2-negative endocrine-resistant, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic BC.",

    "detailed_description": "About 15% of breast cancers lack both, expression of ER and PR receptors, and amplification/over-expression of HER2 receptors, and are thus described as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is known for poor prognosis, aggressive patterns of disease, and significant molecular heterogeneity. (Neo)adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is standard of care in all node-positive and in node-negative patients with a tumour size \\>5 mm according to current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. However, TNBC patients with lower stage disease do clearly have a better prognosis compared to more advanced stages. Patients with stage I-II node-negative disease have 3-5 year iDFS rates of 80-90% (with majority of relapses within the first three years) as shown in several trials. Our own results from the PlanB- and ADAPT-trials, and pooled analysis with SUCCESS C-trials show 3-year iDFS of 86-90% in node-negative TNBC with a tumour size \\< 3 cm. Although survival results appear much better in the lower vs. higher stages, there is a high clinical need in this most common group of TNBC patients in Western Europe and USA.\n\nIn the neoadjuvant setting, it has been shown that the prognosis of patients with TNBC is strongly dependent on their response to NACT: Patients achieving pathological complete response (pCR), or a near pCR (an excellent response after NACT (residual cancer burden (RCB) score 0-1), in some studies do have an excellent prognosis that is not significantly different from that observed in other breast cancer subtypes. However, patients with a less responsive disease (i.e., with RCB Score 2-3) suffer from a significantly worse prognosis compared to non-TNBC.\n\nChemotherapy in TNBC The optimal chemotherapy regimen for patients with TNBC remains to be identified. Standard anthracycline-taxane (A/T)-based NACT combinations render pCR rates between 25-50%. However, the survival impact of anthracyclines remains controversial due to conflicting results of different randomized trials. Adding carboplatin (carbo) to A/T-containing poly-NACT or use of dose-intensified poly-NACT significantly increases pCR-rates up to 49-60% in mostly stage II-III disease with conflicting survival results and higher toxicity. Hence, use of pragmatic taxane-carboplatin anthracycline-free combinations appears as an effective treatment option in TNBC instead of further treatment escalation. This probably is independent of the germline BRCA (gBRCA) status, due to its general chemo-predictive effect. Unfortunately, no prospective phase-III-data are available so far. However, indirect comparison between trials renders similar pCR rates in taxane-carboplatin based vs. A/T+/-carbo-based regimens in early TNBC.\n\nIn the ADAPT-TN neoadjuvant trial, the taxane-carbo arm (12-week nab-paclitaxel (nab-pac)+carbo) was well tolerable (only 10% SAE-rate), highly effective (pCR, ypT0/is/ypN0, of 46%) and superior to the gemcitabine (gem)-arm (nab-pac+gem, pCR of 29%). In this study, omission of further chemotherapy was allowed in patients with pCR after 12 weeks of therapy and was not associated with decreased survival after 3 years \\[5\\] and longer follow up.\n\nAlthough a standard chemotherapy as well as optimal therapy duration are still to be defined, several studies are showing a comparable efficacy for longer vs. shorter adjuvant treatments in TNBC \\[3\\], as well as a similar efficacy regarding pCR in HR-negative (in contrast to HR-positive) early breast cancer (eBC) \\[26\\]. Moreover 6 vs. 4 cycles of the same chemotherapy (AC or pac weekly) yielded a similar survival outcome in eBC despite of HR-status. No such comparison regarding treatment duration is available for modern antibody-drug conjugates like sacituzumab govitecan (SG).\n\nTherefore, an examination of shorter (12 weeks vs. 18 weeks) regimen as neoadjuvant treatment appears to be a very promising strategy at least in patients with lower risk disease or in elderly patients, who do not qualify for polychemotherapy treatments.\n\nIn the Keynote-522 trial combination of carboplatin/taxane-anthracycline NACT with the anti-PD1-antibody pembrolizumab (PEM) has been shown to be associated with a significantly higher pCR and clinically meaningful better EFS and a trend to better OS. Noteworthy only patients with more advanced stages IIa-III TNBC were included into the Keynote-522 trial. Although this effect was independent of clinically assessed nodal status, there is still some uncertainty on the optimal treatment in patients with clinical stage I.\n\nIn the metastatic setting, SG as a Trop-2-antibody-drug-conjugate has been shown to be highly efficacious in severely pre-treated patients (all with A/T pre-treated tumours, most of them carboplatin and 1/3 also anti-PD1 pre-treated) compared to chemotherapy of investigator\u00b4s choice. Treatment with SG was associated with significant longer median PFS (5.5 vs. 1.7 months) and longer median OS (12.1 vs. 6.7 months). Objective response was dramatically higher in the SG group vs. treatment by physician\u00b4s choice group (34.9 vs. 4.7%), in particular in the 2nd-3rd-line therapy (40% vs. 4%). Moreover, Tropics-02 trial has shown higher efficacy of SG vs. chemotherapy of investigator\u00b4s choice in patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.\n\nIn the neoadjuvant setting, recently presented results from the NeoSTAR trial show a promising pCR-rate of 30% and RCB 0-1-rate of 36% in TNBC patients with mostly stage II-III-disease (about 80%) after only 4 cycles of SG.\n\nThe following clinical questions are of highest medical need\n\n1. Can 12-18 weeks neoadjuvant treatment with SG alone or in combination with PEM be associated with comparable pCR-rates (but more favourable safety profile) as shown for polychemotherapy in TNBC patients at lower relapse risk in historical controls?\n2. Can SG-based therapy, as the most promising agent in patients with chemo-resistant disease, be associated with a such better prognosis (measured by 3-year-iDFS) compared to historical controls, which would make a randomized phase III-trial obsolete?",

    "brief_summary": "LAmB-FAST is a factorial randomized controlled trial simultaneously testing two interventions in one trial. LAmB-FAST seeks to inform treatment guidelines on the induction and maintenance therapy of HIV-associated talaromycosis (formerly called penicilliosis) and will answer the following three questions:\n\n1. Is induction therapy using a single 10 mg\\\\/kg dose of liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) is more effective than 14 days of the conventional deoxycholate amphotericin B (DAmB)?\n2. Is adding flucytosine (5FC) to amphotericin B more effective than amphotericin B alone?\n3. Is HIV viral load guided stopping of itraconazole maintenance therapy as effective as the current CD4 guided strategy in the prevention of talaromycosis relapse?",
    "detailed_description": "Talaromycosis (formerly known as penicilliosis) is caused by the dimorphic fungus Talaromyces marneffei (Tm) endemic in Southeast Asia where it is a leading the cause of death among people with advanced HIV disease (AHD, CD4 count \\<200 cells/mm3 and/or WHO disease stage III or IV). Despite the mortality on treatment as high as 30%, current treatment options are limited to just two drugs: amphotericin B deoxycholate (DAmB) - which has substantial toxicity, and itraconazole - which has poor bioavailability.\n\nAs a roadmap to identify safer and more effective antifungal strategies, LAmB-FAST applies major advances made in HIV-associated mycoses to accelerate treatment for HIV-associated talaromycosis. First, clinical trials in cryptococcosis showed that shorter courses (5 to 7 days) of DAmB was as effective and less toxic than the standard 14-day course of DAmB. The recent AMBITION cryptococcal meningitis showed that a single 10 mg/kg dose of liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) was as effective as 7 to 14 days of DAmB but had 30% less toxicity, leading to rapid endorsement by the WHO as the first-line therapy for cryptococcal meningitis in 2022. A single LAmB induction therapy strategy has also been demonstrated in a phase II HIV-associated histoplasmosis trial which showed that a single 10 mg/kg dose of LAmB had similar mortality compared to 2 doses or 14 daily doses of LAmB. Second, the addition of flucytosine (5FC) to DAmB has been shown to improves fungal clearance in the cerebrospinnal fluid and survival of patients with cryptococcal meningitis. These advances in other HIV-associated mycoses lead us to hypothesize that 1) a single 10mg/kg dose of LAmB will be superior to 14 days of DAmB and 2) the addition of 5FC will be superior to DAmB or LAmB alone in the induction therapy of talaromyosis.\n\nLAmB-FAST will test three related but independent specific aims: AIM 1: To determine if a single 10mg/kg dose of LAmB is superior to 14 days of DAmB in Tm complication-free survival. AIM 2:\n\nTo determine if combination therapy with 5FC is superior to DAmB or LAmB alone in Tm complication-free survival.\n\nThe primary outcome (for both AIM 1 and AIM 2) is hazard of a composite of death, Tm complications, and adverse events (AEs) grade 3 or higher.\n\nThe secondary outcomes include:\n\n1. All-cause mortality;\n2. Fungal clearance rate over first 14 days;\n3. A novel 4-scale hierarchical outcome of i. Mortality, ii. Tm complications, iii. AEs grade 3, iv. Quality of life scores;\n4. Rates of Tm DNA and Tm antigen decline over first 12 weeks.\n\nAIM 3 will leverage access to a well-characterized and treated talaromycosis cohort in AIM 1 and AIM 2 to conduct a follow-on nested randomized controlled sub-study testing whether a HIV viral load guided strategy of stopping itraconazole chemoprophylaxis (STOP SHORT) is non-inferior to the current CD4 guided strategy in the prevention of talaromycosis relapse and death.",

Those in the intervention group will receive 6 months of digital coaching up front followed by 6 months of ongoing monitoring via patient reported and clinical outcomes, as well as wearable data.

The study aims to explore if and how digital health coaching may be used to enhance outcomes for individuals following completion of primary cancer therapy.",
    "detailed_description": "Background: There are an estimated 16.9 million cancer survivors in the United States, accounting for approximately 5% of the entire US population, and this number is anticipated to increase by 31% over the next 10 years to include 22.2 million individuals.1 Due to advances in therapy individuals with cancer are experiencing increased overall survival that is often accompanied by the management of cancer as a chronic condition.2 As such many individuals require maintenance therapies that extend for months or years beyond the completion of primary therapy with surgery, radiation, and/or pharmacologic therapies. Chronic management of cancer care may include both long-term maintenance therapy as well as the management of treatment-related sequelae, the majority of which occurs beyond the clinical setting. Supportive care needs include symptom support, general wellness, and a focus on the importance of adherence to treatment and follow-up, all of which may influence quality and quantity of life. Accordingly, there is a critical and growing need for comprehensive, accessible platforms to support survivor self-management of symptoms and general wellness (including physical, functional, and psychosocial well-being and healthcare adherence). There is furthermore a critical knowledge gap on the correlation between individual symptoms and wellness on novel biomarkers, specifically intestinal (gut) microbiome. Gut microbiome regulates critical physiological processes-digestion, mood, and overall immune health, but to date studies have focused on dysbiosis during cancer treatment. The investigators seek to explore dynamics of gut microbiota after cancer treatment and understand how health behavioral changes prompted by health coaching to modulate symptoms and physical/ psychosocial well-being may also positively influence the restoration of gut flora.\n\nAims: The objective of this randomized, wait-list control study is to assess the effect of a 6-month digital health coaching program in cancer survivors within 1 year of primary treatment and longitudinally measure its impact on multifaceted health outcomes. The investigators aim to: 1) Primarily, assess the feasibility, acceptability, and effect of digital health coaching on participants' health self-efficacy; 2) Secondarily, characterize associations between participant symptoms, physical/psychosocial well-being, and health self-management and gut microbiota changes; and 3) Explore patient-generated health data outcomes among participants (patient-reported \\[PROs\\] and wearable biometrics outcomes).\n\nMethods: The proposed study will utilize a randomized-wait list control design to enroll up to 625 individuals with diverse tumor types who have completed primary treatment and are within 1 year of diagnosis. Each of up to 8 collaborating sites will enroll up to 100 participants. Participants will be enrolled in a 6-month digital health coaching program that combines person-to-person calls once weekly, accompanied by up to 4 digital nudges of evidence-based content via text, email and/or mobile application, based on the participant's preference. Content will focus on key topics designed to optimize survivorship outcomes, including management of late and long-term effects of therapy, diet and exercise, fatigue, financial toxicity, and other associated symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, depression), medication adherence, surveillance, and managing anxiety and fear of cancer recurrence. The program emphasizes targeting modifiable behaviors that can improve quality of life and health outcomes, including progression-free and overall survival. Those randomized to the intervention group will receive the 6-month coaching intervention up front followed by 6 months of on-going clinical, patient reported, activity, and microbiome data collection. Those randomized to the control will receive 6-months of clinical, patient reported, activity, and microbiome data collection, after which they will be randomized to the digital health coaching intervention.\n\nOutcome Measures: All participants will be followed for 12-months during which time they will be provided with Fitbit devices to track engagement in physical activity. Microbiome samples will be collected at enrollment and 6 months to explore biomarkers of inflammation, which will be analyzed to examine associations between microbiota signatures and engagement in physical activity and PROs. Genomic bacterial DNA will be extracted and analyzed for any taxonomic changes in the microbiota diversity and composition with 16s rRNA sequencing. Microbiome analysis will be conducted in partnership with The National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR). PROs will be collected at baseline and months 3, 6, 9, and 12 to track progress during and following the program and to provide insights into the experience of quality of life, symptom burden, mental health, cognitive function, sleep quality, sexual health, and financial toxicity.\n\nRationale: This program seeks to address survivors' total well-being, including co-morbid conditions, psychosocial wellness, and healthy lifestyle behaviors, to enhance outcomes for individuals who have completed primary therapy for a cancer diagnosis. The approach is innovative in exploring how digital health coaching may be used to support the holistic needs of cancer survivors beyond the clinical care setting. The robust collection of patient-reported, wearable, biomarker, and clinical data, as well as qualitative data related to patient priorities, concerns and challenges in the context of Health Coaching, will allow for triangulation of data to comprehensively inform the experience of individuals following primary therapy as they manage their health in the community setting.",

By using a standard smartphone camera, shining light on TruTag-coated medications automatically identifies them to an onboard smartphone app which then indirectly records the adherence event. This study evaluates the real-world usability and feasibility of operating this system among people living with HIV (PLWH).",

A companion smartphone app will record scans as an indirect measure of adherence. Included in the app will be a reminder system to nudge individuals to take their Biktarvy and a two-way text portal that allows participants to communicate securely with the study team. Participants will be screened and enrolled, and will then attend three monthly study visits, where the study team will assess adherence, dispense TruTag Biktarvy, and understand how the TruTag system is operated in the real world. At the final 90-day study visit, the study team will conduct a qualitative interview to explore acceptability and future design iterations of the TruTag system.",

    "brief_summary": "In China, free first-line ART regimens typically consist of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). As of the end of 2022, approximately 1.135 million individuals were receiving ART, achieving a coverage rate of 92.8%, largely due to participation in free treatment programs. However, around 36,000 patients have discontinued treatment, primarily due to side effects associated with Efavirenz (EFV), a common NNRTI. The challenges posed by side effects and resistance profiles of existing NNRTIs highlight the need for effective re-initiation of ART to improve overall treatment coverage. INSTIs, particularly B/F/TAF (Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide), demonstrates effective viral suppression and a higher barrier to resistance than NNRTIs. B/F/TAF has shown efficacy in patients with resistance mutations, making it a strong candidate for same-day ART re-initiation, especially in resource-limited areas where genotypic resistance testing may be unavailable. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of rapidly restarting B/F/TAF in patients with treatment interruptions from previous NNRTI regimens.",

Patients will be actively followed for 6 months including HCV PCR tests and then for up for 5 years to look for evidence of HCV infection and any liver or extra-hepatic complications, as well as standard post-transplant complications. This will be a single center pilot study.",
    "detailed_description": "The success of lung transplantation (LTx) is significantly hindered by the lack of sufficient number of available donors. Many potential donor lungs cannot be utilized in clinical transplantation because donors have chronic viral infections such as hepatitis C (HCV) infection. This study will test the possibility of safely transplanting lungs from HCV positive donors. Donor lungs will be subjected to Normothermic Ex vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP) for 6 hours for organ assessment and reduction of viral load prior to transplantation. After transplantation, recipients will be carefully monitored for HCV infection and if infection occurs, they will be promptly treated with highly effective antiviral therapy using newly approved DAAs. The aim of the study is to show that transplantation of lungs from HCV positive donors is safe in the era of DAAs. The hypothesis is that the rate of HCV transmission to recipients will be lower than previously described due to EVLP pre-treatment and any HCV transmission that does occur will be readily treatable and curable. If successful, the knowledge from this study can have a large impact to patients with end stage organ diseases by providing a large novel source of donors for lung and potentially other organ transplantations.",

    "brief_summary": "The #aware.hiv Europe study is a real-world, multicenter, stepped-wedge cluster randomized, effectiveness-implementation trial designed to evaluate whether the introduction of dedicated HIV teams in hospitals can improve HIV testing rates among patients presenting with HIV indicator conditions across ten European countries.\n\nStudy Design:\n\nThe study employs a stepped-wedge design, whereby clusters of hospitals transition sequentially from a control phase (routine care) to an intervention phase. All patient data are collected retrospectively from routine care, while prospective data are gathered at the healthcare professional level. The project spans four years and involves hospitals from the Netherlands, Belgium, United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Romania, Poland, and Ukraine. This design allows for comparison of HIV testing rates and related outcomes before and after the implementation across different settings and time points.\n\nIntervention:\n\nThe core intervention involves the establishment of hospital-based HIV teams. Each team is led by an HIV specialist and supported by nurses and data collectors. Their responsibilities include:\n\nIdentification and Surveillance: Screening routine electronic health records for HIV indicator conditions using predefined ICD-10 codes and verifying cases that warrant HIV testing.\n\nAudit \\& Feedback: Providing targeted recommendations to treating physicians when an HIV test is indicated but has not been performed, thereby prompting action.\n\nEducation \\& Training: Delivering training sessions to healthcare professionals to improve their knowledge and attitudes towards HIV testing, prevention, and care.\n\nEnabling Environment: Implementing digital solutions and other support mechanisms to streamline testing processes, reduce stigma, and enhance overall guideline adherence.\n\nLinkage to prevention: Improving linkage to the locally available preventive services.\n\nThe intervention is intended to integrate seamlessly into routine hospital care, thereby reinforcing existing guidelines while addressing the current diagnostic testing gap.\n\nEndpoints and Outcome Measures:\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\nThe change in HIV testing rate among patients diagnosed with HIV indicator conditions before and after the implementation of HIV teams.\n\nKey Secondary Endpoints:\n\nThe change in the incidence of new HIV diagnoses among patients with HIV indicator conditions.\n\nVariations in HIV testing rates across different countries, medical specialties, and types of indicator conditions, as well as over time.\n\nAssessment of the cascade of HIV diagnosis, including the proportion of patients identified with an indicator condition, the offer and acceptance of HIV testing, and documented reasons for non-testing.\n\nEvaluation of the cascade of HIV care and prevention, including linkage to HIV care, achievement of viral suppression, and referral and uptake of preventive services.\n\nChanges in healthcare professionals' knowledge, attitudes, and levels of stigma towards HIV.\n\nImplementation outcomes such as fidelity of HIV team activities, resource utilization, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of the intervention.\n\nAnalysis of contextual factors, barriers, and facilitators impacting the implementation process, using established frameworks like CFIR and RE-AIM.\n\nImpact:\n\nBy introducing HIV teams and systematically monitoring their effect on HIV testing practices, the study aims to enhance early HIV diagnosis and improve patient outcomes. The findings will contribute to evidence-based guidelines and may promote the adoption of similar interventions across European healthcare settings, ultimately reducing HIV-associated morbidity, mortality, and transmission rates.\n\nThis project not only addresses a critical diagnostic gap in HIV care but also provides valuable insights into the effective implementation of complex interventions in routine clinical practice.",

    "detailed_description": "The overarching goal of the Kentucky Viral Hepatitis Treatment Project (KeY Treat) is to increase access to treatment for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in a rural Appalachian community in the midst of the opioid/HCV syndemic. This study seeks to examine whether removing barriers associated with accessing direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for the treatment of HCV (high out-of-pocket costs, insurance restrictions requiring a specialist, abstinence, and significant liver damage) will significantly reduce the burden of HCV in Perry County, Kentucky. The proposed study is made possible by a significant drug donation from Gilead Sciences for sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, a 12-week, once per day, pan-genotypic DAA. KeY Treat proposes a multi-pronged approach to treating HCV using a mid-level provider model. In addition to DAA treatment, participants will be offered access to subsidized medication-assisted treatment, syringe services, and case management. Existing resources in the target community (public health, jail, hospital) will be leveraged, as well as ongoing projects dedicated to increasing access to HCV care in affected communities (ECHO, FOCUS) to answer whether removing the major barriers to HCV treatment affect access, and what barriers remain. All RNA-positive residents of Perry County, Kentucky will be eligible/recruited for study participation (N\u2248900), and the following specific aims will be addressed: 1) determination of HCV treatment uptake among rural residents with chronic HCV; 2) examination of the predictors of treatment completion among those enrolled in KeY Treat; 3) examination of the characteristics of participants achieving sustained virologic response (SVR, or cure); 4) establishment of long-term re-infection rates among those achieving SVR; 5) examination of 5-year reductions in incidence and prevalence of HCV in the intervention community compared with a control county in rural Kentucky; and 6) evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of KeY Treat using mathematical modeling. The proposed research has tremendous potential to impact public health in the rural United States. The majority of counties identified in CDC's recent HCV/HIV hotspot analysis were rural, and there is a real need to improve access to DAAs in order to prevent further HCV transmission, reduce the burden of advanced liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma in generations to come. Data from KeY Treat will inform policies around Medicaid/insurance restrictions for DAAs, and will deliver a much needed blueprint for the provision of HCV treatment in resource-deprived rural areas.",

    "detailed_description": "The trial will enroll competitively up to 21 patients per cohort. The study will enroll the first 12 patients within the cohort and monitor for response. If no confirmed response is documented the cohort will be closed. If there is one or more confirmed responses reported that cohort will be expanded up to the expected 21 patients. All patients, male or female, \u2265 18 years, with ECOG PS 0-1. Cohort 1 will include patients with advanced radioactive-iodine refractory DTC who progressed to previous TKIs (including but not limited to lenvatinib, sunitinib or cabozantinib) and cohort 2 will include patients with advanced or metastatic ATC who may be on first-line or progressed to a previous systemic treatment. Patients will have not received previously chemotherapy, biologics, investigational agents, and/or antitumor treatment with immunotherapy that are not completed 2 weeks before first dose of study treatment (See Section 6 for further detail on eligibility).\n\nAll enrolled patients will receive sacituzumab govitecan (10 mg/kg intravenously) on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. Patients will be treated until progression, death, study withdrawal, or unacceptable toxicity. Sacituzumab govitecan is administered intravenously as a slow infusion as described below.\n\nDosing is based on the patient's body weight on Day 1 of each cycle (or at each dosing day if change in body weight is \\>10% or if required by institutional policy). Sacituzumab govitecan at 10 mg/kg will be the highest assigned dose. Dose reductions and delays will be allowed.\n\nAll patients will undergo periodic tumor assessments by CT or MRI scan every 12 weeks \u00b1 14 days (3 months), and blood monitoring of tumor markers (i.e. thyroglobulin if applicable) every 12 weeks \u00b1 3 days (3 months) from the start of study treatment until progression or patient withdrawal.",

    "detailed_description": "Historically, the prognosis for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) brain metastases (BM) was poor, but this paradigm is slowly shifting as current data with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) based regimen show that a subgroup of patients with BM can achieve long-term survival. For patients with disease progression in the brain after platinum-doublet chemotherapy and ICI, no good systemic treatment options exist and due to local treatments, systemic therapy is often delayed. Of note, most of these patients also have extra-cranial disease progression which needs to be treated. The current standard of care post chemo-ICI progression is docetaxel, with dismal outcomes. The same holds true for patients with NSCLC with an actionable genomic alteration. Upon exhaustion of targeted therapies and platinum-doublet chemotherapy with or without ICI, the standard of care is docetaxel with the same dismal outcomes. Therefore, new systemic therapies that are active systemically as well as intracranially are needed in this population. Antibody-drug-conjugates (ADC) are promising new drugs and several have entered testing in randomized phase III trials. In the majority of the trials evaluating ADCs, patients with untreated BM were excluded. Importantly, Sacituzumab Govitecan (SG), a TROP2-ADC, achieves therapeutic concentrations of SN-38, the active payload of SG, in the CNS. SG is evaluated versus docetaxel in the ongoing EVOKE-1 trial (NCT05089734) but patients with untreated BM are excluded. Preclinically, SG combined with bevacizumab, but not with cetuximab, significantly improved survival over SG alone. Bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy results in an impressive intracranial ORR of 61%. Of note, a possible pseudo response (a marked decrease in contrast enhancement and oedema on MR imaging that often occurs after the initiation of bevacizumab therapy, attributed to normalization of the blood-brain barrier), was not taken into account. Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between bevacizumab and SG are not expected given the distinct proteolytic catabolism responsible for degradation of each monoclonal antibody (moiety). In addition, SN-38 is metabolized by UGT1A1, which is not affected by bevacizumab. Based on the data above, it is of interest to also evaluate SG combined with bevacizumab in patients with BM from NSCLC. This will be evaluated in patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with disease progression on chemotherapy and immunotherapy.",

    "detailed_description": "This is a single arm feasibility study with 3-month follow-up.\n\nAfrican American cisgender women in the South are disproportionately affected by HIV infection yet have inequitable access to Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP). To promote equitable use of PrEP by women living in low-income housing in Durham, North Carolina (NC) (the vast majority of whom are African American), the investigators aim to conduct a formative study to develop and refine a scalable PrEP delivery approach which addresses the two key barriers of access and awareness. In this pilot study the investigators will test the feasibility of the delivery mode and features of a community outreach PrEP mobile unit and provide Peer Networkers and PrEP messaging tailored to women living in public housing.\n\nThe objectives of the study are to evaluate the feasibility of delivering the IFE4Her intervention in public housing communities. The IFE4Her intervention consists of: 1) a communication campaign including enhanced PrEP messaging and peer networker communication; 2) A mobile PrEP clinic. Assessments will include a satisfaction survey for participants receiving services in the mobile clinic, service records, follow-up in-depth interviews at 3 months, and chart review at 6 months to assess 3-month outcomes.\n\nStudy Duration Each participant's study duration will depend upon the study activities they elect to engage in. Each subject's participation in the anonymous survey will last approximately 10 minutes immediately after their medical visit. Each subject's participation in the follow-up interview which will take place approximately 3 months after the mobile medical visit and will last approximately one hour. Medical record data (specifically follow up visit participation and prescription completion as described in detail below) will be collected after the 3 month visit but up to 6 months after participation in the initial medical visit.\n\nThe entire pilot study is expected to last up to 2 years.\n\nIntervention Description\n\n1. Communication campaign\n\n   1. Communication Materials - PrEP Posters and Infographics that provide information about PrEP for women, and materials on complementary health services including hypertension screening, blood glucose screening, and HIV-testing.\n   2. Peer Networker Information Dissemination - Trained Peer Networkers will disseminate information about PrEP, complementary women's health issues, and the mobile medical unit through distribution of communication materials and in-person communication.\n2. Mobile Medical Unit All study-related clinical services will occur in a safe, confidential, and private space in a mobile medical unit. The mobile medical unit will offer the following services: blood pressure checks, blood glucose monitoring, rapid HIV antibody testing, and for those interested, PrEP consultation and clinical assessment and care as indicated. These services will be provided by university health care system clinicians. Participants receiving PrEP will be receive follow-up care in the university health care system.\n\nOf note, no study drug is being tested. The PrEP medication emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (trade name Truvada\u00ae) that providers will write prescriptions for is the only medication currently approved for women. It is very well tolerated and taken once daily. Truvada prescriptions will be provided in accordance with standard clinical care. These decisions are not protocol/study-driven and not an intervention being studied by the trial.",

The FDA has not approved Sacituzumab Govitecan for metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) (bladder cancer) but it has been approved for other uses. The FDA has approved Sacituzumab Govitecan to treat a type of breast cancer at this time. Sacituzumab Govitecan has appeared promising in patients with bladder cancer that has spread and works by a different mechanism than Enfortumab Vedotin. Therefore, the researchers believe that combining these 2 drugs may control the cancer better than each drug does on its own.\n\nThis will be done through testing different combinations and checking for serious side effects; if there are no serious side effects a different dose combination will be explored. Once the best combination has been determined, the study will look to see how effective (how well the drug works) it is in slowing down the growth of metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) progressing on platinum-based chemotherapy and PD1/L1 inhibitors and define the most appropriate level of the drugs to use for further studies.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment, and safety follow-up visits, in addition to general health status follow-up after study treatment.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment for as long as they do not have serious side effects and their disease does not get worse. However, the duration may vary depending on how long the treatment works to control the cancer and how someone's body tolerates the side effects.\n\nImmunomedics, a pharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by providing funding for the research study, tests required for research purposes only, and the study drug Sacituzumab Govitecan.\n\nIt is expected that up to 24 people will take part in this research study.",

For patients who suffer a relapse after receiving therapy with standard of care multimodality treatment, there are no known curative options. Glypican 2 (GPC2) is highly expressed on the plasma membrane of most high-risk neuroblastomas, is further enriched in the tumor stem cell compartment, but is not expressed at significant levels on normal tissues, making it an ideal target for immune directed therapies. To therapeutically leverage GPC2's differential expression, a GPC2-directed CAR T cell therapy that potently inhibits the growth of neuroblastoma patient-derived xenografts has been developed. This investigation will be a single institution, open-label first in human, dose escalation and expansion study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and manufacturing feasibility of GPC2 CAR T cells.",

During the Enrollment Visit (Visit 2), participants will complete a baseline quantitative assessment (e.g., sociodemographics, sexual history, attitudes about technology), receive training on the operation of the DPS and Beiwe, and will ingest their first digital pill dose under observation by study staff. Participants will be instructed to take one PrEP pill once daily while using the DPS and Beiwe app for 60 days. Participants will return for a study visit at the end of month one (Visit 3) for a refill of digital pills. Following a 24-hour period which no PrEP ingestion is detected by the DPS, participants will receive a brief online substance use and sexual risk survey, which will inform specific contexts of nonadherence. At the Month 1 Visit (Visit 3) and Month 2 Visit (Visit 4), timeline followback discussions will be conducted to better understand the context of any PrEP nonadherence events detected by the DPS, and phenotypic data collected by the Beiwe app, during the prior 30 days. At the Month 2 (Visit 4), the investigators will administer a blood draw for dried blood spot (DBS) testing to measure participants' PrEP adherence and compare it against adherence detected by the DPS. To gain insight into user experiences operating the DPS and Beiwe app as part of the study, the investigators will conduct the semi-structured qualitative exit interviews with participants at Month 2 (Visit 4).",

Participants will be screened between 12+0 and 29+6 weeks of gestation confirmed by ultrasound. HCV RNA level to confirm the patient has active infection will be obtained. Laboratory evaluation of liver function will be obtained, to evaluate for renal insufficiency, decompensated cirrhosis and baseline elevations of lipase and creatine kinase. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigen will be performed to look for evidence of active HBV infection. Medical history and demographic information will also be collected at screening. If the inclusion and exclusion criteria are met, the patient will be enrolled into the study between 20+0 and 30+0 weeks' gestation and initiate a 12-week course of a fixed-dose combination tablet of sofosbuvir 400 mg and velpatasvir 100 mg. Maternal participants will take one SOF/VEL tablet once daily for 12 weeks (84 days). The study will be completed in 8 or 9 visits (6 maternal visits and 3 infant visits). The primary endpoints are 1) maternal HCV RNA PCR 12 weeks after completion of SOF/VEL treatment (HCV RNA PCR below the lower limit of quantification will be considered evidence of SVR12) and 2) preterm delivery (spontaneous and iatrogenic) prior to 37 weeks' gestation. The secondary endpoints are 1) Maternal safety defined as maternal adverse events and pregnancy and delivery outcomes (stillbirth or intrauterine fetal demise, intrapartum hemorrhage, postpartum hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, intrauterine growth restriction, cholestasis of pregnancy, severe maternal morbidity (defined by CDC), maternal admission to the intensive care unit, maternal death), 2) composite neonatal/Infant safety endpoints defined as severe neonatal morbidity with admission to neonatal intensive care unit and stratified by perinatal preterm (\\<37 weeks) (including fetal or neonatal death, severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (grade 3) intraventricular hemorrhage grades III-IV, necrotizing enterocolitis (proven - Bell Stage 2A or greater), periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity stage III-V, or proven sepsis (early or late)) and perinatal term (\\>= 37 weeks) (including fetal or neonatal death, respiratory support , Apgar score \u2264 3 at 5 minutes, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, seizure, infection (sepsis or pneumonia), birth trauma, meconium aspiration syndrome, intracranial or subgaleal hemorrhage, or hypotension requiring vasopressor support).

The HIV-related death rate in the US South is high, but engagement with quality HIV prevention services and care is low. Although only 38% of the US population lives in the South, the region accounts for 51% of new HIV infections. Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) account for 60% of new infections among African Americans in the South. Black MSM are one of the most vulnerable groups to HIV transmission in the US. HIV testing and PrEP uptake in Black MSM, however, remain low (10%) due to multiple factors including stigma, sexual-orientation based discrimination and low PrEP awareness among Black MSM. Innovative strategies that motivate and provide guidance for PrEP among Black MSM in the US South are therefore urgently needed. Chatbot technology should be tested and implemented to help improve PrEP awareness and uptake in the US South. In this project, the investigators aim to develop and pilot test to assess the acceptability and feasibility of a chatbot for PrEP awareness and uptake relative to treatment as usual (control).",

    "detailed_description": "Despite being preventable, cancer of the cervix is a leading cause of cancer death in Kenya and other low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Cervical cancer can be prevented if early changes in the cervix, called cervical precancer, are detected through screening, and adequately treated. Cervical precancer treatment includes a surgical procedure called Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP), which removed the involved area of the cervix.\n\nIn countries like Kenya, this LEEP procedure is only available in referral hospitals which have trained consultants, and hence is difficult to access for most women who live in rural areas and away from tertiary facilities. Additionally, the LEEP procedure also increases the chance of a woman not being able to carry a pregnancy to full term, because the cervix is shorter after the procedure. For these reasons, alternative treatments, including self-administered treatments such as Artesunate are being investigated as alternative cervical precancer treatment that can be self-administered.",

    "brief_summary": "A randomised controlled trial of the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of Cayston Cayston (Aztreonam Lysine) compared to placebo in participants with bronchiectasis.\n\nBronchiectasis not due to cystic fibrosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterised by cough, sputum production and frequent respiratory tract infections. There are currently no licensed therapies for bronchiectasis approved by regulators in the United States or Europe. The disease has a high morbidity, particularly in the presence of chronic P. aeruginosa and other chronic Gram-negative infections.\n\nThis trial will test the hypothesis that 12 months treatment with Aztreonam lysine for inhalation will be safe and well tolerated, and will result in a significant increase in the time to first pulmonary exacerbation in participants with bronchiectasis and a history of frequent exacerbations.\n\nThis is a multi-centre randomised double-blind placebo controlled parallel group trial with four treatment arms. It will enroll 100 bronchiectasis patients with a history of at least 3 exacerbations in the previous year and the presence of chronic Gram-negative infection in sputum at screening. Patients will be treated following a one month on, one month off treatment regimen for 12 months.\n\nThe primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Aztrenam lysine in these patients by recording adverse events and trial treatment withdrawals.",
    "detailed_description": "Chronic neutrophilic inflammation is a feature of bronchiectasis and the levels of neutrophilic inflammation predict the risk of future exacerbations. Neutrophilic inflammation is highest in participants with P. aeruginosa and other Gram negative pathogens and inflammation can be suppressed by inhaled antibiotic treatment . There is therefore a strong rationale for the effectiveness of inhaled antibiotic treatment in bronchiectasis.\n\nStudies of inhaled antibiotics in bronchiectasis have given mixed results to date. Several open label studies in the late 1980's, testing nebulised \u03b2-lactams, demonstrated reduced sputum purulence, sputum volume and improvements in inflammatory markers. In an early phase II double-blind placebo-controlled trial by Barker et al. nebulised tobramycin significantly reduced the primary outcome of P. aeruginosa bacterial load but was poorly tolerated by some participants. Subsequently a single centre randomised controlled trial of nebulised gentamicin for 12 months reported significant benefits but was limited by open label design and small sample size. Haworth et al recruited 144 participants with chronic P. aeruginosa infection and randomized participants to nebulised colistin or placebo. The trial narrowly failed to meet its primary end-point (colistin group 165 days versus placebo 111 days; p=0.11). In the secondary end-points, a large improvement in quality of life using the SGRQ was noted (mean difference -10.5 points; p=0.006).\n\nAztreonam is an inhaled antibiotic licensed for treatment in cystic fibrosis. Two recent phase III trials in bronchiectasis randomised 266 (AIR-BX1) and 274 (AIR-BX2) participants to Aztreonam 75mg three times daily or placebo over the course of two 28-day treatment cycles (with 28 days off treatment between cycles). The primary outcome was the newly developed Quality of Life Bronchiectasis (QoL-B) questionnaire. Unfortunately the trial failed to meet its primary end-point, with a significant change observed in the QOL-B respiratory symptom score in AIR-BX2 but not in AIR-BX1. Treatment related adverse effects were also increased in the Aztreonam treated participants.\n\nLikely explanations for the difficulties encountered in this previous trial include that the trial population was quite heterogeneous, with many participants having no history of exacerbations and appearing to have relatively mild disease. Many patients did not have a history exacerbations in this trial whereas the ERS bronchiectasis guidelines suggest limiting inhaled antibiotic use to patients with a history of 3 or more exacerbations per year. The characteristics of the included participants included high rates of pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease and COPD. Nadig and Flume compared the characteristics of included participants in this trial to their own population of participants with severe bronchiectasis treated with inhaled antibiotics and identified little correlation, suggesting that the trials included a skewed population that was not representative of real-life clinical practice (Nadig and Flume AJRCCM 2016).\n\nIn addition, no dose finding studies were performed in bronchiectasis. The dose of 75mg three times daily was chosen based on efficacy and safety in cystic fibrosis. The rates of adverse events appear to be higher in bronchiectasis suggesting that doses selected for CF may not be fully appropriate for participants with non-CF bronchiectasis. Whether lower doses may have efficacy and better safety has not been investigated.\n\nThere is a need to determine the safety and efficacy of Aztreonam lysine in participants with bronchiectasis and a history of frequent exacerbations.\n\nThe researchers hypothesise that Aztreonam lysine will be safe and well tolerated and will reduce the frequency of exacerbations in participants with bronchiectasis and a history of frequent exacerbations. This trial will test two different doses of Aztreonam lysine compared to placebo. The efficacy and safety of Aztreonam is supported by the evidence for Aztreonam in cystic fibrosis where Aztreonam prolonged the time to first exacerbation by 21 days compared to placebo and improved quality of life. The AIR-BX studies evaluated Aztreonam for inhalation for only 2 treatment cycles. They showed suppression of chronic Gram-negative airway bacterial load but were not designed to evaluate the impact of Aztreonam on the frequency or time to first exacerbation. No attempt to identify the optimal dose was made. The incidence of treatment related adverse effects was increased in AIR-BX1 but was more balanced in AIR-BX2, a trial conducted primarily in European bronchiectasis participants. The reason for this imbalance is unknown.\n\nThe researchers hypothesise that 12 months treatment with Aztreonam lysine for inhalation will be safe and well tolerated, and will result in a significant increase in the time to first pulmonary exacerbation in participants with bronchiectasis and a history of frequent exacerbations.",

    "brief_summary": "Globally, women accounted for more than half of people living with HIV (53%) in 2022. In France, 54% of new infections were heterosexual in 2022, 71% of whom were born abroad, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa (74%). Among women, 80% of new cases were born abroad, of which at least 30% contracted HIV after arriving in France, often in connection with social vulnerability as shown by the French study Parcours. In the Paris region, 1,243 new cases among women were registered between 2018 and 2021 (about 300 per year).\n\nUnstable housing, experiences of violence, lack of residence permits and sex trade increase the risk of HIV among women. Positive test migrants often report a higher frequency of forced sex. These women also face high risks of other STIs, unwanted pregnancies, violence and mental health problems.\n\nPrEP is a means of preventing HIV infection by taking an antiretroviral drug, which has been fully proven to be effective in the form of tablets or injections. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is part of a comprehensive prevention service pathway.\n\nDespite the free availability of PrEP in France from 2027 and essential monitoring tools for men and women at high risk, women at risk remain largely uncovered by prevention initiatives, making them a \"hidden population\" under-studied. In France, recent data show that only 5% of PrEP users are women, compared to 95% of men, mainly men who have sex with men (MSM).\n\nSeveral factors hinder access to PrEP, including limited knowledge of available services, misperceptions of risk (because women rarely initiate sexual intercourse), fear of stigma and lack of resources. In addition, France lacks comprehensive programs that integrate health care, sexual health, mental health and social and legal support for these women.\n\nThe PrEVE study aims to demonstrate that the involvement of community-based organizations can play an important role in engaging and retaining women in vulnerable situations in a sexual health program. This program provides information, screening and prophylaxis to meet the specific sexual health needs of vulnerable women.",
    "detailed_description": "Overall, HIV prevalence among girls and women is higher than that of boys and men since the 2000s. For example, UNAIDS data in 2022 shows that 53% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) are girls and women, or about 21 million people, and 46% of new HIV infections are girls and women.\n\nThis difference is due to a higher risk of HIV infection among girls and young women, especially in Africa : UNAIDS pointed out in 2018 that HIV infections among girls and young women aged 15-19 are about twice as high globally as among boys and young men of the same age.\n\nIn France, women represent about 35% of PLHIV. Data from the French national hospital cohort of HIV infection show that 1,243 women were newly treated between 2018 and 2021 in Ile de France (IDF), which is about 300 new women taken care of per year. If you consider the population from sub-Saharan Africa, it represents 76% of women living with HIV (FVVIH) in IDF.\n\nWomen are at greater risk than men of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) because of biological, anatomical characteristics that make transmission from male to female easier. Women have a larger mucous membrane area exposed to pathogens and infectious fluids during heterosexual sex and are likely to experience greater tissue damage.\n\nGirls and women often face multiple, interconnected social, cultural and economic inequalities and are at increased risk of acquiring HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n\nGlobally, girls and women make up the majority of illiterate people (63%) and the poorest people (52% in 2021). In addition, gender inequalities have been amplified by the COVID-19 health crisis that has led to a significant increase in poverty rates among women. Low educational attainment and poor socio-economic status were associated with an increased risk of HIV infection among women.\n\nThe COINCIDE study focused on the IDF epidemic, with the objective of mapping new diagnoses of HIV infection between 2014 and 2021. In total, 10,827 newly-supported PLHIV were included, of which 3,327 (31%) were women living with HIV (VVIH), they were 36 years old median, 86% foreign born and almost a third (31%) were diagnosed at an advanced stage of infection (CD4 \\< 200/mm3 or AIDS). 75% of the FVVIH lived outside Paris (41% in small-crown departments 92, 93, 94 and 34% in Grande Couronne -77, 78, 91, 95) and above all, that at least 30% of them had a precarious housing (homeless or housed by a third party) at the time of taking charge, reflecting the high level of poverty among this population. Foreign-born FVVIH, which make up the vast majority of IDF's FVVIH, had a 16 times higher risk of having precarious housing compared to men who have sex with men (MSM), after adjustment in place of residence, age and immunoclinical stage at diagnosis (COINCIDE study, unpublished data).\n\nVulnerability is a particular dimension of women's health and is not sufficiently taken into account. There is a strong link between social disconnection, precariousness and health degradation. It was estimated that access to care for men in precarious situations is five times lower than the population average, with a gap nine times smaller for women.\n\nAccess to information and prevention in the field of sexual health is less in France among women who are precarious and/or migrants. The majority of young girls and women aged 15-24 in Africa do not have full knowledge about HIV. Lack of information on HIV prevention and the inability to use such information in sexual relations, including in the context of marriage, They undermine women's ability to negotiate condom use and engage in safer sex practices.\n\nAccess to information, HIV and STI testing, PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis) prevention for women, especially those who are migrants, is very poor. Thus, 4.6% of PrEP recipients in France are women, compared to a majority use to 97% by men, mainly MSM. Moreover, women are less able to negotiate their protection during sexual intercourse by the condom because of their precarious social situation ;\n\nLack of information means that too many women consider AIDS to be a male disease and are unaware of their vulnerability to the virus ;\n\nIn France, the Parcours study showed that 41% of women born in sub-Saharan Africa are infected after their arrival in France due to a socio-economic vulnerability that exposes them in an increased way. The precarious living conditions of these women expose them to sexual violence, to the exchange of sexual relations for shelter, where negotiation of the use of condoms is impossible. Indeed, the difficulties of women born abroad, the family and professional upheavals that accompany their migration to France have a major impact on their mental health and sexuality.\n\nWorldwide, 35% of women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence at some point in their lives. UNICEF reports that at least one in 10 girls is sexually abused before the age of 18. Exposure to childhood violence, especially sexual violence, increases the risk of HIV infection.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of the Interior, approximately 210,000 cases of domestic violence against women were registered in 2022. Young women aged 25-39 are overrepresented among the victims (about half), while 15% of these victims are foreign-born. These figures would underestimate the real extent of the problem since, according to the Genesis 2021 victimization survey, only one in four victims of domestic violence report their experiences to security services.\n\nIn 2021, one woman living in metropolitan France aged 18 to 74 years out of six reported having experienced sexual violence by a partner at least once since the age of 15, most often repeated. 17.8% of these women reported having been sexually abused at least once since the age of 15 by a non-partner In addition to increasing the risk of HIV infection, this violence has many short and long-term adverse consequences on the physical and mental health of victims: increased risk of use of psychoactive substances, increased risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sleep disorders, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation. In addition, victims of sexual violence have difficulties accessing specific care due to the scarcity of specialized support in health centres.\n\nMore generally, the lack of knowledge about the frequency of these forms of violence and their consequences is a hindrance to their management, even within specialized teams. This care must be multidisciplinary, provided by trained professionals and adapted to the individual situation of each woman.\n\nIn the general population, women are more affected by mental health disorders such as depressive syndromes and anxiety than men. In 2017, the prevalence of a characterized depressive syndrome was twice as high among women (13.0% vs 6.4%) compared to men in France. This high risk of mental health disorders is partly explained by an increased risk among women to be subjected to gender-based and sexual violence. Violence against women, which includes domestic and sexual violence linked to impaired mental health.\n\nThe use of psychotropic drugs among 15-75 year olds in 2010 was twice as high among women (22%) than men (12.9%). This female consumption increases with age: 11.5% for the 15-34 year old ; 23.5% for the 35-54 year old ; 32.6% for the 55-75 year old.\n\nWomen in vulnerable and precarious situations, particularly when born abroad, given the heavy toll paid to HIV infection, are a major key population to target for HIV prevention. This also highlights the need for gender-specific approaches to HIV prevention strategies.\n\nData on barriers and factors facilitating HIV testing in women are scarce in the international literature. The few studies on the subject suggest that perceived risks, fear, knowledge about testing and stigma will be the main barriers to HIV testing among women outside of the country.\n\nData on knowledge and perceptions of PrEP in women are also scarce. In addition, the adoption of PrEP by women is limited, in France (less than 5% of PrEP users) but also worldwide.\n\nThus, understanding the individual, contextual and environmental factors that influence PrEP adoption and HIV testing among women at risk of HIV infection is essential to improving targeted interventions.\n\nIkambere, \"the welcoming house\" in Kinyarwanda, was founded in 1997 by Bernadette Rwegera to meet the urgent needs of HIV-positive migrant women, often isolated and in great insecurity. The association offers a safe haven and comprehensive support, integrating therapeutic aspects and social integration.\n\nThe association also supports women who face serious health problems and live in very precarious economic and social conditions. It is one of the first associations to have integrated health mediators, perceived as essential for establishing a bond of trust, a prerequisite for continued access to care and its long-term follow-up.\n\nIn the Ile de France region, where the number of vulnerable women is particularly high and they represent a population at high risk of acquiring and transmitting STI, it is urgent to implement a specialized intervention. However, despite this urgency, the profiles, specific needs and characteristics of vulnerable women (VW) in terms of prevention and care remain largely unknown and understudied. To date, no comprehensive approach in France takes into account the dimensions of physical, sexual and mental health as well astrauma, in addition to the social and legal support necessary for the care of women in vulnerable situations.\n\nIt is in this context that the PrEVE study stands out, conducted by specialized community and association actors, it aims to assess the specific needs of vulnerable women in terms of sexual health and support victims of violence, the acceptability and feasibility of a sexual health pathway including STI screening and prevention measures.",

    "detailed_description": "Histoplasmosis is a serious endemic mycosis that may disseminate in immunocompromised patients. The disease in endemic in the American continent, particularly Brazil. Patients with advanced HIV infection are susceptible to disseminated histoplasmosis, an AIDS-defining illness. According to international guidelines, induction therapy for disseminated histoplasmosis involves the use of liposomal amphotericin B for two weeks, but access to this medication is limited in several regions of the globe. A phase II trial showed promising results with the use of a single high dose of liposomal amphotericin B in this context. Here we propose a phase III study aimed to evaluate non-inferiority of induction therapy with liposomal amphotericin B for disseminated histoplasmosis in AIDS, comparing 10 mg/kg (interventional arm) versus 3 mg/kg for two weeks (standard therapy) regarding two-week mortality and superiority in a Desirability of Outcome Ranking (DOOR). Induction therapy will be followed by oral itraconazole for one year for all patients. A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established with the aim of defining whether the study needs to be stopped early for efficacy or harm to the study participants. The group will meet every 12 months to review the study data.\n\nA steering committee made up of external members will advise and evaluate the study. Meetings will be held every 3 months. In addition, a medical committee made up of members of the study will be responsible for monitoring the progress of the study in order to maintain quality in all its aspects, with weekly meetings.\n\nFor data analysis, continuous variables will be described using mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range, minimum and maximum. Categorical variables will be described using absolute and relative frequencies. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to describe overall survival. To assess the primary outcome, the proportions in each arm and the respective 90% confidence intervals will be evaluated. Continuous variables will be compared using two-sample t-tests, paired-sample t-tests, Mann-Whitney test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate and if necessary. Categorical variables will be compared with Fisher\\&#39;s exact test or chi-squared test, as appropriate. Ordinal DOOR analysis will be done with logistic regression to determine odds ratios.\n\nTo control the type I error rate for testing of the primary and major secondary endpoint, a hierarchical strategy will be used. Superiority assessments after successful testing of non-inferiority hypotheses will be performed. There is no multiplicity argument affecting this interpretation, as this approach corresponds to a simple closed testing procedure. The sample size calculation will consider the overall 2-week mortality in the L-AmB control observed in the phase II study (i.e. \\~8%). The planned calculation is 279 patients (127 patients per study arm). The sample size is based on a power of 90% to detect a non-inferiority margin of 10% with a two-tailed p-alpha of 5% (i.e. one-sided confidence interval margin of 90%). An expectation of 10% of patients lost to follow-up is added, bringing the sample size to 279 patients (approximately 140 per arm). If the mortality observed in the study is higher than expected, a larger sample size will be necessary. The data will be analyzed using SPSS 27.0 software. If non-inferiority is achieved, the study will be tested for superiority using the DOOR scare. An a priori adaptive sample size is proposed to maintain statistical power if the assumption about two-week mortality is incorrect. A hierarchical testing strategy is proposed to test for superiority of key secondary endpoints of amphotericin-related laboratory toxicity and a DOOR scale. A sample size of 150 participants per arm in a parallel two-group design will be used to test whether distribution of DOOR scores differs between groups (H0: \u03bc1 - \u03bc2 = 0 versus H1: \u03bc1 - \u03bc2 \u2260 0). The comparison will be made using a two-sided, two-sample Mann-Whitney U test, with a Type I error rate \u03b1 of 0.05. The common standard deviation for both groups is assumed to be 1.5, and the underlying data distribution is assumed to be normal. To detect a difference in means of 0.5 with 80% power, the number of needed subjects will be 300.\n\nFinancial support for this study was provided by the following institutions:\n\nGilead - donation of medication and financial support (USD 393,600); Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (FINEP/MCTI - Brazil) (USD 355,883.10); and IMMY: donation of diagnostic devices (50 boxes - HGM201, 51 boxes - CR2025);",

They have the highest overall cancer death rate and shortest survival time of any racial or ethnic group in the United States. Elucidation of disparities in access to cancer care are important since previous work has indicated that when equal access to RT in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) prospective randomized trials is granted, race does not independently affect outcomes, a finding similar to work conducted in Level I evidence-proven optimal management of curable neurologic conditions. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in African-American women and Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in African-American men. African-American breast \\& prostate cancer participants are less likely to receive standard-of-care radiation therapy.\n\nPrevious work has identified that compared to Caucasian women with breast cancer, African-American women are 48% more likely to have RT omission during treatment, 167% less likely to receive timely completion of RT after breast-conserving surgery, 40% less likely to complete RT, and significantly more likely to experience RT treatment delays. Shorter course radiation therapy may reduce disparities in radiation therapy care facing African-American breast cancer participants.",

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) such as sacituzumab govitecan (SG) and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) have changed practice due to significant improvement in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) seen in this disease setting. There is a genuine interest to use SG sequentially after T-DXd, however there is no current prospectively curated evidence to support this strategy. Though the epitope is different, the payload are both topoisomerase I inhibitors. Thus, evidence is needed of both clinical efficacy and identification of mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to sequential ADCs in HER-2 low MBC.\n\nIt is hypothesized that performing whole genome and whole transcriptome sequencing in fresh tumour biopsies post progression of T-DXd and prior to SG in ER+/HER2 low metastatic breast cancer (MBC) will provide mechanistic insights into identifying biomarkers, and thus patients, sensitive to sequential SG.",
    "detailed_description": "This is a prospective single-centre Canadian study (BC Cancer Vancouver) enrolling ER+/HER2 low MBC with disease progression after at least one line of endocrine therapy in combination with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor and at least one line of chemotherapy which must include T-DXd as the immediate prior line of treatment in the advanced stage setting.\n\nPatients will receive SG at an initial dose of 10 mg per kilogram intravenously on day 1 and 8 of 21 day cycles. Treatment will continue until evidence of progressive disease, significant toxicity in which patient and or physician wishes to discontinue treatment and/or patient or physician desire to discontinue treatment for any reason.\n\nTumor specimens will collected from biopsies between the time of informed consent and prior to first administration of SG. The pathology will be reviewed and nucleic acids extracted. Constitutional DNA representing normal cells will be extracted from peripheral blood. PCR-free DNA libraries and either strand-specific or ribo-depleted RNA libraries will be constructed. Following which whole genome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing will be performed.",

Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors like avelumab require activation of the patient's immune system.\n\nThis trial includes a two week induction or lead-in of medications that can stimulate the immune system. It is our hope that this induction will improve the response to immunotherapy with avelumab. One treatment, sacituzumab Govitecan, is a monoclonal antibody called sacituzumab linked to a chemotherapy drug called SN-38. Sacituzumab govitecan is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as Tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TROP2) receptors, and delivers SN-38 to kill them. Another treatment, liposomal doxorubicin, is a form of the anticancer drug doxorubicin that is contained in very tiny, fat-like particles. It may have fewer side effects and work better than doxorubicin, and may enhance factors associated with immune response. The third medication is called binimetinib, which may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth, and may help activate the immune system. It is not yet known whether giving avelumab in combination with liposomal doxorubicin with or without binimetinib, or the combination of avelumab with sacituzumab govitecan will work better in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer.",

    "detailed_description": "Although ART decreases HIV-associated mortality, it does not appear to completely restore immune health, for reasons that remain unclear. In addition, while HIV prevention approaches have led to significant successes in decreasing the incidence of new HIV infection over the past few years, the epidemic continues to grow both locally and globally. While complete eradication may not currently be feasible, a \"functional cure\" in which patients are able to indefinitely maintain undetectable viral loads in the absence of therapy may be an attainable immediate goal. Studying patients with early HIV infection and immediate ART will provide a unique opportunity to investigate the pathophysiology of the earliest stages of HIV infection and may help identify the virologic/immunologic predictors of a functional cure.",

Patients with MIBC N0/N1 unwilling or unfit for cystectomy will receive SG + Zimberelimab for 3 cycles of treatment prior of first radiological and TURB re-evaluation.\n\nApproximately 63 patients will be enrolled and assigned to study intervention. At screening, a tumor specimen from TURBT or biopsy done as early as 90 days prior to enrollment will be submitted for central pathology review. All participants will undergo baseline screening imaging (CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen, pelvis) for clinical staging.\n\nEligible participants will be allocated to study intervention which consist in SG + Zimberelimab for 3 cycles followed by Zimberelimab for 13 cycles in patients who achieve CR/PR/SD at tumor evaluation.\n\nThe planned total duration of treatment is approximately 1 year, 3 cycles of SG and 16 cycles of Zimberelimab.\n\nTreatment will be discontinued if the participant experiences unacceptable AE(s), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, the investigator's decision to withdraw the participant, the participant withdraws consent, pregnancy of the participant, noncompliance with study intervention or procedure requirements, or the maximum number of cycles has been received for each treatment component individually.\n\nParticipants will complete 3 cycles of induction study intervention, followed by repeat imaging studies (same modality as screening) within \u22644 weeks (21 days +/- 7 days) after C3D21 to exclude disease progression. mpMRI/contrast-enhanced or CT scan will assess local invasion by T3 disease or higher and the radiological response to treatment.\n\nParticipants who remain radiographically free of distant metastases and PR/SD/CR RECIST v1.1 will proceed to TURBT within 6 weeks of the last dose of SG. TURBT will enable histopathological re-staging and will evaluate pathological response to treatment. The inclusion of bladder muscle in the resection specimen is required. Cystoscopy will be performed before TURBT, as indicated in the Schedule of Activities.\n\nPatients with no evidence of disease at the cystoscopy, will undergo bladder mapping in case of positive urine cytology. In case of negative urine cytology, patients will be considered in as complete respose, in case of no evidence of disease at radiological evaluation.\n\nParticipants with radiological progression to metastatic disease or locally advanced disease (from cT2 to cT4 or from N0 to N1), as assessed radiographically, at this time will be considered to have met the primary endpoint of EFS (ie, had an \"event\") and will not receive further therapy on study, but will transition into survival follow-up and will be treated as per clinical practice.\n\nParticipants with pathological downstaging and radiological complete or partial response will continue to receive zimberelimab for 13 cycles (16 cycles as a total) to complete approximately 1 year of total therapy.\n\nNon-responder patients who will maintain radiological or pathological stability will choose to undergo RC or RT/CT or to continue Zimberelimab for 1 years. Additional TURBT could be performed in order to achieve local control, according to the centre clinical practice.\n\nResponse to study intervention will be assessed through TURBT and CT SCAN and/or MRI. Imaging should continue to be performed until an EFS event occurs or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. If new anticancer therapy is initiated, this should be documented.\n\nAll subjects will be followed for OS every 3 months until death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal of study consent. Additional survival follow-up may continue for up to 3-5 years from the time of this analysis. To evaluate metastasis free survival, subjects will be monitored by radiographic assessment and cystoscopy on an every-12-week schedule (\u00b15 days). RECIST 1.1 criteria will be used for the assessment. Subjects will be evaluated at every SG + Zimberelimab dose administration plus two additional follow-up visits for safety within the first 100 days from the last dose of study therapy. Beyond 100 days from the last dose of study therapy, subjects will be followed for ongoing drug-related adverse events until resolved, return to baseline or deemed irreversible, or until lost to follow-up, or withdrawal of study consent.\n\nTo assess local recurrence, cystoscopy will be performed every 12 weeks (+/- 1 7 days). In case of local recurrence, patients could be managed with TURBT as per clinical practice, in case patients will still be unfit for cystectomy or refuse surgery.",

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Pembrolizumab for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, but it is currently approved only for patients with PD-L1-positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.\n\nIn this research study, we are:\n\n* Studying Sacituzumab Govitecan alone or in combination with Pembrolizumab as a possible treatment for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancers that are PD-L1-negative.\n* Sacituzumab Govitecan is composed of a chemotherapy drug, called Irinotecan, which is attached to an antibody. Antibodies are proteins normally made by the immune system that bind to substances that don't belong in the body to prevent harm. The antibody in this study binds to certain types of cancer tumors, including triple-negative breast tumors.\n* Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy, called an anti-PD-1 or a checkpoint inhibitor, and is an antibody (a type of human protein) designed to allow the body's own immune system to seek out and destroy tumors. It has been used in previous research studies to treat breast cancer, where it has been shown to be effective.\n* The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of either Sacituzumab Govitecan alone or in combination with Pembrolizumab, in delaying the worsening of triple-negative breast cancers that are PD-L1-negative.\n\nThe research study procedures include: screening for eligibility, research blood collections, at least two research biopsies, paired research stool collections, questionnaires, data collection, and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nParticipants will be randomized into one of two groups.\n\n* Group A: Sacituzumab Govitecan on days 1 and 8 and Pembrolizumab on day 1 of a 21-day cycle\n* Group B: Sacituzumab Govitecan alone on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment for as long as they are benefitting from this therapy. Participants will be followed for the rest of their life.\n\nIt is expected that about 110 people will take part in this research study.",

If patients do not wish to have a warm handoff call with a new-patient coordinator (NPC) in the NPO who will schedule the patient's consult with a surgeon and/or oncologist, or if patients are diagnosed external to Penn Medicine, the patient coordinator will follow up directly with the patient to facilitate communication and enrollment within 24 hours of diagnosis.\n\nAll patients who do not opt out will be part of the analytic cohort and randomized to one of three screening assessment tools:\n\n1. Accountable Health Communities Health-Related Social Needs Screening Tool (AHC-HSRN);\n2. Health Leads Social Needs Screening Toolkit (Health Leads);\n3. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Distress Thermometer + Problem List (NCCN DT+PL).\n\n   . The initial request for completion will be administered via the institutional EHR's Epic-based patient portal. Patients will have 48 hours to respond and will receive 2 reminders via a MyPennMedicine message (MPM), through which a patient can also indicate a desire to opt-out if they wish.\n\n   Patients who do not respond and remain enrolled will be randomized to either a bidirectional text-based conversational agent (i.e., \"chatbot\") or interactive voice response (IVR) system administered by phone. Through the first arm, patients will engage with the screening tool through an interactive two-way text messaging chatbot through WaytoHealth\u00a9. Through the second arm, patients will be called over the phone and will receive the screening tool through interactive voice recognition. Patients will again have 48 hours to respond and will receive 2 reminders via the modality to which they have been newly randomized. Patients have the opportunity to opt out through either modality and discontinue study.\n\n   Patients who have not completed the screen via any modality by the time of their first surgical consult at Penn after diagnosis, will be provided the opportunity to complete it electronically though a tablet at the clinic appointment. At any point, patients who report challenges with particular SBDOH domains can be referred prior to initial surgical consultation to Social Services at Abramson Cancer Center.\n\n   Approximately 6 months following diagnosis and initial completion in the study trial (Activity 1), a subset of patients (identified via deviant sampling) will be invited to participate in semi-structured interviews (Activity 2) through which mechanisms contributing to the effectiveness of the SBDOH data collection platform will be evaluated.

During Stage 1, four cohorts will be enrolled in parallel in this study:\n\nCohort 1 will consist of Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive participants who have received no prior systemic therapy for metastatic or inoperable locally advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (first-line \\[1L\\] PD-L1+ cohort).\n\nCohort 2 will consist of participants who had disease progression during or following 1L treatment with chemotherapy for metastatic or inoperable locally-advanced TNBC and have not received cancer immunotherapy (CIT) (second-line \\[2L\\] CIT-naive cohort).\n\nCohort 3 will consist of participants with locally-advanced or metastatic HR+, HER2-negative disease with PIK3CA mutation who may or may not have had disease progression during or following previous lines of treatment for metastatic disease (HR+cohort).\n\nCohort 4 will consist of participants with locally-advanced or metastatic HER2+ /HER2-low disease with PIK3CA mutation who had disease progression on standard-of-care therapies (HER2+ /HER2-low cohort).\n\nIn each cohort, eligible participants will initially be assigned to one of several treatment arms (Stage 1). In addition, participants in the 2L CIT-na\u00efve cohort who experience disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, or unacceptable toxicity during Stage 1 may be eligible to continue treatment with a different treatment combination (Stage 2), provided Stage 2 is open for enrollment.",

    "detailed_description": "The goal of this study is to determine whether incorporating a telehealth model that allows for same-day appointments for PrEP delivery with the support of navigation leads to increased uptake and persistence of PrEP in young MSM/transgender of color and individuals in rural communities that have disproportionately not used PrEP. The investigators will accomplish this by using an effectiveness-hybrid design that will allow us to both evaluate the interventions impact on relevant clinical outcomes as well as the effectiveness of the implementation strategy. Our hypothesis is that by removing some of the barriers to care such as transportation, childcare, work schedule and potentially stigma with repeated clinic visits, the investigators will increase the uptake and persistence of PrEP amongst communities who historically have had many barriers to care and have not started PrEP.",

Colorado's 2019 HIV/AIDS Prevention Program state-wide review of PrEP barriers showed PrEP eligible individuals do not access PrEP services due to lack of interest, not wanting referral to a navigator, and low estimation of HIV risk. The overall goal is to provide youth at higher risk for HIV with an effective youth informed telemedicine delivery of PrEP (TelePrEP) that addresses PrEP barriers and contributes to ending the HIV epidemic in Colorado. The primary objective will be proportion of youth retained on PrEP 12 months after initiation. The hypotheses are that a TelePrEP model for youth will be acceptable and feasible and will result in successful initiation, persistence and retention on oral PrEP.",
