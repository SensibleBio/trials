If 4 or more of the 19 patients have a response, then accrual would continue to stage II until a total of 55 patients have been enrolled. As it may take several weeks to determine if a patient has experienced a response, a temporary pause in the accrual to the trial may be necessary to ensure that enrollment to the second stage is warranted.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine if Talzenna\u00ae can help breast cancer patients who have not inherited an altered BRCA gene. We have identified a genetic signature called HRD100 which identifies patients who may respond to Talzenna\u00ae.\n\nDisease status will be followed by imaging studies at interval of every 12 weeks, until disease progression, start of non-study treatment, withdrawal of consent to study participation, death or end of the study. RECIST 1.1 will be used as the primary endpoint of the response rate. Safety will be monitored according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 (Appendix 2).\n\nStudy Treatment will continue until any of the following occurs:\n\n1. Disease progression, as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumour (RECIST version 1.1);\n2. Unacceptable toxicity;\n3. Intercurrent illness that necessitates discontinuation of study treatment;\n4. Investigator's decision to withdraw the subject,\n5. Pregnancy;\n6.

The primary hypothesis of this study is that the addition of a multifaceted intervention incorporating integrated multidisciplinary rheumatologic care, nurse-directed self-management education and supportive follow-up, and technology-based at home RA symptom monitoring and reporting to clinical guideline-based care will increase RA remission rate at 6 months.",
    "detailed_description": "One hundred and fifty Hispanic RA patients will be recruited for this proposal and randomized 1:1 to Intervention and Control arms for a period of 12 months. Participants will be recruited from the Adult Rheumatology clinic at Harbor-UCLA. Patients who meet enrollment criteria based on review of electronic medical records will be provided information about the study during regular outpatient visits. Interested patients will be formally screened.\n\nAfter providing informed consent, eligible patients will complete baseline measures and be randomly assigned into Intervention and Control arms using a minimization protocol, with a goal of enrolling 150 patients (75 in each group). All participants will attend rheumatology clinic appointments scheduled quarterly for the 12-month trial duration, during which they will also complete assessments (at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-baseline; see description of outcomes for full detail). Between appointments with their assigned rheumatologist, participants will regularly self-monitor their RA symptoms using the Routine Assessment Patient Index Data (RAPID3) questionnaire administered via an interactive voice response (IVR) phone survey weekly for 12 months.\n\nAt baseline, participants will be enrolled in the IVR system and the study coordinator will provide a detailed orientation to the automated phone survey as well as written instructions including the toll-free phone number, and a unique study personal identification number. Participants will each select the day and the hours between which they will complete the weekly phone survey. After entering their unique study personal identification number, participants will complete the 12-item RAPID3 questionnaire, entering responses using their telephone keypad. If they do not call in and complete the survey on their preselected day during the specified time frame, they will receive a reminder call an hour later from the time by which they would have been expected to call in.\n\nAt the baseline visit, all participants will receive a rheumatoid arthritis educational booklet that provides general disease state information, including an overview of RA (e.g., its causes, associated symptoms, how it is diagnosed), RA medications and other treatment options, pain management, physical activity, nutrition and diet. The material is written at a sixth grade reading level and incorporates simple figures and graphics to enhance readability and promote participant comprehension and engagement. The study coordinator will also give each participant a pedometer and provide instruction for its use. Participants will be encouraged to wear the pedometer during waking hours and record their total daily steps in a log, along with the type and duration of other activities like swimming that pedometers do not capture.\n\nControl arm participants will receive standard of care treatment from their assigned rheumatologists. Pharmacotherapy will be monitored and adjusted by the treating rheumatologist in accordance with evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Physical Therapy referrals and evaluations will occur as indicated for addressing specific problems. Referral for psychological services will be provided when patients endorse symptoms of depression in response to a verbal screen or participant-initiated discussion. Control arm participants will also have regularly scheduled 20-30 minute monthly phone calls with the healthcare coordinator. While questions and concerns specifically raised by participants regarding study procedure and the content of the educational booklet will be addressed, these phone calls are primarily designed to control for potential benefit participants may derive from time on the phone with a health professional. The healthcare coordinator will engage participants using a non-directive approach based on use of active listening, reflective statements and similar techniques.\n\nIntervention arm participants will receive integrated treatment from a multidisciplinary healthcare team during the routine clinic visits. In addition to appointments with their assigned rheumatologist, a physical therapist will assess participants' physical functioning, provide joint protection guidance and assist patients in making physical fitness plans based on their own goals and tailored to patients' abilities and physical limitations. Interim individual physical therapy sessions will be scheduled in accordance with the physical therapist's recommendations. Additionally, if during any routine clinic appointment a participant scores 10 or higher on the PHQ-9 and/or endorses symptoms of depression in response to a verbal screen, they will receive a same-day, in-clinic psychological evaluation. The psychologist will assess whether patient symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder and, when clinically indicated, provide recommendations for treatment. Follow-up treatment appointments will be scheduled with patients by the psychologist.\n\nIn addition to regularly scheduled rheumatology appointments, if between-visit patient self-monitoring reports indicate an increase in RA disease activity (flare), participants in the intervention arm will be scheduled for an ad hoc evaluation with their assigned rheumatologist. Specifically, if participants' RAPID3 surveys show two consecutive week-to-week score increases and the cumulative two week RAPID3 increase is greater than 1.2 points, they will be contacted by the study coordinator that day (or following morning if surveys are completed after regular office hours) to schedule an ad-hoc appointment with their rheumatologist within 2 working days. During routine and ad hoc intervention arm patient visits, while clinical practice guidelines will inform rheumatologist monitoring of pharmacotherapy, the treatment planning process will be grounded in a shared decision making framework.\n\nParticipants in the intervention arm will further be provided a one-on-one tailored education session with a trained rheumatology nurse that will encompass a general disease state education, incorporating pictograms and short slide presentations, an introduction of the treat to target concept, overview of treatment options, and discussion of patient priorities and identification of personally salient long-term treatment-related goals. During regularly scheduled 20-30 minute monthly follow-up phone calls with each intervention arm participant, the rheumatology nurse will address individual educational needs, answer questions and reinforce learning. Goal setting, planning and review will also be conducted. Specifically, participants will select goals to be achieved in the upcoming month and be assisted in developing specific action plans. The rheumatology nurse will also check in about their work and progress on action plans discussed in the last phone call. Any barriers encountered will be explored and participants will be engaged in a problem-solving process, revising existing action plans as needed.",

    "brief_summary": "Background: The prevalence of both senile cardiac amyloidosis (CA) and aortic stenosis (AS) markedly increases with age. Aortic stenosis increases left ventricular pressure overload. Cardiac deposits have been observed in AS and the amount of these deposits has been correlated to post-surgical outcome. As they are strong echocardiographic and cardiac MRI imaging similarities between CA and AS, the investigators hypothesized that the deposit observed in AS is transthyretin amyloid deposit. The investigators objective is to demonstrate that amyloid deposit is associated with poor outcomes following aortic stenosis surgical valve replacement.\n\nMateriel and methods: 180 patients with indication for surgical aortic valve replacement will be recruited prospectively and consecutively in 5 French centers. A replicative study will be performed in one Austrian center. Echocardiography, cardiac MRI and bone scintigraphy will be performed prior to surgery. During surgery, a basal LV septum biopsy will be collected for determination and quantification of interstitial deposits using specific staining which will be performed in a blind fashion. Clinical outcomes will be recorded during the hospitalization period following the surgery and at 1 year. Alive and re-hospitalization status will be determined. Patients will be classified according to the presence or not of amyloid deposits.\n\nExpected results and impact: This study will emphasize how pressure overload stress accelerates and magnifies amyloid deposition usually known to be related to cardiac aging process. It will develop reliable imaging tools and markers to detect cardiac amyloid deposition. Correlation between anatomopathologic analyses and the three different imaging technics will identify accurate imaging markers of CA. A risk stratification model based on amyloid deposits level for the clinical management of these patients will be created combining imaging and biological markers.",
    "detailed_description": "Cardiovascular diseases remain the major cause of mortality and morbidity in industrialised countries. Their prevalence increases steeply as consequence of the aging of the population in these countries. Curiously, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases share common aging pathological pathways involving abnormal accumulation of insoluble amyloid proteins in the extracellular matrix disrupting normal organ function. Whereas neurological amyloid diseases has been considerably investigated, little attention has been paid to the aggregation of amyloid proteins in cardiovascular diseases. Post-mortem studies have identified cardiac wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis deposition in 25% of individuals over the age of 80 years leading to the concept of \"senile cardiac amyloidosis\" (CA) (Cornwell, Am j Med 1984; Pitkanen, Am J Pathol 1984). The cause of this deposition is not yet known but might be related primarily to aging process and enhanced by cardiac mechanical stress (overload), hypoxia, oxidative stress and inflammation. Since patients with transthyretin CA develop severe heart failure with poor prognosis, it is crucial to identify them especially among population at risk such those with aortic stenosis (AS). Indeed this common valvular heart disease affects mainly senescent subjects and combines so the adverse effects on myocardial function of both pressure overload and myocardial aging.\n\nInterestingly, some elderly patients with severe AS exhibit similar echocardiographic and cardiac MRI patterns as those reported in CA including increased cardiac wall thickness and progressive left ventricular dysfunction starting with alteration of basal LV-2D strain. They also exhibit increased late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) at cardiac MRI. This has been interpreted as related to interstitial myocardial \"fibrosis\" and has been correlated with poor prognosis after aortic valve replacement i.e.; high mortality, persistence of heart failure symptoms and LV dysfunction (Weidemann Circ 2009; Dweck, JACC 2011; Hermann JACC 2011). However none of these patients have benefited from a detailed histology analysis with aiming at identifying amyloid deposits. The investigators have recently found similar clinical observations in the investigators AS cohort. Using specific staining, the investigators were able to unmask the association of severe AS and CA in these patients. These preliminary findings raise the question of a potential pathophysiological link between CA and AS and might explain why some patients with AS may not benefit from cardiac surgery.",

    "brief_summary": "Breast cancer is an optimal \"model disease\" for studying personalized medicine. Breast cancer was the first malignancy for which a predictive factor forecasting response to therapy was identified nearly 50 years ago; the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER). Furthermore, breast cancer is by far the malignancy in which prognostic and predictive factors have been most extensively studied. Primary medical treatment (pre-surgical medical therapy) offers a unique setting to explore predictive factors due to the fact that primary breast cancers are easily accessible to repeated tissue sampling and evaluation of therapy response both clinically and radiologically. For many years, the investigators have studied predictive factors in primary medical treatment of breast cancer. In the present project, the investigators will implement a new trial concept where the current knowledge from previous trials with respect to predictive markers (hormone receptors, HER2; TP53, CHEK2 and RB1), will be combined with massive parallel sequencing (MPS). Thereby, the investigators aim to design the \"next-generation\" primary medical treatment where 1) therapy regimens are individualized based on a limited number of known predictive factors and, 2) MPS is used to explore additional predictive factors and their co-regulators in order to fully identify the mechanisms of drug sensitivity / resistance across individual tumours and pave the way for further personalized breast cancer therapy in the future. As for the new era of \"genomic medicine\", the current trial concept will allow individual tumours to be characterized by their unique gene mutation / epigenetic modification profile upfront, to allocate patients to their optimal personalized medicine as compared to \"classical\" drug testing through phase II/III trials.",

Once tumors have grown bigger in one place but haven't spread, they're called locally advanced. If your cancer has spread to other parts of your body, it's called metastatic. When a cancer has gotten so big it can't easily be removed or has spread to other parts of the body, it is called unresectable. These types of cancer are harder to treat.\n\nParticipants in this study must have cancer that has come back or did not get better with treatment. Participants must have a solid tumor cancer that can't be treated with standard of care drugs.\n\nThis clinical trial uses an experimental drug called PF-08046050. PF-08046050 is a type of antibody-drug conjugate or ADC. ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them. They may also stick to some normal cells.\n\nThis study will test the safety of PF-08046050 in participants with solid tumors that are hard to treat or have spread throughout the body.\n\nThis study has 5 different study parts. Part A and Part B of the study will find out how much PF-08046050 should be given to participants. Part C will use the information from Parts A and B to see if PF-08046050 is safe and if it works to treat certain solid tumor cancers. Part D of the study, together with information from Parts A and B, will find out how much PF-08046050 should be given to participants in combination with bevacizumab. Part E will use the information from Parts A, B, and D to see if PF-08046050 is safe in combination with bevacizumab and if it works to treat a certain solid tumor.",

    "detailed_description": "The overarching goal of this clinical trial is to reduce the incidence of incurable recurrent metastatic breast cancer by targeting the precursors of these recurrences, bone marrow disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) present after definitive treatment. This trial targets unique mechanisms by which DTCs maintain a dormant phenotype (autophagy) and by which they escape dormancy (upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase4/6 (CDK4/6) pathway and microenvironmental factors such as immune evasion). The selection of these agents is based upon strong preclinical data demonstrating the relevance of autophagy (inhibited by HCQ), the CDK4/6 pathway (inhibited by palbociclib) and the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint pathway (blocked by avelumab) as critical mechanisms of cellular and immunological tumor dormancy.\n\nThe phase II trial is designed to provide \"proof of concept\" and estimates of effect of various combinations and durations of these therapies on bone marrow DTCs as a surrogate for ultimate reduction in recurrence. The correlative science aims will provide additional insight into the relationship between the primary tumor and both the biology of DTCs and host immune surveillance for target validation and development, as well as evaluate the role of additional biomarkers both in the bone marrow (with a novel flow-based assay), and in the peripheral circulation (including both circulating tumor cells and cell-free DNA), to identify patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) and targets for intervention and measurement of DTC response.",

Pancreas is a long, flat gland that lies in the abdomen behind the stomach. Pancreas creates enzymes that help with digestion. It also makes hormones that can help control your blood sugar levels.\n\nAll participants in this study will take the study medication (PF-07934040) as pill by mouth twice a day repeating for 21-day or 28-day cycles.\n\nDepending on which part of the study participants are enrolled into they will receive the study medication (PF-07934040 alone or in combination with other anti-cancer medications). These anti-cancer medications will be given in the study clinic by intravenous (IV) that is directly injected into the veins at various times (depending on the treatment) during the 21-day or 28-day cycle.\n\nParticipants can continue to take the study medication (PF-07934040) and the combination anti-cancer therapy until their cancer is no longer responding.\n\nThe study will look at the experiences of people receiving the study medicines. This will help see if the study medicines are safe and effective.\n\nParticipants will be involved in this study for up to 4 years. During this time, they will come into the clinic between 1 to 4 times in each 21-day or 28-day cycle. After they have stopped taking the study medication (at about at 2 years) they will be followed for another two years to see how they are doing.",

Palbociclib is an oral drug which has been shown to stop the cell cycle, which is the way a cell initiates growth. Gedatolisib is thought to work by controlling a series of events directing cell growth and survival. Gedatolisib may work to stop or slow activity within tumor cells. By putting these two drugs together the investigators hope that it will have a greater effect on cancer growth than either drug alone.",

    "detailed_description": "The first line treatment of urothelial carcinoma is a platinum-based chemotherapy. This treatment is efficient with a response rate \\> 50 % but the progression-free survival is short (7.7 months) and the chemotherapy is too toxic to be used in a prolonged time. Traditionally, maintenance chemotherapy refers to the utilization of regimens with less toxicity after the initial upfront treatment. This concept has already been efficient with PARP inhibitors in ovarian carcinoma and more recently with durvalumab in lung carcinoma.\n\nThe prevalence of somatic mutations in homologous recombination genes in UC as well as their association with platinum sensitivity suggests Talazoparib to be a target for a maintenance treatment of urothelial carcinoma. Moreover, there is a strong rational with both pre-clinical and clinical data to associate Avelumab and Talazoparib. This appears all the more relevant that Avelumab has already demonstrated its efficacy in urothelial carcinoma (after platinum-based chemotherapy failure).\n\nIn this context, the sponsorpropose a phase 2 study to assess the antitumor activity of the combination of Avelumab plus Talazoparib in metastatic urothelial carcinoma in maintenance therapy after platinum-based chemotherapy.\n\nConsidering the doubts about the best molecular predictive factors of Talazoparib and Avelumab, the sponsor willingly propose a non-selective study, without molecular screening. Tumors will be selected according to the platinum sensitivity which has the advantage to exclude poor prognosis tumors and will allow increasing the HRD tumor population.",

Current guidelines recommend steroid treatment for IMDC CTCAE grade \u2265 2, which requires temporary or permanent cessation of ICI therapy. Corticosteroids may interfere with the anti-tumor activity of ICIs and are therefore not co-administered. Strategies are needed to both reduce the dose and duration of corticosteroids needed for IMDC treatment and minimize the duration off ICI therapy before re-administering ICI (for those patients in whom it is deemed safe to rechallenge).",

If intestinal infectious studies are positive the participant will be excluded from the study. Due to the acute nature of some cases of IMDC (e.g., grade 4 IMDC), some participants may require initiation of corticosteroids before enrollment. In these cases, participants may be enrolled if the first dose of etrasimod or placebo can be administered within 96 hours of the first dose of corticosteroids.

    "detailed_description": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc, Scleroderma) is a multisystem autoimmune disease characterized by widespread vascular injury and progressive fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. Internal organ involvement results in increased mortality of SSc patients. There is no effective treatment for the majority of patients with early active diffuse scleroderma (diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis; dcSSc). It's possible to reverse immune inflammation and reduce the probability of irreversible fibrosis early in the disease course via significant immune modulation. The preliminary results of the Phase II study of Brentuximab vedotin (Protocol BV201708) in SSc demonstrated the short-term safety and benefits of this treatment as many participants already achieved the primary endpoint at 24 weeks. This study is proposed as an extension of the ongoing protocol for up to 48 weeks to make the treatment available for SSc patients who have significantly improved on Brentuximab vedotin, but relapsed after discontinuation of the treatment. Similar to the ongoing Phase II study, the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), patient and physician global scores, inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP), and combined response index in SSc (CRISS) and changes in CD30-stained cells on skin biopsies with IHC will all be exploratory outcomes.",

    "detailed_description": "Study Groups:\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have a CT scan of your chest to look for signs of lung cancer. You will receive the results 0-4 days after the scan. If there are any abnormal areas, you will be referred to your regular doctor for follow-up. No matter what the results are, you will be advised to quit smoking. If you have previously had a low dose CT scan for lung cancer screening in the last 30 days, you may still be eligible to participate in this study. You will be asked to provide documentation of the CT scan results.\n\nYou will receive a referral for counseling to help you reduce/quit smoking. You may also discuss medications you can take to reduce smoking.\n\nAs part of your counseling treatment, you may be prescribed an FDA-approved and commercially available anti-smoking drug. This may be either nicotine replacement therapy (such as a patch, gum, or lozenge) or an oral drug (such as varenicline or buproprion). The provider will tell you when and how much of your anti-smoking drug you should take each time, based on a discussion between you and your provider. Receiving anti-smoking medication will be done through your counseling treatment and not as part of your participation in this study.\n\nYou will have at least 5, but no more than 8, smoking cessation counseling sessions over the next 12 weeks. Each session will last between 30 - 60 minutes, in which you will set a quit date, prepare for your quit date, and discuss coping skills for dealing with smoking \"triggers\" after your quit date. You will also discuss challenges you may have with quitting.\n\nStudy Visits:\n\nYou will have 3 additional study visits, at around 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after the screening visit, as well as 1 follow-up phone call. At all study visits:\n\n* You will complete questionnaires about several topics, including depression, suicide, and your smoking behavior. These questionnaires should take about 30-45 minutes in total to complete.\n* Your CO level will be measured.\n* Urine and/or saliva may be collected (at 12 weeks and 6 months only) for a routine test to check your cotinine and nicotine. Cotinine is a chemical released in your body when it breaks down nicotine and will show whether and how much you have recently smoked.\n\nFollow-Up:\n\nAbout 5 months after you start receiving counseling sessions, you will be called by a member of the study staff and asked about your recent smoking behaviors and habits. This call should last about 5-10 minutes.",

However, only 25% of persons with MDR-TB were diagnosed and started on treatment, reflecting inadequate diagnostic capacity and lack of TB treatment capacity.\n\nIn this multicenter, randomized, partially blinded, four-arm, phase 2 study, the investigators will examine the efficacy and safety of an all-oral regimen of bedaquiline, delamanid, levofloxacin, linezolid, and clofazimine given for 16, 24, 32 or 40 weeks",
    "detailed_description": "Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is tuberculosis that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most important drugs in treating TB. In 2017, approximately 558,000 new people were estimated to have developed MDR-TB, and 8.5% of the cases had extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB).(1) Current WHO-endorsed MDR-TB treatment regimens take 9-20 months to complete and are associated with substantial toxicity, including deafness from injectable agents, hepatitis from pyrazinamide and severe neuropathy from linezolid. Given the long duration and toxicities of MDR-TB regimens, it is perhaps not surprising that WHO reports that only 25% of patients with MDR-TB are enrolled into WHO-endorsed treatment regimens. Thus, there is an urgent need for shorter, less toxic treatments for MDR-TB. This proposal will determine the efficacy, safety, tolerability and optimal duration of a novel, all oral MDR-TB treatment regimen while addressing three major challenges with innovations that have the potential to transform future trials.\n\nThe proposed DRAMATIC (Duration Randomized Anti-MDR-TB And Tailored Intervention Clinical) Trial is a multicenter, randomized, partially blinded, four-arm, phase 2 trial that will examine an injectable- and pyrazinamide-sparing regimen of bedaquiline, delamanid, levofloxacin, linezolid, and clofazimine. The DRAMATIC regimen limits the administration of linezolid to the initial 8 weeks of treatment, the window before linezolid-related neuropathy occurs. Animal and human studies provide evidence for the potential efficacy of this 5-drug regimen, but the optimal duration of treatment remains uncertain.(2-4)\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\n1. Describe the relationship between the duration of the experimental regimen and the proportion of participants with sustained cure at 76 weeks after randomization without treatment failure or relapse.\n2. Describe the relationship between baseline prognostic risk strata and sustained cure at 76 weeks after randomization without treatment failure or relapse.\n3. Evaluate the association between novel biologic markers and sustained cure at 76 weeks after randomization without treatment failure or relapse.\n\n   Secondary Objectives:\n4. Identify the shortest duration of the study regimen that has acceptable safety and efficacy for a Phase 3 clinical trial of the DRAMATIC regimen for treatment of MDR-TB.\n5. Describe the frequency, magnitude, time course of and risk factors for QTc prolongation associated with the study regimen.\n6. Demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of implementing the new duration-randomized design in a multi-centre randomized trial of drug-resistant TB.\n7. Determine if time to sputum culture conversion predicts optimal duration of treatment when stratified by extent of disease.\n8. Describe the relationship between the duration of the experimental regimen and the proportion of participants with sustained cure at 104 weeks after randomization without treatment failure or relapse.\n9. Assess vital status at 132 weeks post randomization.\n\nDevelopment of a shorter, better-tolerated treatment regimen will greatly enhance the ability of TB control programs to treat the growing number of patients. The DRAMATIC Trial will employ an innovative and efficient new design to establish a robust, nontoxic MDR-TB treatment regimen and identify the minimal duration for which it needs to be administered. These results will speed the process of moving forward to a confirmatory phase 3 clinical trial and increase the likelihood that such a trial is successful.",

    "brief_summary": "The current study aims to empower local cadres in providing care for metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients in 2 provinces in Indonesia (Bali and Yogyakarta).",
    "detailed_description": "Most mBC patients in Indonesia stay at home until they have heavy physical symptoms and need hospitalizations. In this country, even in hospitalization, support from the family caregivers is greatly needed \\[1\\]. Family caregivers and the community have a significant role for patients with mBC.\n\nIn Indonesia, the support system from local neighbours and community has been implemented for some decades through the involvement of cadres. Health cadres are people from the village who are appointed by their community to train and enhance the community participation in order to empower community health in Indonesia \\[2\\]. Most of them are housewives who have enough capability (mentally and physically) to learn, have enough time, and willing to provide support for their community. This role is informal and voluntary-based \\[3\\].\n\n-Community support through the existence of cadre in Indonesia- Cadres in Indonesia are initiated by community health services (hereafter Pusat Kesehatan Masyarakat/Puskesmas) around the area. The selection and development of cadres involve the lowest level of local government in the area. Cadres need to have some essential characteristics to undertake their role. They should have empathy as well as good communication skills since one of their tasks is to deliver important health information and message to the community. They need to be able to connect with the community to develop a mutual understanding and be accepted \\[4\\]. Funding received from national and local government is allocated for cadres to subsidize the transportation and logistics expenses, but this does not cover the monthly wages \\[2\\].\n\nCadres play a fundamental role in tackling health care problems especially those that are related to psychosocial and cultural factors since they have enough information and knowledge about people and situations in their area. Health care professionals who work in Puskesmas usually cooperate with cadres to gather information related to health conditions in the area or to support local activities. Several roles of cadre have been identified. First, health cadres are responsible for educating and motivating patients and their family to access health care system. They are responsible for assisting patients to access health care facilities for early diagnosis or treatment. On a daily basis, cadres are expected to monitor patients' condition as well as do home visit. At last, it is expected that cadres are able to advocate for patients and their family in the relation to health care professionals \\[5, 6\\].\n\nCadres are initiated and developed by Puskesmas and working closely with integrated health service posts (hereafter Posyandu). Posyandu is a local health unit, under the coordination of Puskesmas, that aims to provide care for baby and infant. Their activities include baby weighting, providing vitamin and enhancing the nutritional status of babies and infants. During Posyandu, health care teams from Puskesmas and cadres are working together. To be able to be classified as active, a Posyandu needs to have at least five health cadres \\[2\\]. Currently, there are around 395.495 health cadres in Indonesia.\n\n-Challenges of cadre in Indonesia- In Indonesia, some challenges faced by cadres have been identified. The first is that the role of cadres in Indonesia is still limited. Mostly, their role is merely to provide care for infants and children. Since the number of mBC patients who stay at home is high, health cadres are frequently requested to provide care for this specific group. There have been several initiatives in Indonesia focused on expanding cadres' roles; however, most of the initiatives are focusing on screening and early detection of cancer \\[7-9\\]. Until now, there is no single adequate intervention in Indonesia to prepare cadres in Indonesia to support mBC patients and their family caregivers.\n\nThe second issue is that although cadres have some connections with Puskesmas, the breadth and depth of the connections are still limited and have an unclear structure. There is a need to open communication channels so that cadres are able to connect with health care professionals from Puskesmas and their role can be recognized by local health authorities. When needed, cadres would be better positioned to request for help or provide important information to Puskesmas in regards to mBC patients problems and needs.\n\nGiven the important role of cadres, the COMMUNICATED project aims to empower local cadres to provide care for metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients in in Indonesia.",

    "brief_summary": "Ventilated pediatric patients are frequently over-sedated and the majority suffer from delirium, a form of acute brain dysfunction that is an independent predictor of increased risk of dying, length of stay, and costs. Universally prescribed sedative medications-the GABA-ergic benzodiazepines-worsen this brain organ dysfunction and independently prolong duration of ventilation and ICU stay, and the available alternative sedation regimen using dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 agonist, has been shown to be superior to benzodiazepines in adults, and may mechanistically impact outcomes through positive effects on innate immunity, bacterial clearance, apoptosis, cognition and delirium. The mini-MENDS trial will compare dexmedetomidine and midazolam, and determine the best sedative medication to reduce delirium and improve duration of ventilation, and functional, psychiatric, and cognitive recovery in our most vulnerable patients-survivors of pediatric critical illness.",
    "detailed_description": "The need for mechanical ventilation (MV) following acute respiratory and myocardial failure is the leading cause of admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Over 90% of MV pediatric patients receive continuous sedation, most commonly with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist benzodiazepines. Recently, the investigators demonstrated that exposure to the benzodiazepine midazolam contributed to iatrogenic harm in pediatric patients-prolonging PICU length of stay and increasing the prevalence and duration of delirium. Delirium is prevalent in the PICU with rates of up to 30% in older children, over 50% in infants and toddlers, and up to 60-70% in those on MV. Delirium in children is a significant contributor to longer duration of MV, substantial consequential costs, prolonged ICU stay, and mortality. Adult studies have shown that an alternative sedation paradigm using dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 agonist, decreases the prevalence and duration of delirium, duration of MV, ICU length of stay, cost, and infection rates compared to benzodiazepine-based sedation. Furthermore, the FDA recently published warnings regarding the possible role of anesthetics, including benzodiazepines, on cognitive dysfunction in children. Dexmedetomidine has unique anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant characteristics that are appealing given the association between inflammation, and endothelial and blood-brain barrier (BBB) injury with prolonged delirium and worse cognitive impairment in adults. To this end, there has been no large pediatric cohort study to examine the relationship between sedative choice and exposure in the ICU (a much longer exposure) with cognitive impairment among pediatric survivors. The investigators, therefore, propose mini-MENDS (Maximizing Efficacy of Goal-Directed Sedation to Reduce Neurological Dysfunction in Mechanically Ventilated Infants and Children STUDY), in which the investigators will determine whether sedation of MV pediatric patients with an alpha-2 agonist (dexmedetomidine) versus a GABA-ergic benzodiazepine (midazolam) will decrease daily prevalence of delirium (Aim 1A) and duration of MV (Aim 1B), will be associated with better functional, psychiatric, and cognitive recovery (Aim 2), and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers of endothelial and blood brain barrier injury (Aim 3). To accomplish these aims, the investigators will randomize 372 pediatric patients on MV, aged 44 weeks post-menstrual age to 11 years, to receive goal-directed continuous sedation with either dexmedetomidine or midazolam for up to 10 days. Our primary outcome, daily prevalence of delirium, will be objectively measured by trained research nurses who are blinded to intervention arm. Screening for delirium will be completed using the Preschool or Pediatric Confusion Assessment Methods for the ICU (ps/pCAM-ICU), based on developmental age, twice daily for up to 14 days while in the PICU. Cognition, functional status, and parental/patient psychological health will be assessed at enrollment (baseline), hospital discharge (DC), and 6 months following ICU-DC during an in-person evaluation by the pediatric neuropsychiatry team. Blood will be collected on days 1, 3, and 5 post-randomization to measure cytokines, markers of endothelial and BBB injury, and for safety.",

Once they've grown bigger in one spot or spread to other parts of the body, they're harder to treat. This is called advanced or metastatic cancer.\n\nParticipants in this study must have breast cancer or gastric cancer. Participants must have tumors that have HER2 on them. This allows the cancer to grow more quickly or spread faster. There are few treatment options for patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that express HER2.\n\nThis clinical trial uses an experimental drug called disitamab vedotin (DV). Disitamab vedotin is a type of antibody drug conjugate or ADC. ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them.\n\nThis clinical trial uses a drug called tucatinib, which has been approved to treat cancer in the United States and some other countries. This drug is sold under the brand name TUKYSA\u00ae.\n\nThis study will test how safe and how well DV with tucatinib works for participants with solid tumors. This study will also test what side effects happen when participants take these drugs. A side effect is anything a drug does to the body besides treating the disease.",

The 2 dose levels identified in the dose escalation phase will be assessed in the optimization phase for both safety and efficacy in HER2-expressing LA/mBC and LA/mGC/GEJC. Once the safety and efficacy profile of disitamab vedotin plus tucatinib has been established and a disitamab vedotin dose with the optimum benefit/risk ratio has been determined the disitamab vedotin plus tucatinib combination therapy will be evaluated in an expansion phase with 4 expansion cohorts in subjects with HER2-low LA/mGC/GEJC, HER2+ LA/mGC/GEJC, HER2-low LA/mBC, and HER2+ LA/mBC.",

    "detailed_description": "Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) are tumors that lack the hormone receptors and the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). TNBC represents about 15% of all invasive breast cancers diagnosed in the United States each year. This aggressive breast cancer subtype has the lowest overall survival rate of all advanced breast cancers with median survival of 12-13 months. Due to the lack of expression of the hormone receptors and HER2,chemotherapy remains the current treatment for women with advanced TNBC.\n\nA subset of breast cancers have defects in homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair due to germline BRCA mutations, and these cases are often triple negative. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes are involved in DNA repair and are activated by DNA strand breaks. PARP function is particularly critical in tumors with BRCA1/2 mutations, making PARP inhibition a rationale therapeutic strategy.\n\nTwo PARP inhibitors, Talazoparib and Olaparib, were approved by the FDA in 2018 for patients who have advanced HER2 negative breast cancer and a germline BRCA 1/2 mutation. These approvals were based on results from the EMBRACA and OLYMPIAD trials, respectively, which both showed an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) versus physician choice chemotherapy.\n\nGedatolisib is an intravenously administered PI3K and mTOR inhibitor which has been shown to be safe in patients with metastatic breast cancer, either alone or in combination with oral therapies. Previous research has shown that PI3K inhibitors lower nucleotide pools required for DNA synthesis and S-phase progression. Additionally, inhibition of PI3K/mTOR could impede PI3K interaction with the homologous recombination complex, increasing dependency on PARP enzymes for DNA repair. Based on this data, the combination of a PI3K inhibitor and PARP inhibitor could potentially lead to a new, non-chemotherapy treatment option for TNBC with wild-type BRCA and improve the modest PFS seen with the PARP inhibitors as single agents in BRCA1/2 mutant advanced breast cancer. The hypothesis for this trial is that the gedatolisib will sensitize advanced TNBC or BRCA1/2 mutant breast cancers to PARP inhibition with talazoparib. This study is thus designed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of gedatolisib in combination with talazoparib and to evaluate the efficacy of this combination in advanced HER2 negative breast cancer that is triple negative or BRCA1/2 positive (mutated/deficient).",

These disorders cause inflammation that weakens the muscles that are important for movement and may also cause skin rash in people with DM.\n\nThis study is seeking participants who:\n\n* Are 18 years of age or older or minimum legal adult age as defined per local regulation, whichever is greater\n* Have active DM or active PM.\n* Are receiving a stable dose of 1 corticosteroid taken by mouth and/or 1 traditional immunosuppressant.\n\n  * Note: Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are medicines that help reduce inflammation and may signal to the immune system not to attack the body.\n\nDermatomyositis (DM) is a rare disease that causes muscle inflammation that results in muscle weakness and low muscle stamina. Patients with DM have a characteristic skin rash. Polymyositis (PM) is a rare disease that involves mainly muscle inflammation resulting in muscle weakness, that can sometimes be painful. Patients with DM and PM may have trouble going up the steps, walking or getting to a standing position.\n\nSome of the participants will receive the study medicine (PF-06823859) and some will receive placebo (which is similar to study medicine but contains no medicine in it).\n\nThe study medicine or placebo will be given as an intravenous (IV) infusion (directly into the veins), which takes about1 hour; every 4 weeks from Day 1 to Week 48 of the study. Both PF-06823859 and placebo and will be given at the study site.\n\nThe study will compare the experiences of people receiving study medication to those of the people who do not.

    "brief_summary": "Intro:\n\nSickle cell disease is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation of the \u03b2 hemoglobin called HbS, which causes red blood cell (RBC) abnormalities responsible for hemolysis, mainly intravascular, leading to chronic anemia. Intravascular hemolysis is responsible for severe inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.\n\nMaintaining hemoglobin in its oxygenated R-conformation is one of the strategies for inhibiting the polymerization of HbS. Previous experimental therapeutic approaches having this effect have been discontinued due to poor pharmaceutical properties or toxicity. Nevertheless, they proved the validity of the concept by demonstrating an increase in oxyhemoglobin and a decrease in biomarkers of hemolysis.\n\nVoxelotor binds to the \u03b1 chain of globin and maintains Hb in its R conformation, thereby inhibiting the polymerization of HbS while increasing the affinity of Hb for oxygen.\n\nBecause of its mechanism of action affecting anemia and hemolysis, Voxelotor is a promising treatment for the prevention and treatment of renal and cerebral arterial disease.\n\nHypothesis/Objective :\n\nInvestigator hypothesis is that the treatment by Voxelotor (GBT440) will improve intra vascular hemolysis and will increase the total mass of hemoglobin with beneficial effects on organ function.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to evaluate the biological activity of Voxelotor on the reduction of intra vascular hemolysis measured by plasma hemoglobin.\n\nThe secondary objectives of the study will aim at characterizing the effects of GBT 440 Voxelotor on:\n\n* Intra vascular hemolysis measured by plasma Heme\n* Total hemoglobin mass (MHb)\n* RBCs lifespan\n* Blood volumes (plasma volume (PV), red blood cell mass (RBCM), total blood volume (BV))\n* Blood viscosity\n* Cerebral perfusion\n* Cerebrovascular vaso-reactivity\n* Cognitive function (MoCA)\n* Six minute walk test\n* Renal perfusion and iron deposits in renal cortex\n* Measurement of Glomerular filtration rate Estimation of glomerular filtration rate (CKD/EPI equation)\n* Urine albumin/creatinine ratio\n* Ability to decrease or stop erythropoietin in patients under EPO treatment\n* Safety (VOC, ACS, Priapism) and tolerability of voxelotor\n* RBC properties\n\nMethod:\n\nThis is an open-label, single-arm, single-stage phase II trial in patients treated with Voxelotor 1500 mg daily for 48 weeks.

    "detailed_description": "This research study is designed to provide a better understanding of study drugs cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) and palbociclib when used in combination to treat patients with metastatic colon cancer.\n\nCetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) is an antibody designed to target a protein called Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). EGFR plays an important role in the growth and survival of colon cancer. Antibodies are proteins that are naturally produced by the immune system and circulate throughout your body to help protect you from disease caused by bacteria, viruses, cancer cells or any foreign or toxic substance. Antibodies work by sticking to and flagging or marking foreign cells or substances so that your body's immune defense system will recognize, attack and remove them. Antibodies help the body rid itself of disease. Antibodies can also be designed in the laboratory to stick to specific parts of cancer cells (or normal cells) to change or block the ways those cells function in your body and to produce a therapeutic anti-cancer effect. Cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) is an antibody drug approved by the FDA and is commonly used to treat your type of colon cancer.\n\nPalbociclib is an FDA-approved drug for patients with breast cancer. Palbociclib is not FDA-approved for the treatment of colon cancer, and is considered an investigational drug in this research study. Palbociclib targets a protein called CDK4/6 that is a critical part of the cell division and cell growth processes known as \"the cell cycle\". Laboratory studies have shown that palbociclib inhibits the cell cycle, slows or stops cell growth, and can cause cell death in cancer cells.\n\nThe combination of Cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) with palbociclib is not approved by the FDA for treating colon cancer and is considered investigational in this research study.\n\nYou are being asked to be in the study because your colon cancer has been found to contain the proteins KRAS, NRAS and BRAF that are normal (wild-type). These proteins play an important role in the growth and survival of colon cancer. This requirement is important because colon cancer with these characteristics has been shown to be more responsive to EGFR inhibitors such as cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae), one of the drugs used in this study that is also a standard treatment option for your type of cancer. Also, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) has been shown to stimulate cancer cell division, growth and survival by working together with KRAS, NRAS and BRAF to activate CDK4/6 and to support an accelerated cell cycle. This accelerated cell cycle allows the cancer cells to divide and grow faster than your normal cells but also can make them sensitive to the effects of CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, a cell-cycle inhibitor.\n\nTo participate in this study you also must meet one of the following requirements:\n\nA. You have not been treated with EGFR inhibitors such as cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) or panitumumab (Vectibix\u00ae).\n\nB. You were treated with anti-EGFR drugs such as cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) or panitumumab (Vectibix\u00ae) and experienced at least 4 months of response to treatment, and it has been at least 8-weeks since you were last treated with an anti-EGFR drug.\n\nThis will allow investigators to compare the anti-cancer effects of cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) combined with palbociclib in 2 different groups of cancer patients:\n\n1. Patients that have never received EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) or panitumumab (Vectibix\u00ae). This group will test whether resistance to the combination of cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) plus palbociclib develops in this type of cancer.\n2. Patients that have previously shown an anti-cancer response to EGFR inhibitors, such as cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) or panitumumab (Vectibix\u00ae), of four or more months, but then developed resistance. This group will test whether the combination of cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) plus palbociclib is more effective against this resistant type of cancer.\n\nFurthermore, laboratory studies have shown that the combination of EGFR and CDK inhibitors provide a stronger anti-cancer effect when used in combination than seen when each inhibitor is used alone. Thus, the reason researchers are using cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) and palbociclib in combination is to simultaneously target and inhibit multiple processes inside of the cancer cell that are critical to growth and survival of the tumor. With this combination strategy, researchers hope to improve upon existing anti-cancer therapies.",

The antibodies can be passed to the infant through the placenta of the mother.\n\nThe study will look at the safety, tolerability, and immune activity in mothers and their infants.\n\nThis study is seeking pregnant women who are:\n\n* Less than or equal to 49 years old and have HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus -\n* Receiving standard medical care during the pregnancy\n* Do not have syphilis (bacterial sexually transmitted disease), Hepatitis B Virus ((HBV) liver infection), Tuberculosis ((TB) bacterial lung infection).\n* Have been on stable (anti-retroviral) HIV treatment for more than or equal to 90 days.\n* agree to be present for all study visits, procedures, and blood draws.\n\nParticipants will either receive:\n\n* RSVpreF vaccine\n* A placebo. A placebo does not have any medicine it but looks just like the study vaccine.\n\nPregnant participants will be involved in the study from:\n\n* consent during their current pregnancy, and\n* for 6 months after delivery of their baby (around 10 months in total). Pregnant participants will have at least 5 planned visits in this study. Infant participants: All eligible babies born to enrolled mothers will be followed up from birth for up to 6 months. Infant participants will have at least 3 study visits, with some site visits allowed to happen via home visits or over the telephone.",

    "brief_summary": "POLAR is a phase III clinical trial, which will test the safety and efficacy of an investigational combination of drugs to learn whether the combination of drugs works for a specific cancer. Palbociclib (Ibrance\u00ae) is the name of the investigational agent, which is assessed together with standard anti-hormone therapy in this study. Palbociclib is used to treat patients with hormone receptor-positive / HER2-negative breast cancer which has spread beyond the original tumor and/or to other organs.\n\nDuring this study, anti-hormone therapy will consist of either a selective estrogen receptor modulator (such as tamoxifen) or an aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane) or fulvestrant (Faslodex\u00ae). Premenopausal women and men may also receive a drug called an LHRH (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone) agonist by injection.\n\nIt is standard of care for people with hormone receptor positive breast cancer to take anti-hormone therapy. The study doctor will determine the type of standard anti-hormone therapy that will be given during this trial.\n\nThe purpose of the POLAR study is to compare the effect of using 3 years of palbociclib in combination with standard anti-hormone therapy with standard anti-hormone therapy alone and to evaluate the time until the breast cancer returns, if it does return.",
    "detailed_description": "Local or regional recurrence of breast cancer after mastectomy or lumpectomy indicates a poor prognosis, and accompanies or precedes distant metastasis in a high proportion of patients. Patients with isolated locoregional recurrences (ILRR), without evidence of distant metastasis hold a substantial risk of developing subsequent distant metastasis, with 5-year survival probabilities ranging between 45% and 80% after locoregional recurrence. These outcomes show the powerful negative prognostic importance of ILRR events and the need for treatments beyond surgical removal of the ILRR.\n\nAdjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapies reduce the risk of relapse and death in patients with primary breast cancer. However, few data are available to inform the recommendation of systemic treatment for locoregional recurrence.\n\nThe International Breast Cancer Studies Group carried out the CALOR trial, Chemotherapy as Adjuvant for Locally Recurrent breast cancer (IBCSG 27-02 / BIG 1-02 / NSABP B-37), in collaboration with the Breast International Group (BIG) and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP), to establish whether chemotherapy improves the outcome of patients with ILRR. An updated, final analysis of CALOR after median follow-up of about 9 years was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in April 2018, which confirmed chemotherapy benefitted patients with resected ER-negative ILRR and did not support the use of chemotherapy for ER-positive ILRR.\n\nCALOR results strongly suggest that tailoring treatment according to the disease characteristics of the recurrent lesion, in this case ILRR, provides a better indication of the possible responsiveness to treatment than relying on the characteristics of the primary tumor.\n\nPalbociclib has been granted FDA approval in the U.S. for the treatment of HR-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer in combination with the hormonal treatments letrozole and fulvestrant given the unprecedented results in terms of efficacy of two pivotal clinical trials (PALOMA-2 and PALOMA-3). Palbociclib and other CDK4/6 inhibitors have also shown a good toxicity profile and therefore are ideal candidates for combination with hormonal therapy. CDK4/6 pathway activation is a well-known mechanism of resistance to endocrine therapy, indeed CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown activity in cellular models of acquired resistance to endocrine therapies.\n\nThe reason for prolonged duration of palbociclib in the adjuvant setting (2 years) comes from the evidence of preclinical studies where cell senescence was investigated as an appealing mechanism of cell death and was indeed observed in vitro after exposure of breast cancer cells and tumors to a combination of endocrine therapy and palbociclib. It is therefore hypothesized that the longer patients receive combined treatment with palbociclib and an antiestrogen, the more likely they may derive prolonged clinical benefit.\n\nBased on the results of the CALOR trial and on strong evidence of activity of the combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors and endocrine therapy, the hypothesis of the POLAR trial is that the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in combination with endocrine therapy may be active as adjuvant therapy in patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative resected isolated locoregional recurrence of breast cancer.",

A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an investigational drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further studies. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved sacituzumab govitecan as a treatment for any disease.\n\nThe FDA has not approved talazoparib for this specific disease, but it has been approved for other uses in breast cancer.\n\nSacituzumab govitecan is an antibody-drug conjugate which means it's made up of an antibody attached to an anticancer drug. An antibody is a protein normally made by the immune system (the system in the body that fights off diseases). Sacituzumab govitecan is believed to work by binding the antibody portion of the drug to the tumor(s) while the anticancer drug portion works to prevent the cancer cells from growing/spreading.\n\nTalazoparib belongs to a group of drugs called PARP inhibitors. PARP is a protein that is involved with repairing damaged DNA (the genetic material of cells). Talazoparib is believed to work by inhibiting (stopping) the PARP proteins from working in the cancer cells so that the cancer cannot fix its damaged DNA.\n\nThe investigators believe that the combination of sacituzumab govitecan and talazoparib may help stop the cancer from growing and spreading by administering an anticancer drug directly to the cancerous tumor(s) through sacituzumab govitecan and by stopping the cancer's cells from fixing its damaged DNA through talazoparib.",

Patients will have a week without chemotherapy at the end of Induction, although patients with Induction failure (MRD \u22655% disease) will proceed directly to consolidation.\n\nEarly Post Induction:\n\n* Consolidation will be given following completion of Remission Induction Therapy. Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenous (IV), cytarabine IV, inotuzumab IV, and dasatinib PO for patients with ABL-class fusion. Patients will have a week without chemotherapy at the end of Consolidation.\n* Blinatumomab 1 will be given for four weeks to all patients after recovery from Consolidation.\n* High-dose Methotrexate will be given IV every two weeks for four cycles. Patients will also receive an intrathecal chemotherapy treatment with each of the 2 week cycles and will take oral mercaptopurine continuously if tolerated.\n* Reinduction will consist of dexamethasone for 7 days in the first and third week, 3 weekly doses of vincristine IV, 1 dose of daunorubicin IV, 1 dose of calaspargase IV, intrathecal (IT) MHA one dose, and dasatinib PO daily (for patients with ABL-class fusion).\n* Interim includes mercaptopurine po daily for 6 weeks, dexamethasone for 1 week (5 days), daunorubicin and vincristine IV on day 1 of weeks 2 and 5, calaspargase IV on day 1 of weeks 1 and 4, IT MHA on day 1 of week 4 and dasatinib po daily for 6 weeks (for patients with ABL-class fusion). Patients will have a week without chemotherapy at the end of Interim Therapy. Patients with Down syndrome will not receive daunorubicin during this phase.\n* Reconsolidation will repeat therapy given in Consolidation but replace the investigational inotuzumab with traditional mercaptopurine.\n* Blinatumomab 2 will be given for four weeks to patients with elevated end of induction MRD and patients with Down syndrome after Reconsolidation.\n\nMaintenance therapy follows Reconsolidation or Blinatumomab 2 (for those patients receiving this therapy) and includes 8 pulses of dexamethasone and vincristine given every 4 weeks, weekly methotrexate, daily mercaptopurine, intrathecal therapy, and dasatinib (for patients with ABL-class fusions). Maintenance therapy lasts a total of 80 weeks.\n\nDuration of therapy is approximately 2\u00bc years.

    "detailed_description": "This clinical study is looking at whether a drug called crizotinib, which is used in some patients with lung cancer, is effective in a sub-type of breast cancer, called lobular breast cancer. As the majority of lobular breast cancers are oestrogen receptor positive (ER+ve), crizotinib will be combined with a second drug, fulvestrant, to try to block tumour growth that is driven by oestrogen.\n\nCrizotinib targets cancers with genetic changes in two genes called ALK and ROS1. Lung cancers with changes in these genes usually get smaller when treated with crizotinib. Laboratory work at the Institute of Cancer Research has shown that lobular breast cancer cells, due to a mutation in a different gene called CDH1, appear to be similarly affected by crizotinib.\n\nFulvestrant is an oestrogen receptor down regulator and blocks the effects of oestrogen on oestrogen receptor positive (ER+ve) breast cancer cells. Fulvestrant is an established and approved anti-hormone therapy which patients with breast cancers are receiving in the clinic. It is possible that the combination of crizotinib and an anti-oestrogen agent will shrink the tumour(s) more effectively and prevent further growth. Because fulvestrant is only effective in post-menopausal women, if participants have not yet gone through the menopause, participants will need to start (or continue to receive) a monthly injection under the skin to temporarily stop the function of the participants ovaries to be eligible to take part in the trial.\n\nThis injection is called goserelin and has to be started at least 4 weeks before the first day of treatment on the trial.\n\nThe overall aims of this clinical study are to find out:\n\n* The proportion of patients whose tumour(s) shrink when they are treated with crizotinib and fulvestrant\n* The safety and tolerability of fulvestrant in combination with crizotinib, to determine that they can be given together without unacceptable side effects\n* What the drugs do to the tumours, which will help us decide which patients may benefit from this combination in the future",

Lastly, children aged 1 to 5 years will be permitted to enroll.\n\nThis study will enroll participants who:\n\n* have severe Hemophilia A or moderately severe to severe Hemophilia B (with or without inhibitors)\n* have accurate historical records documenting all factor VIII, factor IX, or bypass agent infusions and hemophilia bleed events for at least 1 year prior to entering the study\n* if a non-inhibitor patient, must be on a stable routine prophylaxis regimen with factor VIII or factor IX replacement products for at least 12 months prior to study entry\n* if an inhibitor patient, must be on an on-demand bypass treatment regimen during the 12 months prior to study entry\n\nAll participants in this study will receive marstacimab to use prophylactically. Marstacimab will be given once a week as a subcutaneous (under the skin) shot. The first dose of marstacimab will be given at the study site by the study site staff. During the 12-month treatment period, weekly doses of marstacimab can be given at home, or if preferred, the doses may be given by the study site staff.\n\nTo help us determine if the study medicine is safe and effective, we will compare participant experiences when they are taking the study medicine to a historical period when they were not. Researchers want to see if the study medicine works to prevent the bleeding episodes commonly experienced by patients with Hemophilia.\n\nParticipants will be in this study for about 14 months (approximately 1 month in a Screening period, 12 months receiving treatment, and 1 month in a follow-up period) during which they will visit the study site at least 10 times. If preferred, and if local regulations allow it, 2 of the study visits can be completed at the participant's home instead of at the study site. There will also be 6 scheduled telephone calls approximately every 2 months.",

It will compare two induction chemotherapy regimens: mitoxantrone and cytarabine (current standard treatment) with liposomal daunorubicin and cytarabine. This will test liposomal daunorubicin, which is believed to be less cardiotoxic than similar conventional drugs, although this is unproven. (Randomisation 1 (R1) closed early to recruitment on 8th September 2017, due to liposomal daunorubicin manufacturing issues resulting in unavailability of the drug.)\n\nPatients responding well to induction chemotherapy are eligible for a randomisation of two consolidation regimens: high dose cytarabine (current standard treatment) or fludarabine and cytarabine (FLA)\u037e a regimen commonly used in patients with relapsed disease, testing whether FLA is more effective in front line therapy than standard consolidation treatment. Patients with cytogenetic features associated with a higher risk of relapse and those responding sub-optimally to induction treatment are candidates for haemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and are eligible for a randomisation comparing two HSCT conditioning regimens: myeloablative conditioning (MAC) (current UNited Kingdom (UK) standard) or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). HSCT has not consistently shown benefit in high risk patients because the mortality associated with the procedure has outweighed the advantage from a reduction in relapse risk. This will test whether reducing the intensity of conditioning improves survival by reducing transplant related deaths without increasing the relapse rate. The trial incorporates a dose finding study for gemtuzumab ozogamicin. The aim is to identify the optimum tolerated number of doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (up to a total of 3 doses), which can be safely combined with either of the induction chemotherapy regimens and then to compare this number of doses with one dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. The intensity of treatment will be directed by cytogenetics/molecular genetics and response assessed by minimal residual disease (MRD) levels measured by flow cytometry and molecular methodology.",

After one defibrillation and when feasible, paramedics will establish peripheral intravenous (IV) access, and patients will be randomly allocated to either the low dose or standard dose treatment arm. Epinephrine doses (according to treatment assignment) will be administered every 3-5 minutes, based on current guidelines and paramedic protocols, until the first return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is achieved or if resuscitation has been terminated by the base hospital physician. Other medications (e.g. antiarrhythmics, magnesium, beta blockers) and interventions (e.g. intubation) may be interposed as required. Follow-up will take place using a combination of administrative databases (e.g. the Discharge Abstract Database and the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System) and telephone interviews.\n\nThis RCT will evaluate a fundamental change in the treatment of OHCA.

    "brief_summary": "This phase III/IV trial compares the impact of leuprolide and abiraterone acetate (AA) versus relugolix and AA on the heart in hormone-naive patients with advanced prostate cancer receiving pelvic radiation therapy. Leuprolide is in a class of medications called gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GNRHa). It prevents the body from making luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). This causes the testicles to stop making testosterone (a male hormone) in men and may stop the growth of prostate tumor cells that need testosterone to grow. Abiraterone acetate, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, works by decreasing the amount of certain hormones in the body. Relugolix, a GNRH antagonist, works by decreasing the amount of testosterone produced by the body. This may slow or stop the spread of prostate tumor cells that need testosterone to grow. The use of hormone therapy with radiation therapy has been shown to improve survival, however, studies have suggested that the addition of hormone therapy may worsen heart (cardiac) disease and high blood pressure. In fact, studies have shown that the most common cause of death in prostate cancer patients is due to heart disease or heart attacks. Computed tomography (CT) scans create a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body; the pictures are created by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. In this study, sophisticated cardiac CT images are used to take pictures of patients' heart and coronary arteries to help assess damage to the heart. Using cardiac CT and blood tests, this trial may help doctors determine which patients are at risk of cardiac disease when treated with combination hormone therapy, as well as the differential risk of leuprolide versus relugolix in combination with abiraterone acetate.",
    "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Measure cardiovascular outcomes between combination gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GNRHa, i.e. leuprolide) plus abiraterone acetate (AA) versus gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist (GNRH-antagonist, i.e. relugolix) plus AA in men with advanced prostate cancer receiving definitive radiation therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Identify genomic alterations that predispose an individual to enhanced cardiovascular (CV) toxicity following hormone therapy with leuprolide or relugolix in combination with abiraterone acetate.\n\nII. Evaluate serum testosterone kinetics during and after treatment with combination leuprolide+AA versus relugolix+AA.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive leuprolide intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC) injection every 3 to 6 months plus oral AA with prednisone daily for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo standard of care radiation therapy. Patients may also receive bicalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 21-30 with first injection of leuprolide at the discretion of the treating provider. All patients undergo pre-treatment and 12-month coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and blood sample collection.\n\nARM II: Patients receive oral relugolix PO daily plus oral AA with prednisone daily for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo standard of care radiation therapy.

The trial will test 2 combinations of therapy and participants will be randomly assigned to either Arm A or Arm B. The purpose of the phase I study is to determine the highest tolerable doses of the combinations of treatment given in each Arm.\n\nIn Arm A, children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors will receive 2 medications called Onivyde and talazoparib. Onivyde works by damaging the DNA of the cancer cell and talazoparib works by blocking the repair of the DNA once the cancer cell is damaged. By damaging the tumor DNA and blocking the repair, the cancer cells may die. In Arm B, children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors will receive 2 medications called Onivyde and temozolomide. Both of these medications work by damaging the DNA of the cancer call which may cause the tumor(s) to die.\n\nOnce the highest doses are reached in Arm A and Arm B, then \"expansion Arms\" will open. An expansion arm treats more children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors at the highest doses achieved in the phase I study. The goal of the expansion arms is to see if the tumors go away in children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. There will be 3 \"expansion Arms\". In Arm A1, children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors (excluding Ewing sarcoma) will receive Onivyde and talazoparib. In Arm A2, children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, whose tumors have a problem with repairing DNA (identified by their doctor), will receive Onivyde and talazoparib. In Arm B1, children and AYAs with recurrent or refractory solid tumors (excluding Ewing sarcoma) will receive Onivyde and temozolomide.\n\nOnce the highest doses of medications used in Arm A and Arm B are determined, then a phase II study will open for children or young adults with Ewing sarcoma that has recurred or is refractory following treatment received after the initial diagnosis.

A dose finding phase I study will be open to patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. Patients will be assigned to receive either ONI plus TAL (Arm A) or ONI plus TMZ (Arm B). Once the recommended phase II doses (RP2D) of Arm A and Arm B are determined, expansion cohorts (A1, B1) will open at the RP2Ds for enrollment of non-Ewing sarcoma solid tumor patients. There will be an additional Arm A expansion cohort (A2) for patients with homologous recombination repair defects. Concurrently, the phase II study will open to patients with RR Ewing sarcoma. In the phase II study, patients with RR Ewing sarcoma will be randomized to receive either ONI plus TAL or ONI plus TMZ. The primary endpoint will be progression-free survival (PFS).

Arm A will evaluate Onivyde plus talazoparib (ONI + TAL). Arm B will evaluate Onivyde plus temozolomide (ONI + TMZ). Both phase I studies will be open to patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors who meet eligibility criteria. In Arm A, patients will receive intravenous Onivyde on Days 1 and 8. They will receive oral talazoparib twice on Day 1 and then daily on Days 2-6. In Arm B, patients will receive intravenous Onivyde on Days 1 and 8. They will receive oral temozolomide daily on Days 1-5. Pharmacokinetic testing will take place during Cycle 1. Therapy may continue for up to 24 months. Tumor assessments will be performed at baseline and repeated after cycles 2, 4, 6 and then every 4 cycles thereafter to assess disease status. If at any designated disease evaluation time point a patient develops a response that is better than the prior response (i.e. SD at Cycle 2 evaluation, then PR at Cycle 4 evaluation), an interim disease evaluation is recommended after 28 days to confirm response. Therapy will be discontinued if there is evidence of disease progression or drug-related dose limiting toxicities requiring removal from treatment.

Safety and tolerability will be monitored continuously throughout study participation.\n\nSample size: In the dose escalation phase I study, approximately 18 patients per arm will be enrolled for a total of 36 patients. The dose expansion phase I study will include 3 treatment cohorts. Arm A will have 2 dose expansion cohorts including 1) a non-ES solid tumor cohort (A1) and 2) a DNA repair defects/mutations cohort (A2). Arm B will have 1 dose expansion cohort including non-ES solid tumors (B1). Approximately 12 patients will enroll per expansion treatment cohort for a total of 36 patients. In the phase II study, 44 patients will be enrolled on each arm for a total of 88 patients.",

The investigators have developed a deep learning model that identifies patients with features of ATTR-CA and other types of cardiac amyloidosis using echocardiographic, ECG, and clinical factors. By applying this model to the population served by NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, the investigators will identify a list of patients at highest predicted risk for having undiagnosed cardiac amyloidosis. The investigators will then invite these patients for further testing to diagnose cardiac amyloidosis. The rate of cardiac amyloidosis diagnosis of patients in this study will be compared to rate of cardiac amyloidosis diagnosis in historic controls from the following two groups: (1) patients referred for clinical cardiac amyloidosis testing at NewYork-Prebysterian Hospital and (2) patients enrolled in the Screening for Cardiac Amyloidosis With Nuclear Imaging in Minority Populations (SCAN-MP) study.",

One cause of heart failure is transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA), in which misfolded proteins deposit into the heart. This condition is often diagnosed very late when patients have severe symptoms. In this study, the investigators are trying to use a computer algorithm to find patients with cardiac amyloidosis that has not been diagnosed or suspected by their doctors. The investigators will look at patients seen at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and use our algorithm to identify 100 patients with a high probability of having cardiac amyloidosis and bring them in to be tested.\n\n* ATTR-CA diagnosis: A diagnosis of ATTR-CA will be made according to consensus guidelines by an amyloidosis expert. These criteria include either (1) imaging criteria with requires that a patient's cardiac amyloid scintigraphy single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan shows myocardial uptake, increase left ventricular (LV) wall thickness by cardiac imaging that is unexplained by loading conditions, and follow-up monoclonal protein testing shows no evidence of clinical amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis or (2) pathologic criteria with a biopsy showing systemic transthyretin deposition.\n* Cardiac amyloidosis (AL-CA) diagnosis: A clinical diagnosis of AL-CA will be by an amyloidosis expert according to society guidelines. These includes a diagnosis made in one of the following settings: (1) cardiac biopsy showing AL deposition and (2) extra-cardiac biopsy showing AL deposition with typical cardiac features on imaging such as echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.",

Advanced MRI methodology enables the assessment of various uterine parameters, including contractions, peristalsis, perfusion, blood oxygenation, and structural factors. Importantly, it is possible to temporally correlate these mechanisms with self-reported spontaneous menstrual cramping pain through real-time imaging.\n\nIn the first aim of this proposal (Aim #1), mechanisms underlying unexplained menstrual pain phenotypes linked to deficiencies in myometrial activity, perfusion, and oxygenation and evaluate the subsequent impact of REL-CT will be evaluated. Aim #2 focuses on characterizing unexplained menstrual pain phenotypes associated with impairments in the central nervous system sensory functions and the effects of REL-CT. Quantitative sensory testing methods will be used to comprehensively assesses peripheral, central ascending, central integrating, and central descending nervous system components related to pelvic pain. In the past, this testing can identify central nervous system component pain that predicts the pain trajectory and corresponds with treatment outcomes.\n\nBy analyzing the relationship between the variable effectiveness of REL-CT treatment to observed mechanisms in menstrual pain, it may possible to identify specific unexplained pelvic pain phenotypes amenable to medical management. Furthermore, because that the precise mechanisms by which REL-CT alleviates menstrual pain in endometriosis remain incompletely understood, a cohort of endometriosis patients will be also studied. The overarching objective is to uncover the underlying mechanisms that advance the comprehension of menstrual pain biology and establish these mechanisms as phenotypic markers for treating REL-CT.",

This study will also test if there is a difference in the safety and immune effects of the new pneumococcal vaccine when it is one type of solution compared to when it is in a different type of solution.\n\nThe immune response is how the body's cells; tissues and organs work together to protect the body from infection. Blood samples will be used to measure the amount of antibodies produced after the vaccination. Antibodies are proteins that protect you when an unwanted germ enters the body. This will help understand how well the new pneumococcal vaccine works. This vaccine can possibly provide protection against pneumococcal disease. Pneumococcal disease includes a variety of infections caused by a specific germ, Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\nThis study is seeking participants who are:\n\n* male or female infants who are 2 months of age,\n* infants born at 36 weeks (about 8 and a half months) of pregnancy or later; and,\n* said to be healthy by the study doctor\n\nThere are four groups in this study. All participants will be assigned to one of the four groups. All study vaccines will be given as a single shot into the left thigh muscle. Participants in the three groups will have 3 blood samples collected during the 1 and a half years they are in the study.\n\nThe first 400 participants who enter the study will be assigned to either Group 1 or Group 2. Half the participants in Group 1 and half the participants in Group 2 will receive 4 doses at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age of PG4 mixed in the first solution. The other half of the participants in Groups 1 and 2 will receive 4 doses of 20vPnC (Prevnar 20\u00ae) at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age. The main difference between Groups 1 and 2 is that participants in Group 2 will have the first blood sample collected at an earlier time than those in Group 1.\n\nOnce 400 participants have been assigned to Groups 1 and 2 then 100 new participants will be assigned to Group 3. Half the participants in Group 3 will receive PG4 in the second solution at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age. The other half of the participants in Groups 3 will receive 4 doses of 20vPnC (Prevnar 20\u00ae) at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age.\n\nOnce the 100 participants have been assigned to Group 3 then 300 new participants will be assigned to Group 4. Half the participants in Group 4 will receive PG4 in the first solution at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age. The other half of the participants in Group 4 will receive 4 doses of a licensed pneumococcal comparator vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age.\n\nParticipants will take part in this study for about 16 to 19 months (about 1 and a half years). During this time, participants will have 6 study clinic visits and 1 to 2 phone calls. At these study clinic visits, parent(s) or legal guardian(s) will be asked if the participant experienced any side effects. A side effect is an unintentional or unexpected reaction to a vaccine.",

A total of 48 participants will be enrolled in 4 age cohorts of 12 each, 6 Part A and 6 Part B. Part A will begin enrolling before Part B and no infant may participate in both parts. Cohort 1 will include full term infants age \u226513 weeks to \\<39 weeks and preterm infants postmenstrual age \u226550 weeks to \\<75 weeks. Cohort 2 will include full term infants age \u226528 weeks to \\<13 weeks and preterm infants postmenstrual age \u226540 weeks to \\<50 weeks and \u226528 days of age. Cohort 3 will include full term infants age birth to \\<28 days. Cohort 4 will include preterm infants age birth to \\<28 days or postmenstrual age \\<40 weeks.\n\nParticipants in Part A must be hospitalized and receiving intravenous antibiotic treatment for a suspected or confirmed bacterial infection. Participants will receive a single 3 hour intravenous infusion of ATM-AVI and have 3 ATM-AVI blood level assessments during and up to 5 hour after the infusion. Participants will be observed for 48 hours following the infusion to assess safety and toleration and will have a final follow-up safety assessment which may be conducted by telephone 4-5 weeks following the infusion. The single infusion of ATM-AVI is administered to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of ATM-AVI and is not intended as treatment for the bacterial infection. The total duration of study participation in Part A is expected to be 5 weeks through the end of the final safety follow-up.\n\nParticipants in Part B must be hospitalized with suspected or confirmed aerobic gram-negative bacterial infection requiring intravenous antibacterial therapy. Part B participants will receive multiple 3 hour intravenous infusions of ATM-AVI every 6 hour (8 hours for preterm infants) for 3-14 days as treatment for their bacterial infection and to assess ATM-AVI pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy. Participants with complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) will also receive intravenous metronidazole and all participants will have the option to receive other intravenous antibiotic treatment for gram-positive bacteria, as appropriate. Participants who have a good clinical response after 72 hours of intravenous ATM-AVI treatment may be switched to a different orally administered antibiotic, if clinically appropriate. Part B participants will have a total of 5 ATM-AVI blood level assessments over the first 2 or more days following the start of ATM-AVI infusions and will have their clinical response assessed at the End of Treatment (intravenous and oral, if applicable), and at a Test-of-Cure (TOC) evaluation 7 to 14 days after the last antibiotic treatment (intravenous or oral). A final safety assessment which may be conducted by telephone will occur 4-5 weeks after the last dose of ATM-AVI. The total duration of study participation in Part B is expected to be up to 7 weeks through the end of the final safety follow-up.\n\nAdditional safety monitoring will be provided by an independent external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). Enrollment for the study will begin with Part A, single dose, cohorts 1-3. Part A Cohort 4 (preterm neonates) will commence enrollment after sponsor and DMC review of plasma drug levels and safety for a least 2 participants in Part A Cohort 3 and review of ATM-AVI safety and tolerability for all participants enrolled at that time. Enrollment in the multidose Part B cohorts will be delayed until preliminary information is obtained regarding ATM-AVI multidose safety, tolerability, and drug levels for the participants 9 months to 2 years of age in the separate ongoing ATM-AVI pediatric study C3601008 \\[NCT05639647\\].",

Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the intervention is being studied.\n\nThe study will be conducted in two independent cohorts. The first cohort (Cohort 1) is comprised of participants with measurable CNS metastases from solid tumors (including patients whose primary cancers are from lung, breast or melanoma) harboring specific alterations, and participants receive the study drug palbociclib. The second cohort (Cohort 2) will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of pembrolizumab and palbociclib in recurrent brain metastases from breast cancer.\n\nPalbociclib is being studied for use in the treatment of a broad range of cancers. This type of drug inhibits cell growth in the cells called cyclin-dependent kinases which promote tumor cell proliferation. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved palbociclib for participants with central nervous system metastases, but it has been approved for other uses.\n\nResearchers hope to study the effects of pembrolizumab. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved pembrolizumab for some diseases, but not central nervous system metastases. Many cancers use specific pathways (such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4) to evade the body's immune system. Pembrolizumab works by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathways and thus releasing the brakes on the immune system so it can stop or slow cancer. In some tumor diagnoses, there may be a correlation between a specific marker (PD-L1 status) and activity of types of immunotherapies.\n\nParticipants in any cohort will receive study treatment as long as they do not experience intolerable side effects and their disease does not worsen, and will be followed for 2 years after their study treatment ends.",

The immune system sends a type of cells called T cells throughout the body to detect and fight infections and diseases-including cancers. One way the immune system controls the activity of T cells is through the PD-1 (programmed cell death protein-1) pathway. However, some cancer cells hide from T-cell attack by taking control of the PD-1 pathway and this stops T cells from attacking cancer cells. Avelumab is a type of drug, known as an antibody which is designed to block the PD-1 pathway and helps the immune system in detecting and fighting cancer cells. An antibody is a protein produced by the body's immune system when it detects harmful substances. Previous studies show that the administration of antibodies which block the PD-1 pathway can lead to tumor destruction.\n\nUtomilumab is an antibody designed to stimulate the body's immune system to fight cancer cells. Previous studies have shown that the administration of this type of antibody may help to prevent tumors from growing.\n\nIn the laboratory, adding avelumab and Utomilumab to trastuzumab appears to improve effectiveness. It is not known whether this is true in humans.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are evaluating the activity of 3 different combinations: (a)trastuzumab and vinorelbine combined, (b) trastuzumab, vinorelbine and avelumab combined, and (c) trastuzumab, vinorelbine, avelumab and utomilumab combined in participants with metastatic HER2- positive breast cancer.",

    "detailed_description": "This is a phase Ib study designed to confirm the safety and evaluate the efficacy of palbociclib combined with avelumab in AR positive TNBC. It is a multi-centre study design (it will run at several hospitals in the UK).\n\nPalbociclib inhibits two proteins involved in cell growth called cyclin dependent kinase 4 and cyclin dependent kinase 6 (CDK4/6). Inhibiting CDK4/6 stops cells, such as cancer cells, from dividing and multiplying further. Palbociclib is currently approved for the treatment of metastatic HR positive HER2 negative breast cancer, based on good results from large clinical trials. Laboratory studies have shown that palbociclib might be also useful in some patients with triple negative breast cancer, an aggressive subtype of breast cancer that does not express the hormone receptors or HER2 receptor, but only if the cancer is positive for the androgen-receptor (AR).\n\nAvelumab is an immunotherapy drug which does not destroy cancer cells, but tries to stimulate the body's immune system to do this. Avelumab has been tested in a number of different types of tumours including breast cancer, but although approved for use in the USA, it is not currently an approved standard treatment in the UK. The combination of both drugs has never been tested in humans before.\n\nRecruitment to Part A will be conducted only at the Royal Marsden Hospital and Part A of the study will establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and optimal schedule of the combination in any suitable patients with advanced breast cancer. Once this dose schedule has been confirmed, the chosen dose level will be recruited to, aiming to include 27 patients with AR positive TNBC (Part B).Part B will recruit at up to 8 high volume centres. The androgen receptor is not routinely tested for in hospital laboratories, so patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer who are interested in taking part in the study will be asked to provide consent for previously taken cancer samples/biopsies to be sent to the Royal Marsden for testing, to see if the cancer expresses the androgen receptor, which would make participants potentially eligible for part B of the study. Approximately 20% of triple negative breast cancers express AR. This phase of the study will include important translational work using new cancer samples (biopsies) and blood samples to investigate potential \"biomarkers\" -predictors of efficacy and resistance to the combination.\n\nIn Part A of the study, patients with previously treated, advanced breast cancer will have an ECG (heart trace) a CT scan of the body and potentially an MRI scan of the brain and a bone scan (depending upon where the breast cancer is known to have spread to) as well as blood tests to determine if participants are suitable for the study.\n\nDuring the study participants will receive daily palbociclib tablets and intravenous infusions of avelumab every two weeks. Participants will be monitored with regular blood tests and repeat CT scans every 8 weeks. At whatever time point the treatment stops working, the patient will stop treatment and will be asked to have further blood tests one month later as well as a check up with the study doctor.\n\nIn Part B of the study, patients with triple negative histology and positive androgen receptor status tested at the Royal Marsden will be required to have a cancer biopsy before participants start treatment on the study.

It is not currently approved for treating your disease.\n\nTalazoparib is a drug that stops the activity of a protein called poly (adenosine diphosphate \\[ADP\\]-ribose) polymerase or PARP. PARP is involved in repairing damage to the DNA within your cells. DNA is the set of instructions found within all of your cells that tells them how to behave. The DNA is damaged all the time by things around in the environment, and is repaired by several different methods, one of which uses PARP. When PARP is turned off by Talazoparib in the normal cells, other methods can still work to repair damage to DNA. However, in some cancer cells these other methods are broken and cannot be used. When PARP is turned off by Talazoparib in these cancer cells, DNA damage cannot be repaired and leads to the death of the cancer cells. Talazoparib is a drug that is safe and active in breast cancer and gynecologic cancers. However, there were no responses among 33 unselected patients with hematologic malignancies, including 21 with AML (acute myeloid leukemia) and 4 with MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome), when they received treatment with Talazoparib by itself. It is not known if there were any patients with cohesin-mutations that were on the clinical trial (these mutations are rare).\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are testing if Talazoparib is an effective treatment for patients with AML and MDS that have a mutation in the cohesin complex. The cohesin complex is made up of a group of proteins that are critical for normal DNA replication activity. Mutations in the cohesin complex occur in patients with MDS/AML and may represent a new therapeutic target. In a chemical screen experiment in a Dana-Farber Cancer Institute laboratory, the investigators found that leukemia cells featuring a mutated cohesin complex were sensitive to Talazoparib (meaning the leukemia cells went away after treatment with Talazoparib) by a mechanism called synthetic lethality (this means that the lab experiments showed that leukemia cells with a mutation in cohesin were dependent on PARP activity to survive; when inhibiting PARP with a PARP inhibitor like Talazoparib, the leukemia cells died). The investigators thus identified Talazoparib to be a possible treatment for actual patients with MDS or AML that have a mutation in cohesin complex.",

    "brief_summary": "This is a prospective, non-randomized clinical trial that aims to describe the efficacy and toxicity of commercially available, targeted anticancer drugs\\* prescribed for treatment of patients with advanced cancer with a potentially actionable variant as revealed by a genomic or protein expression test. The study also aims to simplify patient access to approved targeted therapies that are contributed to the program by collaborating pharmaceutical companies and to perform next generation sequencing on tumor biopsies for biomarker analyses. Eligible patients have an advanced solid tumor, multiple myeloma or B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma for which standard treatment options are no longer available and acceptable performance status and organ function. A genomic or protein expression test must have been performed on the tumor and the results must identify at least one potentially actionable molecular variant as defined in the protocol. Results from the molecular profiling test will be used to determine an appropriate drug(s) from among those available in the protocol. The choice of drug will be supported by a list of potential profiles, a molecular tumor board, a knowledge library and by study coordinators for review and approval of the match. The protocol-specified treatment will be administered to the patient once any drug-specific eligibility criteria are confirmed and a fresh pre-treatment biopsy is performed for future genetic studies. All patients who receive treatment with a drug available in the protocol will be followed for standard efficacy outcomes including tumor response, progression-free and overall survival as well as duration of treatment. In addition, treatment related toxicity will be evaluated.",
    "detailed_description": "Problem description: evidence is building that matching targeted agents to tumor characteristics can improve outcomes. Such reports have fueled interest among patients and physicians to use molecular testing for treatment planning when standard treatment options have been exhausted. When oncologists aim to provide such personalized treatment to their patients though, obtaining the drugs can be challenging since off-label prescribing, while legal, is generally not reimbursed by insurance companies. Furthermore, outcomes of off-label treatment in routine clinical practice are not systematically recorded. As a result, the research and clinical communities have limited insight in these outcomes, leading to repetitive use of ineffective treatment for some tumor types, while effective treatment strategies might be missed for others. The latter is especially relevant for 'orphan diseases', that are too rare to conduct formal phase II and III trials. In summary, there is a lack of access to potentially effective therapy on one hand, and a lack of knowledge on broader use of such therapies on the other, altogether leading to sub-optimal use of available resources.\n\nEnvisioned solution and study aim: creation of a drug-access program, in which patients are treated with registered targeted therapy matched to their molecular tumor profile, and in which the outcomes of such therapies are recorded systematically, per tumor profile and tumor type (this is important since it is becoming increasingly clear that the tissue of origin is an important determinant of outcome of genetic abnormalities). We hereby aim to improve and broaden the use of registered targeted therapy, whilst facilitating patient access to such therapy.\n\nPlan of investigation: patients will be treated with approved targeted agents, selected based on results of a molecular profiling test of the patient's tumor. Eligible patients will have exhausted standard treatment options, and their tumor must harbor a potentially actionable molecular variant as defined in the protocol. The study will provide a tumor board to help physicians understand the profiling test results and treatment options, and will enable insights about the utility of this approach. In addition, next generation sequencing will be performed on fresh tumor biopsies for additional biomarker discovery. Patients from the Netherlands and the USA will be included in two similar though independent protocols (DRUP and TAPUR), allowing data-exchange and empowering of both trials.\n\nExpected outcome: early signs of clinical activity of approved drugs outside their label, providing effective personalized treatment options, improved patient outcomes and access to targeted therapy.",

    "brief_summary": "Approximately 3.5% to 6% of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients are stage IV metastatic. De novo metastatic breast cancer accounts for 20% to 25% of these cases. Despite a decrease in mortality in Europe and North America due to early detection and access to treatment, breast cancer remains the 2\u207f\u1d48 leading cause of cancer deaths in developed countries after lung cancer and the world's leading cause.\n\nIn the ESME French national retrospective cohort (NCT03275311), the newly diagnosed estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and HER2-negative (luminal) metastatic patients had a 59.1 months overall survival (OS) for pre-menopausal women and 44.7 months for postmenopausal women. In the same cohort, the median OS was 47.4 months for de novo metastatic patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive / HER2-negative breast cancer.\n\nThe most important current treatment for metastatic breast cancer remains systemic therapy. Surgery and radiation are mainly used to treat symptoms. However, more than 15 retrospective studies have assessed the impact of locoregional treatment on relapse and OS. These studies suggested an improvement of the OS in patients with de novo metastatic breast cancer thanks to the addition of locoregional treatment to systemic therapy. Recent data from the ESME cohort suggest that patients with de novo luminal or HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer may benefit from local treatment of the primary tumor.\n\nSeveral prospective trials have attempted to demonstrate the benefit of locoregional treatment with mixed results. This can be explained by a limited power of statistical analysis, on the recruitment of patients with breast cancer of all types, and on a limited access to effective systemic therapies in some cases and all before the area of anti CD4/6 which is the current standard treatment in patients with HR-positive / HER2-negative luminal metastatic disease.\n\nHowever, guidelines indicate that a \"multimodal approach, including curative locoregional treatments, should be considered\". As a result, many clinicians offer locoregional treatment of the primary tumor, especially if there is a good response to the first line of systematic treatment.\n\nTaken together, these data underscore the need for an evaluation of the value of combined therapy - endocrine therapy - CDK4/6 inhibitor and locoregional treatment - in this population of patients with newly diagnosed HR-positive / HER2-negative breast cancer.",

Rel-CT is an FDA approved form of medical treatment for endometriosis. It is known to work in treating endometriosis pain. However, investigators do not know whether or not there is a benefit to beginning Rel-CT immediately following surgery. This study will test if patients who take Rel-CT after surgery have better quality of life and less chance the endometriosis comes back, requiring additional surgery.\n\nThe main question it aims to answer is:\n\n- Does taking Rel-CT following excisional surgery for endometriosis result in higher Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP-30) scores, indicating a positive impact on overall health-related quality of life and well-being?\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. One treatment group will take study drug Rel-CT after having excisional surgery, and the other treatment group will just have the surgery alone.\n* Be asked to complete questionnaires, called the Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP-30) at 4 timepoints. The first time is before surgery, then at follow-up visits at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. The survey has 30 questions that ask about pain, control, powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image.\n\nResearchers will compare the two treatment groups (Rel-CT and non Rel-CT) to see if there is a change in EHP-30 scores.",
    "detailed_description": "The design of this study will be an unblinded randomized controlled trial of medical suppression with once daily Relugolix combination therapy (Rel-CT) following excisional surgery for endometriosis performed by high volume minimally invasive gynecologic surgeons. Women over the age of 18 scheduled to undergo a laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis will be screened and if agree and consented to participate will be randomized to either Rel-CT following surgery or no post-operative hormonal suppression using a block randomization with blocks 2 and 4. The surgeon will not have access to the randomization schedule to reduce selection bias. Inclusion criteria will include: 1) Patients over the age of 18 planning to undergo an elective laparoscopic/robotic procedure for known or suspected endometriosis. Exclusion criteria will include: 1) Patients with known contraindications to REL-CT; 2) Any form of hormonal suppression of endometriosis within 4-weeks of the index surgical procedure; 3) Primary language other than English/Spanish; 4) Patients without histologic evidence of endometriosis following their surgical procedure; 5) Patients interested in pregnancy within the 12 months following their surgical procedure.\n\nThe primary outcome will be change in Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP-30) score. A preoperative EHP-30 will be completed by all patients enrolled in the study within 4 weeks of their scheduled surgical procedure and then again postoperatively at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. Investigators expect that postoperative use of REL-CT will lead to a clinically meaningful improvement in EHP-30 scores compared to surgery alone. In addition, investigators will gather data on our secondary outcomes: These data could be very helpful in informing providers and patients of the utility of medical suppression of endometriosis using REL-CT following surgery.",

    "detailed_description": "Unfavorable Intermediate Risk (UIR) Prostate Cancer is prostate cancer that is localized and curable but may require more treatment than external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) alone. In contrast, favorable intermediate risk (FIR) prostate cancer can be treated by EBRT alone. There is evidence that some prostate cancer that is classified through clinical factors as FIR can act more aggressively if also associated with a high risk gene expression score. This type of prostate cancer (traditionally favorable intermediate risk, but with a gene signature that predicts for aggressive disease) presents a treatment dilemma.\n\nRecent evidence suggests that androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is generally beneficial for intermediate risk prostate cancer and so it is possible that these patients (with favorable intermediate risk based on non-genetic factors but with high genetic risk) may also benefit. However, ADT causes very bothersome side effects including hot flashes, fatigue, sexual disfunction, and in some cases, heart problems. In order to balance the benefit and harms of ADT in combination with radiation, we could reduce the length of ADT and make it precisely overlap with radiation treatment. The oral ADT medication Relugolix (Orgovyx) is ideal for this purpose. In addition to shortening ADT, it is important to measure any potential benefit when ADT is added to stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). SBRT is a shorter and more intense version of standard fractionation EBRT.\n\nTherefore, a multicenter randomized phase III study comparing prostate cancer control and quality of life with SBRT + Ultrashort GNRH Antagonist Relugolix (SUGAR) vs. SBRT alone for a category of clinicogenomic unfavorable intermediate risk patients with favorable clinical features and high risk genetic features.",

Your complete medical history will be recorded. You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and weight). Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. You will have a computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, a bone scan, or a chest x-ray to evaluate the status of your disease. You will be asked about any medications or treatments you are currently taking. You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG - a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart) and an echocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to make pictures of your heart, which helps show how well your heart pumps blood. You will be asked to lie on your left side while a technician places a probe with gel on your chest to create images of your heart to determine the function and size. Your ability to perform daily activities will also be evaluated. You will have a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. To collect a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large needle.\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take the sunitinib malate by mouth 1 time a day for 30 days together with hormonal ablation therapy. You will receive hormone injections to lower the levels of testosterone in the blood. Hormonal therapy may be given either monthly for 3 months or in a single 3-month dose. Every 30 days is considered a study \"cycle.\" You may receive up to 3 cycles of treatment.\n\nOn Day 1 of each cycle, you will have a physical exam and you will be asked about your medical history. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. You will be asked about any medications you have taken and any side effects you may have experienced. You will be asked questions about your ability to perform daily activities (performance status evaluation.)\n\nOn Day 15 of Cycle 1, you will be asked about any side effects you have experienced. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine testing.\n\nAfter completing 3 cycles of treatment, you will have surgery to remove your prostate. The surgery will occur 1-2 weeks after you receive the last dose of study drug.\n\nAfter the last dose of the study drug, you will have a follow-up visit. You will be asked about any side effects you are experiencing and you will have a physical exam. You will also have digital rectal exam. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. You will also have an echocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to make pictures of your heart, which helps show how well your heart pumps blood. You will be asked to lie on your left side while a technician places a probe with gel on your chest to create images of your heart to determine the function and size.\n\nYou will have a follow-up visit, 28 days after you stop treatment. You will have a physical exam and your complete medical history will be recorded. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. You will be asked about any medications you have taken and any side effects you may have experienced. You will have a performance status evaluation.

    "detailed_description": "ALLTogether is a European clinical treatment study for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in infants, children and young adults. The aims are to improve survival and quality of survival. In young people, ALL has excellent outcome with an overall survival of about 92% in children and 75% in young adults. Infants with BCP-ALL and KMT2A-rearrangements have a worse outcome and are treated according to separate protocols, but infants with KMT2A-germline and T-cell ALL have acceptable outcome on standard ALL therapy. However, patients still die of disease - from relapse because of under-treatment and a large fraction of patients are also over-treated: All patients risk treatment-related death and some suffer long-term side-effects or secondary cancer. To show improvement with such good survival, large populations are needed.\n\nStudy groups from Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, Finland, Estonia and Lithuania (NOPHO), the UK (UKALL), the Netherlands (DCOG), Germany (COALL), Belgium (BSPHO), Portugal (SHOP), Ireland (PHOAI), and France (SFCE), have designed a common treatment protocol.\n\nThe study has a complex clinical trial design with sub-protocols (the randomisations / intervention) connected to a master protocol. The master protocol consists of well established therapy-elements and in its design typical for current ALL therapy. The master protocol therapy is in the study design considered as standard of care (SOC) therapy for infants, children and young adults with ALL.\n\nThe study structure is defined by a master protocol onto which randomised and interventional sub-protocols as well as sub-studies may be added, run and stop in a modular fashion.\n\nThe randomisations / intervention may identify therapy that is less toxic, but equally efficacious for sub-groups of patients and innovative therapy that may reduce relapses and death from ALL. In the master protocol, improved risk-stratification is likely to increase survival and reduce unnecessary toxicity and the introduction of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of Asparaginase activity will make the use of Asparaginase more rational and efficient and may thus improve overall outcomes.\n\nThe investigators hypothesise that patients stratified to the standard-risk group are over-treated. Therefore, it will be tested if the treatment can be safely reduced. In the R1 randomisation, patients will be randomised to receiving the Delayed Intensification (DI) phase of therapy with or without the anthracycline Doxorubicin.\n\nA similar hypothesis of over-treatment will also be tested in patients stratified to the intermediate risk-low group. In the R2 randomisation patients will be randomly assigned to either removal of Doxorubicin during the DI phase or removal of Vincristine and Dexamethasone pulses during the maintenance phase or to the control group, which will be treated with Doxorubicin in DI as well as Vincristine and Dexamethasone pulses during maintenance. Patients will only be randomised once.\n\nRandomisation R1 and R2 are only considered for children since adults have worse outcome and very poor survival after relapse, but the risk-stratification is likely to reduce the number of high-risk cases also in the adult-group.\n\nPatients stratified as intermediate risk-high (IR-high) are identified as having an increased risk of relapse and thus a less favourable prognosis than the standard- and intermediate risk-low groups, but a more favourable prognosis than the high risk patients. The majority of all relapses in childhood ALL is expected to occur in the IR-high group. Following a relapse, only approximately 40% of the children can be successfully treated again and for adults the corresponding figure is less than 20 %, so preventing relapses is very important. New treatment options that improves the antileukaemic efficacy and which have an improved safety profile are urgently needed.\n\nFor IR-high patients Randomisation 3 (R3) is available. In R3 patients will be randomised to receive either:\n\n1. the addition of two cycles of Inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) - Besponsa\u00ae, before start of the maintenance phase. After these cycles, the patients randomised to the InO arm will receive maintenance for the same duration as in the control arm.\n2. the addition of low dose 6-tioguanine (6TG) as an addition to the standard maintenance therapy.\n3. standard maintenance therapy\n\nPatients with ABL-class fusions in their leukaemic clone will, as a non-randomised experimental intervention, be treated with an addition of a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor during the induction phase (for patients \\<25 years) and from the consolidation phase (patients \u226525 years). This intervention may shift therapy for previously resistant cases to lower intensity treatment with the associated reduced morbidity and may also reduce the number of relapses in analogy with the results in Ph+ ALL. The reason for not performing a randomised comparison is the rarity of the aberration and also the diversity of ABL-class fusions, reducing statistical power for any comparison further. For this reason, the results of this intervention may be pooled with other study-groups trying similar approaches.\n\nA new intervention is introduced for Down syndrome patients with CD19 positive ALL: ALLTogether1 DS (NRI2). For Down syndrome-ALL patients who have end of Induction MRD detectable but \\<25% two conventional chemotherapy consolidation blocks will be replaced with two blocks of Blinatumomab.\n\nFor high-risk B-lineage patients, CAR-T therapy can be an alternative to high-risk blocks and stem-cell transplant, but in this case the intervention (CAR-T infusion) will be performed outside the ALLTogether1 study. However, the stratification-system in ALLTogether1 will define the population with a potential CAR-T indication.\n\nALLTogether1 also includes five sub-studies:\n\nEfficacy and pharmacokinetics of Imatinib in ABL-class fusion positive ALL\n\nTarget population: All ABL-class patients enrolled in the ALLTogether study. Biomaterials to be collected at diagnosis, during TKI treatment, follow-up and relapse.\n\nAims\n\n1.

To determine the phosphorylation status of ABL-class proteins and presence of TKI-resistance associated mutations in ABL genes prior to imatinib treatment and the emergence of such mutations during treatment with imatinib\n6. To determine the presence of mutations in regulatory /other genes before and during imatinib treatment and functionally address the importance of these mutations in TKI resistance\n7. To determine whether the efficacy of TKIs depends on the type of fusion gene\n8. To describe inter- and intraindividual variations in imatinib PK (=trough levels) during therapy of ABL-class ALL\n9.

There are several types of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, including DM and PM.\n\nDM and PM involve weakness of the muscles closest to the center of the body, such as the muscles of the hips, thighs, upper arms, and neck. People with these forms of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies may find it difficult to climb stairs, get up from a seated position, or lift items above their head. People with DM can also have a skin rash.\n\nThese disorders negatively impact the quality of life and functioning of patients. In addition to the above, these disorders can affect how the lungs and heart work.\n\nThis study is seeking participants who took part in a DM and PM study with dazukibart before. Some participants will receive study medicine, and some participants will not receive study medicine and only complete safety follow-up.\n\nThe study medicine will be given as an intravenous (IV) infusion (directly into the veins). This takes about 1 hour, every 4 weeks, from Day 1 to Week 48 (about 12 months) of the study. This will be followed by a safety follow-up period that lasts about 4 months after the last infusion. Participants who receive study medicine will have about 18 study visits at the site over about 16 months.\n\nThere will also be participants enrolled in this study who will not receive study medicine. Such participants will only take part in safety follow-up visits as they do not want to or are not eligible to receive dazukibart.

    "detailed_description": "This is a multi-institutional clinical trial of lorlatinib in children newly diagnosed with High Grade Glioma (HGG) harboring ROS1 (ROS Proto-Oncogene 1, Receptor Tyrosine Kinase) or ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) fusions. In this pilot study, investigators will assess the disease control rate (Continued Complete Response (CCR), Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), and Stable Disease (SD)) of lorlatinib, and feasibility and safety of lorlatinib administration in combination with standard chemotherapy in children with newly diagnosed HGG with ROS or ALK fusions who receive 2 cycles of lorlatinib administered orally, once daily, at 115 mg/m2/day (or maximum of 200mg/dose) continuously. Secondary objectives include overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) lorlatinib as a single agent and in combination with standard chemotherapy used in children \u2264 48 months with HGG, or post focal radiotherapy in children \\> 48 months of age. Children with HGG who have a CCR or CR after 2 cycles of therapy will continue to receive single agent lorlatinib for a total of 12xs 28-day cycles. Continuation of treatment beyond 12 cycles, and up to maximum 26 cycles, may be considered for patients on lorlatinib monotherapy if they are receiving clinical benefit from the study, at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients with PR or SD after 2 cycles of lorlatinib monotherapy will go on to receive lorlatinib either in combination with standard backbone chemotherapy (BABYPOG or HIT-SKK, investigator's choice) or post standard radiotherapy, based on the patient's age. Patients with PD after 2 cycles will be taken off protocol therapy.\n\nBased on recent trials conducted in this patient population, investigators conservatively estimate that 1 child with newly diagnosed DIPG or HGG with either ROS1 or ALK fusion will be enrolled every 2 months on this study. Patients will start at the recommended phase 2 dose of 115 mg/m2/day, continuously for 28 days, and one dose de-de-escalations will be allowed. A maximum of 15 eligible patients will be enrolled, anticipated over 2.5 years.",

    "detailed_description": "Study Groups:\n\nIf you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of a dice) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. You will have an equal chance of being assigned to Group 1 or 2.\n\n* If you are in Group 1, you will receive varenicline and a placebo patch. A placebo is not a drug. It looks like the study drug but is not designed to treat any disease or illness. It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real effect.\n* If you are in Group 2, you will receive an active nicotine patch and a placebo tablet.\n\nNeither you nor the study doctor will know which group you are assigned to. However, if needed for your safety, the study staff will be able to find out what you are receiving (called \"unblinding\").\n\nOnce the study has ended and the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) at MD Anderson has granted approval, you may be unblinded at your request.\n\nStudy Drug Administration:\n\nYou will start taking your assigned study drug(s) the day after Visit 1.\n\nYou should take varenicline/placebo tablets by mouth with a cup (8 ounces) of water after eating a full meal. On Days 1-3, you will take 1 dose of the study drug each morning. Starting on Day 4, and then every day after that, you will take 1 dose in the morning and 1 dose in the evening (for a total of 2 doses of the study drug each day). You must return any study drug bottles as well as any unused study drug to the study staff at each study visit.\n\nYou should apply the nicotine/placebo patch to the upper arm. You should put it in a slightly different place each day to avoid skin irritation. You may take the patch off at night to avoid sleeping problems.\n\nYou will be given a study diary to record how many cigarettes you smoke (if any) each day while you are on study.\n\nYou must return your study diary and any unused study drugs, patches, and/or containers at each study visit.\n\nStudy Visits (Visits 1-7):\n\nAt every study visit:\n\n* You will complete questionnaires about several topics, including depression, suicide, your smoking behavior, and any effects from the study drug. These questionnaires should take about 30-45 minutes in total to complete.\n* You will be giving the opportunity to complete the questionnaires verbally with a study staff member (either on phone or in person depending on the visit number) or electronically on your computer using a website administered by an online survey development company called Qualtrics.\n* You will receive counseling about quitting smoking, where you will talk about possible \"triggers\" for smoking and strategies for dealing with quitting smoking. These sessions will take about 15 minutes each.\n\nAt Visits 1, 4 and 6:\n\n* Urine or saliva will be collected for a routine test to check your cotinine, nicotine, and anabasine levels. Cotinine is a chemical released in your body when it breaks down nicotine and will show whether and how much you have recently smoked. Anabasine is used to show if nicotine is found in the blood due to a nicotine replacement therapy or from tobacco use.\n* Your CO level and weight. will be measured.\n* If you did not have one during screening, you will have a physical exam.\n* If you did not complete at one during screening or before Visit 1, you will complete the EEG/lab session.\n* If you can become pregnant, urine will be collected for a pregnancy test.\n* At V1, if your CO machine tests results are unclear, and the study staff thinks it is appropriate, a NicAlert test will be performed. Urine will be collected for the NicAlert test, which is more sensitive at detecting levels of smoking than the CO machine.\n\nDuring counseling on Day 8, you will set a \"quit date\" for stopping smoking for about 1 week after you start taking the study drug/placebo. You should not quit smoking before the quit date. You may also set goals to reduce smoking. You should try to stay smoke-free after the quit date. You will also be given a drug instruction sheet, a card with emergency contact information, and a participant manual to help you follow along with the topics discussed during counseling.\n\nVisits 2, 3, 5 and 7 will be conducted over the phone. You will complete questionnaires about several topics (either on the phone or electronically), including depression, mood, your smoking behavior, and any effects from the study drug. You will also be asked about any drugs you may be taking. Each call should take about 25-45 minutes.\n\nThe study staff will call you 1 day before your quit date and 3 days after your quit date to check on your progress in quitting smoking. Each call should take about 10-15 minutes.\n\nLab Session:\n\nYou will take part in a lab session at or before Visit 1 to test your brain activity. You will be asked to watch slides. The slides will include pictures of people, nature, and artwork. Slides showing nude people, medical procedures, and victims of car crashes will also be shown. You will be shown examples of these slides before beginning the procedure and given the opportunity to withdraw from the study.\n\nDuring the lab session, your brain electrical activity will be checked with an electroencephalogram (EEG). To do this, small sensors will be placed on your scalp and face. You should not drink more than 2 cups of coffee or other caffeinated drinks for at least 2\u00bd hours before the session. At the lab session, you may be asked to smoke a cigarette if the doctor thinks it is needed for you to show your normal smoking behavior.\n\nYou will also complete computer tasks, including questionnaires that will measure your emotions and attention level. These tasks should take about 90 minutes to complete.\n\nThe lab session may last up to 2 hours.\n\nEcological Momentary Assessments (EMA):\n\nEMA are used to gather information about your mood and cravings as they happen in your day-to-day life. At your randomization visit, you will be loaned a smart phone device, and will be asked to complete questionnaires on the device at different times everyday throughout the active treatment phase (12 weeks). In these questionnaires, you will be asked about events from the previous day, such as cigarettes per day, alcohol intake, mood, sleep, motivation, and whether you took your prescribed drugs on time. These questionnaires should take up to about 20 minutes per day to complete.\n\nLength of Treatment:\n\nYou will receive the study drug/placebo for up to 12 weeks. You will be taken off study early if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\nYour participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.\n\nEnd-of-Treatment Visit (Visit 8):\n\nAfter you have finished taking the study drug/placebo, the following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n* Your CO level will be measured.\n* Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check your liver and kidney function.\n* Urine or saliva will be collected to measure your nicotine, anabasine, and cotinine level.\n* You will complete the same questionnaires you completed at the regular study visits.\n* You will receive counseling about quitting smoking.\n* If you can become pregnant, urine will be collected for a pregnancy test.\n\nFollow-Up Visits (Visits 9 and 10):\n\nAt about 3 and 6 months after you have stopped smoking, the following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n* Your CO level will be measured.\n* Urine or saliva will be collected to measure your nicotine, anabasine, and cotinine level.\n* You will complete the same questionnaires you completed at the regular study visits.\n\nThis is an investigational study. Varenicline and the nicotine patch are both FDA approved and commercially available to help people stop smoking. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.\n\nUp to 160 participants will be enrolled in this portion of the study. All will take part at MD Anderson.",

    "brief_summary": "Chronic daily headaches (CDH) poses a significant burden on patients, healthcare systems and the society. Intravenous (IV) ketamine infusion, an intervention that is widely available and scalable, can treat CDH by reversing receptor-mediated sensitization. This study is a multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel group randomized trial with blinding of participants and observers with the goal of comprehensively assessing the effect of high-dose IV ketamine infusion (1 mg.kg-1.h-1 for six hours) on the frequency and intensity of headaches, mood, activity, sleep, quality of life and safety of ketamine for three months after the interventions. Use of validated questionnaires, wearable technology, a research team that includes investigators with expertise in studying ketamine and in evaluating treatments for CDH and pain syndromes are some of the unique features of this project.\n\nOur study aims to prospectively assess the efficacy and safety of high-dose intravenous ketamine infusions compared to saline infusions in participants with CDH syndrome.",
    "detailed_description": "The KetHead study is designed as a multi-center, placebo-controlled, superiority randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups and blinding of participants and outcome assessors. It will be conducted at two chronic pain centers, Toronto Western Hospital and Sinai Health System. Eligible patients will be identified and enrolled in the pain clinics. Randomization will take place upon patient enrollment. Treating physicians, patients, close contacts, study coordinators and primary outcome assessors will be blinded to treatment allocation.\n\nInterventions common to both arms Participating patients will receive the infusion at the pain infusion unit at Toronto Western Hospital, under hemodynamic monitoring, supervised by an Anesthesiologist. At the start of the infusion, all patients will receive IV midazolam 0.04 mg.kg-1 (maximum 3 mg) and subsequently 0.01-0.02 mg.kg-1 every hour to keep participants in a sedated but arousable state (Ramsay Sedation Scale score 3 or 4)22 to blind the participants and assessors to group allocation. Eight mg of ondansetron and 8 mg of dexamethasone will be administered to all participants to prevent nausea, 5000 units of heparin will be given subcutaneously to prevent thrombo-embolic events. Medications will be administered by an Anesthesiologist.\n\nA. Intervention group: For individuals randomized to the IV Ketamine group, 1 mg.kg-1 bolus will be given. This will be prepared as a syringe of 10 cc of Ketamine 10 mg/ml. This is followed by an infusion of 1 mg.kg-1.hour-1 (ketamine diluted in saline to 2 mg/mL at 0.5 mL.kg-1.hour-1) for six hours.\n\nB. Control group: For individuals in the saline infusion group, an IV bolus of 0.9% saline will be given. The volume will be the same as that of the ketamine bolus for that weight, to prevent unblinding of participants and assessors. This will be followed by an infusion 0.5 mL.kg-1.hour-1 of saline for six hours. The rate of the infusion will be the same as that of a ketamine infusion for that weight to prevent unblinding of participants and assessors.\n\nStudy personnel will assess patient and collect data throughout their enrollment in the study.\n\nDuring the trial, patients will be instructed to use a pain and migraine diary for collection of migraine days, pain scores and rescue pain medication during the 12 weeks after infusion.\n\nPatients will be assessed for collection of outcomes immediately after the infusion and at 1-month, 2-months and 3-months after infusion.\n\nParticipants in both arms will wear the actigraphy device starting on the day of infusion for one month to longitudinally assess the impact of the study treatments on sleep and activity.",

    "detailed_description": "There are no effective treatments for GA. Systemic corticosteroids can be effective in temporarily controlling GA; however, GA patients are almost never treated with systemic steroids due to the myriad potential adverse effects of this drug class and its transient effect on disease control. Intralesional (intradermal) steroid injections can be effective in patients with localized GA but are not really an option for patients with BSA \\> 1-2%, require frequent clinic visits for injection, are painful, and also only transiently control disease. A variety of other treatment approaches have been described and include: antibiotics (minocycline, doxycycline, others), hydroxychloroquine, phototherapy, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, among others. However, these therapies are rarely effective. GA is notoriously recalcitrant to treatment.\n\nWith no FDA approved therapies for GA and current approaches being broadly ineffective; there is a large unmet need for an effective treatment. Likely in part because of under recognition, GA is designated as a rare disease by the National Organization for Rare Disorders. Progress in the treatment of GA has been impaired by a poor understanding of disease pathogenesis. Not only will this study allow for greater clarity regarding the pathogenesis of GA, but an oral treatment option for patients that is easier to administer compared to other therapies (such as injections) and with less potential systemic side effects.",

Cardiac planar radionuclide imaging using 99mTc-labeled bone seeking radiopharmaceuticals is used as a noninvasive diagnostic criterion in patients without detectable monoclonal protein. The visual assessment remains the main noninvasive criterion for the diagnosis. Medical therapy using tafamidis meglumine that binds to transthyretin and prevents amyloidogenesis, recently demonstrated a reduction in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations. As a consequence, there is a need for quantitative approaches that would be useful for diagnosis and prognosis assessment but also for the evaluation of patient therapeutic response.\n\nMaterials and methods: The investigators aim to include 35 patients with a suspected diagnosis of cardiac ATTR amyloidosis in whom a cardiac planar radionuclide imaging using 99mTc-labeled bone seeking radiopharmaceuticals is planned as part of routine noninvasive diagnosis work-up. Using a test-retest approach, the aim is to compare a quantitative method vs. conventional semi-quantitative approaches for the assessment of cardiac uptake of bone radiopharmaceuticals using new 3D CZT-based SPECT-CT cameras in patients with suspected cardiac ATTR amyloidosis. The investigators estimated that 20 patients will have a diagnosis of cardiac ATTR amyloidosis. In the latter patients, the aim is to evaluate the impact of 6-month therapy using tafamidis on quantitative and semi-quantitative assessment of cardiac uptake of bone radiopharmaceuticals Perspectives: This new non invasive imaging techniques for the quantitative assessment of the amyloid burden in patients with cardiac ATTR amyloidosis may help identify the responders and the patients who should benefit from dose intensification.",

    "detailed_description": "Background Bispecific antibodies targeting CD3 and BCMA have demonstrated astonishing efficacy with response rates of nearly 65 % in triple class exposed patients with multiple myeloma (MM). This will not necessarily be the first product to be marketed, but might be a product proven to be applicable for safe and convenient self-administration in the patients' homes, thereby improving the patients' and their caregivers' Quality of Life (QoL) and reducing the burden on the healthcare system. Although optimal dosing regimens are still being investigated, most CD3xBCMA are given weekly until progression, with the possibility of downscaling to twice monthly, if good remission is obtained. Consequently, patients have multiple visits to the outpatient clinic, meaning that they spend a substantial amount of time on transport, and that they are continuously exposed to potential infections. Furthermore, the outpatient clinic might end out with many bispecific treatments in the future, due to their high efficiency, thus straining the logistics of the hospital.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that patients who administer their treatment themselves experience better QoL, a higher level of well-being, and have a higher level of daily activity. In addition, socio-economic savings of up to 20-50% are seen with self-administration compared to outpatient treatment.\n\nElranatamab is a bispecific CD3xBCMA with some unique properties; it is given subcutaneously as a fixed dose, and it has shown a remarkably low risk of CRS after the third injection. This makes it a perfect candidate to investigate in a setup, where patients are trained in self-administration at their own homes.\n\nAcquiring source data and planned visits In the study, Elranatamab will be administered as monotherapy for six cycles of 28 days (Table 1). Patients will receive subcutaneous Elranatamab 76 mg QW with a 2-step-up priming dose regimen administered during the first week (12 mg D1 and 32 mg D4). For safety reasons, the step-up doses will be administered with hospitalization for a minimum of 48hr (C1D1) and 24hr (C1D4), respectively. During hospitalization, vital signs will be measured at least 6 times per overnight stay. If treatment is tolerated, C1D8, C1D15 and C1D22 will be administered in the outpatient clinic and will include training of the patients in self-administration. In cycle 2 to cycle 6, patients will administer the treatment themselves in the outpatient clinic D1 and at home D8, D15 and D22. However, if patients experience any CRS during the study, the consecutive two doses must be administered in the outpatient clinic without any signs of CRS, before home treatment can be resumed. If patients experience ICANS, they will be taken off study.\n\nPrior to each new treatment cycle, laboratory assessments will be conducted at the local hospital or at the patient's GP, according to general standards. A hematologist at Odense University Hospital, who will also evaluate the patient, must accept the laboratory assessments before D1 of all cycles.\n\nFurther, the following data will be collected to meet the secondary endpoints:\n\nAt inclusion, data on age, gender, marital status, PS, R-ISS, ISS, vital signs, myeloma type, renal and liver function, concomitant medication (CM), weight, number of previous lines of treatment and response to previous lines of treatment will be registered in an electronic case report form (eCRF). Further, patients will be physically examined and cognitively tested, which will include a writing test and a test of their ability to recognize known pictures. Finally, patients must complete the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the FACT Cognitive questionnaires electronically.\n\nDuring planned hospitalization in cycle 1, patients will be continuously examined, and data on PS, vital signs, results of blood samples, CM, AEs and results of CRS and ICANS screening will be collected. Similar data will be collected at C1D8, C1D15 and C1D22.\n\nStarting from cycle 2, data on location of administration will be collected. Specifically, redirected administrations and discarded doses will be registered. When patients show in the outpatient clinic at D1, they will be physically examined, and data on PS, vital signs, results of blood samples, CM, AEs, weight and result of CRS and ICANS screening will be collected. Further, patients should complete the EORTC QLQ-C30 electronically. If they do not complete the questionnaire during their visit at the outpatient clinic, it can be completed from home the following days, but no later than two days after treatment (D3).\n\nBefore each home administration (D8, D15 and D22), patients will receive an electronic questionnaire on their physical and cognitive condition. They must answer if they have had a fever (they will be instructed in measuring their temperature before every injection), dizziness or any other sickness, or if they have received any antibiotics since their last administration. Further, to rule out any grade of ICANS, they will be cognitively tested. The questionnaire must be filled in within two days prior to the administration. On the day of treatment, a specialized nurse from the outpatient clinic will assess the responses and call the patient in the morning to make sure there are no unexpected problems or fever, which would be incompatible with treatment.\n\nAt D1 (in the outpatient clinic) and D8 (at home) in cycle 2-6, patients, caregivers, nurses and physicians in the outpatient clinic must register their time spent on the administration. For patients and caregivers, this includes waiting time and time spent on transportation. Further, they should register their mode of transportation and if they have had any need for taking time off from work due to the planned administration. For nurses and physicians, this includes both administrative and time spent with the patient.\n\nThroughout the study, patients must register if they have had any unplanned contact with the healthcare system (e.g. to with the Department of Hematology or their GP). For this purpose, they will automatically be contacted electronically each week, and if they register any unplanned contacts, a study nurse will contact them for clarification and register the cause of the contact.\n\nAt EOT, patients and caregivers must complete a questionnaire on their preferences (treatment at home or in the outpatient clinic). Moreover, patients must complete the EORTC QLQ-C30 and FACT Cognitive questionnaires. Finally, patients and caregivers will be interviewed individually.\n\nAt EOS, a focus group interview with involved health care professionals at the outpatient clinic will be conducted.\n\nSafety considerations and drug administration The most common AE associated with Elranatamab is CRS. The treatments in the first cycle will be administered at the hospital; the two priming doses with hospitalization and the others in the outpatient clinic. Further, to reduce the grade of CRS, patients will receive premedications including corticosteroid, antihistamine and antipyretic for both priming doses and for the first full dose. If no CRS is observed, only antihistamine and antipyretic will be used in the following treatments. Treatment will not be released for self-administration before cycle 2, at which time the risk of severe CRS is considered minimal. Further, to reduce the risk of infections, patients will receive infection prophylaxis in the form of Sulfametoxazole with Trimethoprim 80/400mg daily, Ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily, as well as immunoglobulin substitution, if polyclonal IgG drops below 5 g/L.\n\nBefore each new treatment cycle is initiated, laboratory assessments will be conducted at the local hospital or the patient's GP, according to general standards. A hematologist at Odense University Hospital, who will also evaluate the patient, must accept the laboratory assessments before treatment is released. Before each home administration (D8, D15 and D22), the patient must answer an electronic questionnaire on their physical and cognitive condition. This includes questions on whether they have had a fever, dizziness or any other sickness, and if they have received any antibiotics since last their last administration). Further, to rule out any grade of CRS or infection, patients will be instructed in measuring their temperature before every injection and report the result electronically. Finally, to rule out any grade of ICANS, they will be cognitively tested, which will include a writing test and a test of their ability to recognize known pictures.\n\nAt the day of administration, a specialized nurse will assess the responses and call the patient in the morning to make sure no unexpected problems or fever have occurred. If all criteria are met, the nurse will contact the Hospital Pharmacy that will prepare the treatment and send it directly to the patient by car.\n\nCRS and ICANS Management of CRS and ICANS will be handled as per local guideline following ASTCT guidelines.\n\nIf the patients experience CRS (any grade) at any time, the patients must receive the two consecutive doses under observation at the hospital. Patients experiencing ICANS (any grade) will be excluded from the study.\n\nSide effects Registration and reporting of AE, SAE and SUSAR All protocol registered AEs, SAEs and product quality complaints, whether serious or non-serious, related or not related, collected as per national guidelines to the licensed medical holder (\u00a9Pfizer) will be registered in the eCRF. SAEs will be assessed by PI as either Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR), Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR) or non-related SAE.

    "detailed_description": "PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that regulates the cell cycle through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR pathway. When germline mutations in PTEN occur, the result is Cowden syndrome (or less commonly one of several related disorders collectively called the PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome). This is characterized by the growth of hamartomas and a high risk of cancer in multiple organ systems. This includes colon polyps in 92.5% of Cowden syndrome patients and 64% with an estimated 50 or more polyps. Although outcomes of this are under reported, series suggest 20-38% of patients will receive colectomy.\n\nCurrent clinical practice for Cowden syndrome is based on close surveillance for the development of cancers. Sirolimus (also known as rapamycin) is a specific inhibitor of mTOR that is FDA-approved for immunosuppression and use in several types of cancers as chemotherapy. It has also been used successfully in other hamartomatous syndromes including lymphangioleiomyomatosis. There is also a completed pilot clinical trial for adults with Cowden syndrome in which some had reduction in the number of colon polyps with the use of the medication sirolimus for a very short time period.\n\nThis will be an open-label pilot trial to determine whether sirolimus reduces colon polyp burden in Cowden syndrome. Sirolimus will be administered for one year. Colonoscopy with polyp estimation will be performed at trial entrance and at study completion.",

    "detailed_description": "Acute myeloid leukemia is a malignancy that is still fatal for the majority of patients. Besides age, the genetic configuration of AML blasts is one of the strongest prognostic factors. Patients with mutations in the core-binding factor (CBF) genes have the best prognosis, however a considerable proportion of 35-60% will eventually relapse. Mutation and overexpression of receptor tyrosinkinases (RTK) have been proposed as main reasons for relapse development or chemoresistance in CBF AMLs. RTKs like stem cell factor receptor (c-KIT) and FLT3 are of high clinical relevance as they mediate proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. There is evidence that c-Kit mutations and high levels of c-KIT in CBF-AML have adverse effects on survival endpoints indicating c-KIT as potential therapeutic target in this special AML population. Midostaurin can be considered a potent c-KIT inhibitor besides having multi-kinase inhibitory activity for several other kinases of documented or potential pathogenetic relevance for AML, most importantly mutated FLT3. The kinase inhibition ultimately leads to inhibition of proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Previous studies with other c-KIT inhibitors such as dasatinib showed promising results with respect to survival end points in newly diagnosed CBF AML patients. Midostaurin is considered a more potent c-KIT inhibitor than dasatinib and may be able to potentiate the inhibitory effect on leukemic cell growth.\n\nAnother important therapeutical target in CBF AML is the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (CD33) which is expressed on the majority of AML blasts. Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (GO) is a therapeutic CD33 antibody linked to a strong cytostatic drug (calicheamicin) which causes apoptosis of cancer cells upon internalization. For the combination of GO and standard intensive chemotherapy, metaanalyses of randomized trials have shown that i) a low-dose fractionated administration results in the best tolerability, and ii) among AML subgroups, patients with CBF AML have the greatest benefit from GO in addition to standard therapy. Subgroup analyses within the ALFA-0701 (A Randomized Study of Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin With Daunorubicine and Cytarabine in Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia Aged of 50-70 Years Old) trial population showing beneficial effects of GO on overall survival, relapse-free survival and event-free survival in patients positive for FLT3 mutation as compared to those negative for FLT3 mutation. Subgroup analyses of the GO registration trial ALFA-0701 showed a significant clinical benefit of the patients displaying a mutation in the FLT3 gene compared to those without this mutation. In Addition, CBF AML patients with FLT3 mutations expressed particularly high levels of CD33 antigen and that CD33 antigen levels were positively correlated to the improved survival after GO treatment. Furthermore, recently published data of two paediatric populations with internal tandem mutation in the FLT3 gene showed reduced relapse rates in GO recipients compared to the control group only receiving standard chemotherapy. These results suggest that GO is a particularly beneficiary agent in FLT3 mutated patients who would currently receive midostaurin in addition to intensive chemotherapy as a standard of care. Hence, from a clinical point of view there is an unambiguous rationale supporting the combination of midostaurin and GO for treatment of AML in the two cytogenetic subgroups: CBF AML and FLT3 mutated AML.\n\nGO has become the new treatment standard for patients with CBF AML. The hypothesized positive effect of midostaurin is likely but randomized proof is laking.\n\nMidostaurin has become the new treatment standard for AML patients with mutations in the FLT3 gene. The positive effect of GO is shown in a post-hoc subgroup analysis of the ALFA-0701 trial, but prospective randomized proof is lacking.\n\nTherefore, the proposed trial intends i) to explore and establish the safe combination of GO plus midostaurin (MODULE) and ii) to evaluate the effect of midostaurin versus no midostaurin added to standard AML chemotherapy plus GO in CBF AML (MAGNOLIA) and iii) to evaluate the effect of GO versus no GO added to standard AML chemotherapy plus midostaurin in FLT3 mutated AML (MAGMA).",

Sometimes, multiple myeloma does not respond to current therapy or quickly progresses, and this is called refractory multiple myeloma.\n\nElranatamab is a study medicine that target multiple myeloma and activates the human body to fight against this disease. We are seeking Chinese participants to take part in this study. The study will be 2 parts, called part 1b and part 2. In part 1b, participants will receive Elranatamab at 2 steps priming and full dose as a sc (subcutaneous injection) therapy. We will monitor participants' safety and reactions to the study medicine. This will help us understand the dosage of Elranatamab to be used safely.\n\nIn part 2 of the study, participants will receive Elranatamab and their multiple myeloma growth will be monitored. This will help us understand if Elranatamab, when used alone, may be a therapy for refractory multiple myeloma. Participants in this part of the study are expected to take part for about 2 years.",

These 6 weeks are considered 1 cycle of study treatment.\n\nDuring Cycle 2, you will have surgery to remove the tumor. You will start taking sunitinib malate again after surgery (at least 14 days after surgery) on the same schedule as before.\n\nStudy Visits:\n\nAt the beginning of each new cycle (Cycles 1-6), you will have the following tests:\n\n* Your complete medical history will be recorded.\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, and weight.\n* You will have a performance status evaluation.\n* You will be asked about any medicines you are currently taking and if you have experienced any side effects since your last visit.\n* You will have blood drawn (about 4 teaspoons) for routine testing. This blood will also be tested to check the function of your thyroid gland.\n* You will have follow-up scans (the same ones you had during screening to check the disease status) at the beginning of Cycle 2, after you have surgery, and at the beginning of each of the next 4 cycles.\n* You will have an ECG to measure the health of your heart.\n\nEvery 2 Cycles, you will have a follow-up echocardiogram or MUGA scan to check your heart function, if your doctor feels it is needed.\n\nBeginning in Cycle 7, you will be asked to return to the clinic every other cycle (about every 12 weeks), unless your doctor thinks you should return more often. This means you would return for clinic visits at the start of Cycles 8, 10, 12, and so on, and may be asked to come back at other times.\n\nAt each visit, you will have the following tests:\n\n* Your complete medical history will be recorded.\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.\n* You will have a performance status evaluation.\n* You will be asked about any medicines you are currently taking and if you have experienced any side effects since your last visit.\n* You will have blood drawn (about 4 teaspoons) for routine testing at the beginning of each cycle.

This blood will also be tested to check the function of your thyroid gland.\n* You will be asked about any medicines you are currently taking and if you have experienced any side effects since your last visit.\n* You will have follow-up scans (the same as at screening) to check the status of the disease.\n* You will have an ECG to measure the health of your heart.\n\nLong-Term Follow-Up:\n\nFollowing the post-treatment visit, you will be contacted regularly to check the status of the disease. You will be contacted (by telephone or routine clinic visit) every 6-12 weeks for the first 2 years, and every 6 months after that for up to 5 years.\n\nThis is an investigational study. Sunitinib malate is commercially available and FDA approved for treatment of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. At this time, its use in combination with surgery is for research only. Up to 50 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.",

    "brief_summary": "Lack of adherence to treatment is a widespread issue worldwide, which leads to higher healthcare utilisation rates and even premature death. While the level of adherence may differ based on the specific condition and treatment, studies estimate that approximately 50% of medications are not taken according to the prescribed instructions. In addition, adherence rates tend to decrease even further when the treatment requires a behavioural change. Literature reviews about factors that affect people's adherence show that it is challenging to predict whom can be considered to have adherent and non-adherent behaviours. In addition, the studies highlight that it is challenging to support a person to be adherent. Based on this knowledge the BEAMER project was established (Behavioural and Adherence Model for improving quality, health outcomes and cost-Effectiveness of healthcaRe). The overall goal of the project is to improve the quality of life of individuals, enhance healthcare accessibility and sustainability, thereby transforming the way healthcare stakeholders engage with patients to understand their condition and adherence levels throughout their healthcare journey. To address the overall goal, the BEAMER project has developed a disease agnostic model named \"B-COMPASS: BEAMER-COmputational Model for Patient Adherence and Support Solutions\". The aim of the B-COMPASS is to identify patients' needs and preferences which enables the creation of patient-specific supports, with the intention of improving their adherence to treatment within the heterogeneity of the different disease-areas and healthcare contexts. Based on the validated BEAMER questionnaire, the B-COMPASS predicts relative adherence and offers an elicitation process of patient needs and preferences to enable targeted supports to improve patient adherence. This results in an allocation of patients to different groups based on their needs and preferences. Overall, the B-COMPASS provides patient insights that will enable more effective design of patient support, most likely resulting in better patient experience, improved adherence and lower healthcare and societal costs.\n\nSo far, several activities from a technical and user perspective have already been conducted in the project to refine the B-COMPASS. This has been done by applying an iterative mixed method approach were both stakeholders (regulator, pharma, academic/research and small and medium-sized enterprises) and end users (patients, health providers and health systems) have been involved. Despite the finetuning of the B-COMPASS, the effectiveness of the B-COMPASS hinges on empirical investigations into the structural elements that impact patient behaviour and the identification of predictive factors that can assist healthcare providers' (HCP) and Research Leads in designing more effective treatment plans (the term HCPs/Research Lead include both the individuals and the institutions where care is delivered). Therefore, validation studies will be conducted to assess the B-COMPASS's performance in six therapeutic areas (cardiovascular, endocrinology, immunology, neurology, oncology and rare diseases) with patients recruited in at least Italy (FISM), Portugal (APDP and MEDIDA) Norway (AHUS), Spain (FHUNJ and FIIBAP), The Netherlands (WDO), and Germany (UDUS). The collected data will be used to evaluate the B-COMPASS's capacity to attend to a variety of needs and challenges for adherence.",
    "detailed_description": "The aim of the study is to validate the B-COMPASS in real-life settings. Overall, the purpose is to provide evidence 1) to validate the B-COMPASS (primary purpose), and 2) to demonstrate the effectiveness and implementability of the B-COMPASS (secondary purpose). The project will carry out the final iterative steps of refining the model, guided by the validation studies that have been conducted. This process will be based on evaluating the performance of the generic model across six selected therapeutic areas (cardiovascular, endocrinology, immunology, neurology, oncology and rare diseases). Study participants (patients and HCPs) will be recruited (at least) from Italy, Portugal, Norway, Spain, The Netherlands, and Germany, and the validation will evaluate the capacity to attend to a variety of needs and challenges for adherence to treatment.\n\nOverall, the study has 8 Scientific Questions (SQs), where SQ 1-4 address the validity of the B-COMPASS (primary purpose) and SQ 5-8 address the effectiveness and implementability of the B-COMPASS (secondary purpose). The SQs are:\n\nSQ 1 How accurately does the B-COMPASS predict the relative adherence to treatment for patients? SQ 2 How valid are the B-COMPASS groupings? SQ 3 How accurately are the patient support needs identified by the B-COMPASS? SQ 4 How reliable is the B-COMPASS over time? SQ 5 To what extent does the use of the B-COMPASS affect patient adherence to treatment? SQ 6 How do the patients perceive the received engagement with HCPs/Research Leads based on the B-COMPASS? SQ 7 How do HCPs/Research Leads perceive the B-COMPASS? SQ 8 How does the B-COMPASS impact the cost-effectiveness of healthcare utilisation?",

In this context, the association axitinib plus pembrolizumab has already been evaluated in several studies with positive results for Progression Free survival, Overall survival and Complete response. The combo received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, and the European Commission approves the extension of Marketing Authorization in first line for metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients.\n\nIn a context of treatment with a new association, it is important to manage the toxicities closely in order to allow the patients to have an optimal treatment. The underlying hypothesis is that the use of new information and communication technologies could improve clinical patient management.\n\nIn this study, we wish assess the impact of monitoring via the web application KidneyPRO on the quality of life of patients with the new combination of treatment axitinib/pembrolizumab for a renal cell carcinoma in first line.",
    "detailed_description": "Metastatic or locally advanced clear cell renal carcinomas (RCC) are treated with targeted therapies (inhibitors of tyrosine kinases) and immune check-points inhibitors.\n\nIn first line many combos are tested. Association of TKI-PD L1-inhibitor is one option. Axitinib-Pembrolizumab showed very high response rate and progression free survival compared to Sunitinib but immunotherapies have a specific adverse event profile. Actually, there is no standardized follow-up for this type of treatment.\n\nIt is important to develop new strategies that reduce the resources used while improving the performance of this surveillance for the benefit of patients, to improve the comfort of patients, to improve the compliance and to optimise the dose of treatment received, in a course of care reworked by maintaining a continuous contact not demanding.\n\nIn collaboration with the Scientific Research National Center, the theory of chaos and its derivatives was applied to cancer and a web-application was developed on these concepts to remotely analyze the dynamics of the symptoms felt by the patient and early detect a recurrence or a complication of his cancer. Clinical symptoms are self-assessed by patients once a week, transcribed on their smartphone or computer through the Internet application. Relevant clinical events are detected using data processing algorithms, combining the dynamics of the various reported symptoms. In this case, an alert message is sent to the health care team. The referring oncologist is thus warned early. He can then make a telephone call to the patient about the reality of the medical alert and summon him for a check-up or any other complementary examination.\n\nApplied to lung cancer, this application is a tried-and-tested solution with a phase III clinical trial. The main criteria was overall survival. The monitoring of these patients with the web-application and with a number of scanners reduced by 50% compared to the reference arm, made it possible to diagnose relapses earlier, to treat them under better conditions and, above all, to improve statistically significant overall survival (a gain in overall survival of 26% at 1 year (in patients intending to treat): 49% in the standard arm versus 75% in the experimental arm: p = 0.0025. This profit persists with 2 years of decline (a median gain in overall survival of 7.6 months, p=0.0312).\n\nThis concept was confirmed in the NCT0578006 study published by Basch et al. Basch used a similar application during chemotherapy treatment in 766 cancer patients. The web-application has improved overall survival by 5 months (Hazard ratio: 0.83).\n\nThis web-application provided a statistical improvement in the quality of life for lung cancer, access to new therapeutic lines (74% versus 33%, p \\<0.001) and optimally with treatments delivered at therapeutic doses (in 76% versus 34%) and faster access to supportive care for a clear improvement in the general condition of patients (77 versus 33%, p \\<0.001). The key for these patients who experienced many treatment toxicities was to use a better method of active follow-up.\n\nA real-time survey of quality of life of Renal Cell Cancer patients receiving Axitinib/Pembrolizumab is an objective that has never been evaluated. This study will allow to generate data in patients who were not included in the phase III study (KEYNOTE 426): Performance Status =2, with central nervous system metastasis and with renal insufficiency. Personalized monitoring of these patients with the web-application KidneyPRO is even more relevant because the aim would be to quickly provide care adapted to adverse events, supportive care in case of loss of activity...\n\nThe web-application KidneyPRO investigated has been developed for this purpose.",

This type of cancer would have spread from where it started (breast) to other parts of the body and would be tough to treat. The study is seeking for participants who have breast cancer that:\n\n* is hard to treat (advanced) and may have spread to other organs (metastatic).\n* is sensitive to hormonal therapy (it is called estrogen receptor positive).\n* is no longer responding to treatments taken before starting this study.\n\nAll the participants will receive vepdegestrant and PF-07220060. Both medicines will be taken by mouth. The medicines will be taken at home. The experience of people receiving the study medicines will be studied. This will help see if the study medicines are safe and effective.

Each study cohort will open/close independently of other study cohorts. Once a study cohort reaches the prespecified number of participants, it will be closed to further enrollment, unless an expansion phase is planned.\n\nThe study is structured to allow for additional cohorts to be added as the study progresses.

Gemtuzmab ozogamicin is a class of drugs known as an antibody drug conjugate. The drug is given on days 1,4,7. It is infused, attaches to cells with a certain marker on the surface (the majority of which would be leukemia cells). The drug is then internalized and the chemotherapy drug becomes activated. Gemtuzumab is currently FDA approved for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.\n\nThe infusion of leukocytes to stimulate the immune system to fight your leukemia is investigational and has not been proven to cure cancer. This combination of Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin and donor leukocytes is not an FDA approved treatment and is investigational.\n\nInitially a total of 6 patients will be included in the study to assess the safety of the treatment. Once 6 patients have been treated and no unacceptable toxicities are seen, more patients will be enrolled. The study will treat up to 18 patients on the study.",

    "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well the combination of avelumab with liposomal doxorubicin with or without binimetinib, or the combination of avelumab with sacituzumab govitecan works in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer that is stage IV or is not able to be removed by surgery (unresectable) and has come back (recurrent). Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors like avelumab require activation of the patient's immune system.\n\nThis trial includes a two week induction or lead-in of medications that can stimulate the immune system. It is our hope that this induction will improve the response to immunotherapy with avelumab. One treatment, sacituzumab Govitecan, is a monoclonal antibody called sacituzumab linked to a chemotherapy drug called SN-38. Sacituzumab govitecan is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as Tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TROP2) receptors, and delivers SN-38 to kill them. Another treatment, liposomal doxorubicin, is a form of the anticancer drug doxorubicin that is contained in very tiny, fat-like particles. It may have fewer side effects and work better than doxorubicin, and may enhance factors associated with immune response. The third medication is called binimetinib, which may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth, and may help activate the immune system. It is not yet known whether giving avelumab in combination with liposomal doxorubicin with or without binimetinib, or the combination of avelumab with sacituzumab govitecan will work better in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer.",
    "detailed_description": "OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 active arms. The three previous study arms are closed to further accrual.\n\nARM A: Patients receive binimetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for a lead-in period of 15 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive binimetinib PO BID on days 1-28, avelumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15, and liposomal doxorubicin IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM B: Patients receive sacituzumab govitecan IV on days -15 for a lead-in period in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive sacituzumab govitecan day 8 and day 15 of Cycle (C) 1; day 1, 8, and 21 of C2; day 1, 15 and 21 of C3; day 8 and 15 of C4, and the schedule continues with two weeks on, one week off for 21-day cycles which repeat in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM C: Patients receive liposomal doxorubicin IV over 60 minutes on day -15 for a lead-in period of 15 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive liposomal doxorubicin IV over 60 minutes on day 15 and avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 6 months for a minimum of 1 year. Participants will be followed every 3 months after experiencing disease progression to assess for survival/anti-cancer therapy status until death or 1 year after Cycle 1 Day 1.\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Anti-tumor effect of avelumab in combination with different therapeutic agents explored in the sub-protocols of the trial.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Additional anti-tumor effects.\n\nII. Safety and tolerability of avelumab in combination with different therapeutic agents explored in the sub-protocols of the trial.\n\nIII. Patient reported outcomes (PRO) between baseline and cycle 3 day 1 across arms.\n\nIV. Longitudinal trends in PRO outcomes across treatment arms.\n\nV. Differences in PRO outcomes for patients who respond compared to those who do not respond.\n\nCORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the therapeutic predictive role of the following on clinical outcome as well as changes with induction therapy with either liposomal doxorubicin or targeted agents:\n\n1. PD-L1 expression and immune 'hot-spots'.\n2. Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)s, and Cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) and Cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) positivity in TIL.\n3. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A (MHC-I) and HLA-DR (MHC-II), FoxP3, OX40 and OX40L, phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), and MYC expression.\n4. Number/levels of expressed predicted class I and class II neoantigens, central memory T-cells and T-cells.\n5. Expression of effector/regulatory immune gene, innate PD-1 resistance signature (IPRES), and B cell, T cell, and/or macrophage signatures.\n6. Basal or claudin-low molecular subtypes.\n7. T cell receptor (TCR) clonality in the tumor and peripheral blood.\n8. Genomic mutational burden.\n\nII. To determine if circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) results will discriminate pseudo-progression from true progression.\n\nIII. To determine if certain genomic alterations detected in tumor tissue or ctDNA are potentially associated with resistance to the tested drug combinations.\n\nIV. To correlate the composition of the pretreatment microbiome with response and secondary endpoints in each arm of the trial.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.\n\nARM A: Patients receive binimetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for a lead-in period of 15 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive binimetinib PO BID on days 1-28, avelumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15, and liposomal doxorubicin IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM B: Patients receive sacituzumab govitecan IV on days -15 and -8 as a lead-in period in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive sacituzumab govitecan IV on days 1 and 8 and avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM C: Patients receive liposomal doxorubicin IV over 60 minutes on day -15. Patients then receive liposomal doxorubicin IV over 60 minutes on day 15 and every 4 weeks thereafter. Patients also receive avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15.

    "detailed_description": "Although their approach is different, both interventions are aimed to obtain a quick and robust disease control and to maintain it over time. Compelling evidence exists that in children with chronic arthritis early intensive therapy may take advantage of the so-called \"window of opportunity\", in which the biology of the disease can be altered to improve long-term disease outcomes, including prevention of cumulative joint damage. Recent experiences in children with systemic JIA have shown that early anti-IL-1 therapy may lead to rapid achievement of inactive disease and allow early treatment discontinuation without disease relapses in many patients. The benefits of early treatment with biologic agents in other JIA categories are less clear, but convincing evidence has been recently reported for polyarthritis.",

Talazoparib has been approved for use in breast cancer, and tazemetostat has been approved for use in certain types of sarcoma and lymphoma.\n\nTalazoparib is an orally administered molecularly targeted chemotherapy drug called a \"PARP inhibitor\", which acts to block the ability of cancer cells to repair certain forms of damage to their DNA - the accumulation of damaged DNA causes certain cancer cells to die. Other PARP inhibitors are already approved for use in prostate cancer patients with specific gene mutations detected in their blood or in their cancer, and talazoparib is currently being studied for treatment of prostate cancer in other clinical trials.\n\nTazemetostat is an orally administered molecularly targeted chemotherapy drug called an \"EZH2 inhibitor\", which acts to block the production of proteins encoded by DNA in the cancer cells that are important in cancer growth and survival. Tazemetostat is also being studied for the treatment of prostate cancer in other clinical trials. In the laboratory setting, tazemetostat causes changes in protein levels in prostate cancer cells that make them sensitive to dying in the presence of PARP inhibitors.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nThe study design involves two parts. The first part is called the \"dose escalation\" to find a safe dose for the combination of talazoparib and tazemetostat.

    "detailed_description": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the intervention is being studied and the researchers are trying to find out more about it- for example, the side effects it may cause, and the activity of a drug, or combination of drugs, against a cancer.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are evaluating the activity of fulvestrant alone, fulvestrant and palbociclib, or fulvestrant, palbociclib, and avelumab combined, in participants with metastatic hormone receptor positive HER2 negative breast cancer that has previously stopped responding to prior palbociclib and endocrine therapy.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved both palbociclib and fulvestrant as treatment options for this disease, however the use of palbociclib has not been studied in people who have previously been treated with palbociclib. The FDA has not approved avelumab as a treatment for any disease.\n\nPalbociclib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing. Palbociclib blocks activity of two closely related enzymes (proteins that help chemical reactions in the body occur), called Cyclin Dependent Kinases 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6). These proteins are part of a pathway, or a sequence of steps, which is known to promote cancer cell growth. Laboratory testing has shown that palbociclib may stop the growth of hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Palbociclib is FDA-approved as therapy for metastatic hormone receptor positive HER2 negative breast cancer in combination with endocrine therapy in the first line setting, and in combination with fulvestrant for pre-treated disease. It is not known whether cancers that have grown despite prior palbociclib treatment are still sensitive to palbociclib.\n\nEndocrine therapy prevents growth of hormone receptor positive breast cancer by blocking stimulation of cancer cells by estrogen. During this study, the endocrine therapy will be fulvestrant. Fulvestrant is a drug that is approved by the FDA for treatment of metastatic hormone receptor positive breast cancer.\n\nThe immune system is the body's natural defense against disease. The immune system sends a type of cells called T cells throughout the body to detect and fight infections and diseases-including cancers. One way the immune system controls the activity of T cells is through the PD-1 (programmed cell death protein-1) pathway. However, some cancer cells hide from T-cell attack by taking control of the PD-1 pathway and this stops T cells from attacking cancer cells.\n\nAvelumab is an antibody designed to block the PD-1 pathway and helps the immune system in detecting and fighting cancer cells. An antibody is a protein produced by the body's immune system when it detects harmful substances. Previous studies show that the administration of antibodies which block the PD-1 pathway can lead to tumor destruction.\n\nIn the laboratory, adding avelumab to fulvestrant and palbociclib appears to improve effectiveness. It is not known whether this is true in humans",

When a cancer has gotten so big it can't easily be removed or has spread to other parts of the body, it is called unresectable. These types of cancer are harder to treat.\n\nPatients in this study must have cancer that has come back or did not get better with treatment.

PF-08052666/SGN-MesoC2 is a type of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them. They may also stick to some normal cells.\n\nThis study will have 3 parts.

Antispasmodics, antidepressants and hypnotherapy have all been proposed for the treatment of pain. Their effectiveness in clinical practice is disappointing, despite meta-analyses suggesting efficacy. The study hypotheses are: that rimegepant will be safe, well-tolerated, and will improve abdominal pain in participants with non-constipation IBS. The primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of rimegepant on abdominal pain scores in participants with non-constipation IBS. Secondary aims of this study are:\n\n* 1: To describe the effect of rimegepant on rectal compliance in participants with IBS and chronic abdominal pain.\n* 2: To evaluate the effects of rimegepant on rectal sensation based on ascending method of limits and on graded rapid phasic distensions in participants with non-constipation IBS and chronic abdominal pain.\n* 3: To evaluate effects of rimegepant on overall colonic transit in participants with non-constipation IBS and chronic abdominal pain.\n* 4: To evaluate safety of rimegepant in participants with non-constipation IBS and chronic abdominal pain Methods: IBS-pain participants will be selected according to the Rome III criteria. Trial participants will continue to receive the same medical therapy throughout the baseline and treatment periods. The study design is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of rimegepant at doses and route of administration approved by the FDA for the prophylaxis of migraine headache.\n\nThe trial period will consist of a two week run-in period, and 4 week treatment period. Participants will complete a daily diary regarding abdominal pain and stool consistency. They will also complete questionnaires studies of anxiety and depression and IBS-QOL.\n\nAn established and validated method using rectal barostat device will be used to measure rectal compliance and sensation. The standard scintigraphic method to measure colonic transit established in the Clinical Research Trials Unit (CRTU) at Mayo Clinic Rochester will be used to evaluate changes in colonic transit.\n\nAnticipated results and Significance: Rimegepant, at doses and mode of administration approved by FDA for the prophylaxis of migraine headache, will be efficacious in the reduction of abdominal pain and rectal sensation in participants with non-constipation IBS and abdominal pain.\n\nThis study will provide an early signal of efficacy that may lead to future randomized, controlled trials.",

Both letrozole and palbociclib are medicines already used for treatment of breast cancer. ARV-471 is a new medicine under study.\n\nThis study is seeking participants who have breast cancer that:\n\n* Have a locally advanced or metastatic disease and cannot be fully cured by surgery or radiation therapy. A metastatic disease is when disease has spread to other parts of the body.\n* Is sensitive to hormonal therapy such as tamoxifen. This is called estrogen receptor positive disease.\n* Have not received any prior medicine for advanced disease. Example medications include tamoxifen or letrozole or exemestane.\n\nThe study will have an open-label SLI (study lead-in) before initiation of Phase 3 trial. During SLI, two dose levels of palbociclib in combination with ARV-471 will be explored in parallel. Assignment to the palbociclib dose is by chance.

Adverse social determinants of health may play a role in these outcome disparities, due to both social barriers in accessing care, and through direct stress-mediated biological effects on the host and tumor microenvironment. Interventions to reduce stress and optimize resilience during treatment of MBC may improve quality of life and even improve disease outcomes; however, feasibility of face-to-face intervention during intensive medical treatment is limited. Thus, this study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a remotely delivered resilience intervention, PRISM, already proven effective in other cancer settings, for MBC patients, and to gather preliminary efficacy data for a future randomized trial.",
    "detailed_description": "Black women with breast cancer have substantially worse survival compared to White counterparts across all stages of presenting disease. Survival from a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to death is shorter for Black compared to non-Black women, with the worst disparity appearing in younger patients.\n\nBlack compared to non-Black MBC patients also report more chronic stressors including social barriers to cancer care, metabolic co-morbidities, and higher likelihood of residing in neighborhoods with adverse social determinants of health (SDOH). These bio-psycho-social factors are potential mechanisms of observed racial gaps in survival of MBC. The adversity experienced by Black patients may impact the outcomes of MBC through social, psychological, and biological mechanisms. Regarding social mechanisms, adverse SDOH may cause patients to have delays in care, miss appointments, defer needed treatment, or tolerate treatment less well due to unmet supportive care or social support needs. Regarding psychological and biological mechanisms, cumulative physiologic stress and distress elevate inflammatory and immune biomarkers and precipitate the development of cardio-metabolic diseases, a phenomenon known as allostatic overload. Black individuals both with and without cancer are more likely to suffer from allostatic overload, and the impact of cancer on allostatic load may be differential by race. While the Black-White gap in breast cancer survival has long been recognized, the relationships among marginalized racial identity, adverse social circumstances, allostatic overload, and breast cancer outcomes remain poorly understood.\n\nStress and Coping Theory posits that the ways in which individuals appraise and cope with stressful experiences are modifiable targets for intervention. In this regard, \"resilience\" is a key construct; it implies an ability to harness resources to sustain well-being in the face of adversity. In breast cancer patients and others with serious illness, skills in stress-management, goal-setting, positive-reframing, and meaning - making are associated with improved stress biology, physical, and mental health. In the context of an advanced cancer diagnosis, resilient individuals may be more able to cope with the challenges of illness, including barriers to care, and in turn experience less incremental stress, and improved quality of life (QOL) and disease outcomes. Such resilience might be particularly beneficial to patients from marginalized groups.\n\nInvestigators of this study have previously developed and demonstrated the efficacy of a targeted intervention promoting resilience in populations of young adults with pediatric cancers and advanced cancers. However, evidence is lacking as to whether such an intervention can be helpful among women with MBC, particularly those from historically marginalized communities. The goal of this study is to test the impacts of a remotely delivered resilience intervention, Promoting Resilience in Stress Management (PRISM), on relevant social, psychological, and biologic outcomes of diverse women with a recent diagnosis of MBC at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC) and the University of Alabama-Birmingham (UAB).",

    "detailed_description": "The long-term survival for malignant pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PHEO/PGL) may be limited because of its hormonal effects as well as its aggressive behavior and dissemination, particularly in some hereditary PHEO/PGL. Although several therapeutic modalities have been used to palliate malignant PHEO/PGL, a continued search for new agents to address the malignancy is needed to improve outcomes. One approach is to utilize drugs that target signaling pathways leading to decreased proliferation and survival of cancer cells. Some data in the literature suggests that in malignant PHEO/PGL, VEGF seems to play a role in the biology of the cancer and thus, its inhibition could reduce tumor growth. Sunitinib and imatinib has been used in a limited number of malignant pheochromocytomas with varying responses. Axitinib was designed to inhibit VEGFR that participates in tumor angiogenesis. In order to determine the activity of axitinib in tumor and hormonal responses in malignant PHEO/PGL, it will be used as a single agent in this study. The combination of cyclophosphamide; vincristine and dacarbazine have been shown to produce partial responses in malignant PHEO/PGL. The majority of the patients may have already received this combination or will receive this combination chemotherapy in the future. The goal is to develop multiple lines of effective treatments for this disease.",

    "brief_summary": "This phase II trial compares the effect of relugolix to leuprolide on cardiac function and performance in patients with prostate cancer. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been a key component for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer for decades. The term androgen deprivation therapy means lowering a man's testosterone. Long-term studies show that ADT may contribute to a detriment to cardiac health and predisposes men to developing cardiac diseases. Recent studies suggest that men taking relugolix for treatment of prostate cancer may have a lower risk of developing cardiovascular problems, but more studies are needed to understand this observation, and there are currently no studies reporting the direct impact of ADT (relugolix, versus the more-commonly used leuprolide) on cardiac function and outcomes.\n\nParticipants will receive definitive radiotherapy for unfavorable intermediate risk prostate cancer and 6-month ADT (either relugolix or leuprolide). In addition, participants will undergo the following:\n\n1. Comprehensive cardiac and exercise testing before and after starting ADT\n2. Completion of quality-of-life questionnaires at specific intervals during the study period\n3. Provide blood samples at specific intervals during the study period to test for changes in steroid levels and certain biomarkers",
    "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To quantify the physiologic alterations in cardiopulmonary function in men receiving 6-month relugolix verse (vs.) 6-month leuprolide with definitive radiation therapy (RT) for unfavorable intermediate risk (UIR) clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa).\n\nII. Cardiopulmonary and cardiac measures obtained from: 1) exercise stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) perfusion, and 2) maximal rate of oxygen consumption (VO2), include myocardial perfusion reserve index (MPRI), contractile reserve, myocardial longitudinal relaxation time (T1) signal, longitudinal strain, circumferential strain, VO2 maximum (max), and metabolic equivalents of exercise capacity (METs).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To quantify the impact of 6-month relugolix vs. leuprolide with definitive RT for UIR PCa on quality of life (QoL) using Expanded Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)-26, European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), European (Euro) Qol-5-Dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L), and Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue (Short Form 8a) patient-reported outcome surveys, or similar tests.\n\nII. To quantify the impact of 6-month relugolix vs. leuprolide on composite functional tests of strength and balance using three tests: 1) Timed Up-and-Go, 2) 10-meter walk time, and 3) grip strength.\n\nIII. To analyze body composition changes in response to 6-month relugolix vs. leuprolide by using abdominal computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantitate abdominal/visceral fat and lean muscle mass with utilization of SliceOmatic software.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare changes in serum steroid profiles (panel of 17 steroid hormone metabolites, Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center \\[OSUCCC Pharmacoanalytic Shared Resource \\[PhASR\\]) before, during and after 6-month relugolix vs. 6-month leuprolide with definitive RT for UIR PCa.\n\nII. To compare changes in cardiometabolic biomarkers in the following three categories: 1) glycemic control parameters (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and connecting \\[C\\]-peptide), 2) lipid profiles (total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein \\[LDL\\], high-density lipoprotein \\[HDL\\], and leptin/adiponectin ratio), 3) markers of the obesity-associated low-grade chronic inflammatory state (CRP, TGF-beta, and IL-6, and novel related immunoregulators), and targeted or non- targeted metabolomics or proteomics (by OSUCCC NPASR and PSR) depending on procurement of additional funds.\n\nIII. To compare the time course of recovery for hormonal and cardiometabolic markers after completion of 6-month relugolix vs. 6-month leuprolide with definitive RT for UIR PCa.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM 1: Patients receive definitive therapy for prostate cancer with ADT (leuprolide via injection once every 3 months, for a total of 6 months) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity and definitive radiotherapy within 90 days of starting ADT. Patients receive gadolinium-based contrast intravenously (IV) and undergo exercise-stress cardiac MRI perfusion and comprehensive exercise physiology testing before starting ADT and at 6 months after starting ADT. Patients also undergo blood and urine sample collection throughout the study, as well as completion of quality-of-life questionnaires.\n\nARM 2: Patients receive definitive therapy for prostate cancer with ADT (relugolix orally once daily for a total of 6 months) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity and definitive radiotherapy within 90 days of starting ADT. Patients receive gadolinium-based contrast intravenously (IV) and undergo exercise-stress cardiac MRI perfusion and comprehensive exercise physiology testing before starting ADT and at 6 months after starting ADT. Patients also undergo blood and urine sample collection throughout the study, as well as completion of quality-of-life questionnaires.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months.",

The participants will go through a round of treatment with CE/BZA. The study will last 16 weeks. The study's objectives are to determine primarily if CE/BZA improves mood among peri- and early postmenopausal women, and secondarily if treatment with CE/BZA improves their sleep.",

    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate how Aztreonam (ATM) and Avibactam (AVI) are processed in pediatric participants. This study also aims to understand participant safety and effects in pediatric participants.\n\nThe study is seeking participants who are:\n\n* 9 months to less than 18 years of age\n* Hospitalized\n* Suspected/known to have a gram-negative infection\n* Receiving intravenous (iv, given directly into a vein) antibiotics\n* Being treated for complicated infections of various body parts that includes the abdomen, urinary tract, blood stream, and lungs.\n* Participants will receive either ATM-AVI or best available therapy (BAT).\n* Both therapies will be given through a vein.\n* Participants with complicated abdominal infections will also receive iv Metronidazole (MTZ). Patients with cIAI and Cockayne Syndrome are excluded due to a risk of severe hepatotoxicity with the use of MTZ. - Participants on ATM-AVI treatment who have anaerobic infections will also receive iv MTZ at the study doctor's discretion.\n* The iv dose of ATM-AVI will be based on the participant's weight and kidney function.\n* The study doctor will determine the iv dose of BAT.\n* During the first 2 study days, participants on ATM-AVI therapy will have 5 blood draws in small quantities.\n* Starting on day 4, the study doctor will decide if participants may be switched to oral therapy.\n* Participants will receive a maximum of 14 days of ATM-AVI treatment.\n* After discharge from the hospital, 1 study visit may be required.\n* Depending on the participant's response, the study duration will be from 33 to 50 days.\n* The investigator will contact participants by phone 28 to 35 days after the last study treatment to check participants health status.",
    "detailed_description": "* Following informed consent, potential participants who are hospitalized, receiving IV antibiotics for less than 24 hours within 48 hours of randomization or failed antibiotic therapy for greater than 48 hours and have suspected/known gram-negative bacterial infections with a complex intra-abdominal infection (cIAI), complex urinary tract (cUTI), blood stream infection (BSI), hospital acquired pneumonia or ventilator associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP) will be screened.\n* Although cultures are required, isolation of the causative pathogen is not a criteria for enrollment. - cUTI participants requiring systemic prophylactic antibiotics for any reason at screening are allowed to enter the study provided they discontinue this medication prior to first study drug dose.\n* If the participant satisfies the inclusion and exclusion requirements, the participant will be randomly enrolled in a ratio of 3 iv ATM-AVI for each iv BAT.\n* A total of 48 participants at approximately 33 sites will be randomized using interactive response technology (IRT).\n* The study will be multicenter, international and open label with a single blinded observer assigned by each investigational site.\n* There will be 4 cohorts with ages 12 to less than 18 years (Cohort 1), 6 to less than 12 years (Cohort 2), 2 to less than 6 years (Cohort 3) and 9 months to less than 2 years (Cohort 4).\n* Each cohort will have 12 participants for a total of 48 participants.\n* Cohorts 1 and 2 will be enrolled simultaneously. - - Cohort 3 will begin enrollment after the first 4 participants complete Cohort 2 and PK data and safety have been reviewed by the sponsor and an external data monitoring committee (DMC). Then ATM-AVI dose may be adjusted as needed.\n* Cohort 4 will begin enrollment after the first 4 participants completed Cohort 3 and the PK data have been reviewed by the sponsor and the DMC. Then the ATM-AVI dose may be adjusted as needed.\n* After 4 participants complete Cohort 4 the PK data will be review by the sponsor and DMC and then the ATM-AVI dose may be adjusted as needed.\n* Enrollment will not be paused during the PK data reviews of the first 4 ATM-AVI participants in a cohort. If the ATM-AVI dose requires adjustment, the cohort 4 number will be increased to 20 with 15 receiving ATM-AVI and 5 BAT.\n* All participants in the ATM-AVI group will receive an initial ATM-AVI loading dose and then maintenance doses every 6 or 8 hours depending on the participant's weight and kidney function.\n* ATM-AVI will be infused over 3 hours.\n* Those with cIAI will receive metronidazole (MTZ). Patients with cIAI and Cockayne Syndrome are excluded due to a risk of severe hepatotoxicity with the use of MTZ. - At the investigator's discretion MTZ will be administered to those with BSI, cUTI or HAP/VAP and an associated anaerobic infection.\n* MTZ will be administered iv over 20 to 30 minutes starting.\n* Optional gram-positive coverage with vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid is permitted. Daptomycin is only permitted for cIAI and BSI participants.\n* Coverage with iv aminoglycoside is permitted for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n* Concerning concomitant medications, participants with cUTI may not take prophylactic therapy during study drug treatment.\n* Systemic antibiotics are not permitted unless the study drug failed, or it is for a remote site infection essential for participant's safety.\n* Systemic iv antivirals are permitted.\n* Systemic antifungals should be avoided unless indicated.\n* Meropenem/carbapenem-type antibiotics cannot be given concomitantly with ATM-AVI.\n* Probenecid and inhaled antibiotics are to be avoided from informed consent until the end of iv treatment (EOIV).\n* Antibiotic peritoneal lavage is not permitted. Non-antibiotic lavage is permitted.\n* The primary endpoints are pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety.\n* Five PK micro-blood samples of at least 0.1 mL will be drawn. The initial 2 PK micro blood samples will be drawn at 2 hours and 5 hours after the first infusion. The next 3 PK micro-blood samples will be drawn at 15 minutes before, 5 hours and 5 3/4 hours after the 5th infusion or a later infusion.\n* ATM and AVI clearance (CL), maximum (Cmax) and minimum (Cmin) venous blood concentration, area under the curve (AUC) and half-life (t1/2) will be analyzed.\n* A blinded observer (BO), assigned by each investigational site, will clinically assess the participants every day.\n* The BO will evaluate causality of all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) while the participant is in the hospital, within 24 hours of the end of iv study drug (EOIV), and within 48 hours of end of treatment for those switched to oral therapy.\n* For the secondary endpoint of efficacy, the BO will clinically assess the test of cure (TOC) within 7 to 14 days of the last antibiotic treatment. Potential for liver function abnormalities and acute kidney injury will be specifically monitored in addition to standard of care assessments.\n* Cure is defined as signs and symptoms improved with no further antimicrobial treatment required except for adjunctive gram-positive therapy or for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n* In addition, for cIAI participants, no unplanned drainage or surgical intervention is necessary since the initial surgical procedure. Only for those switched to oral therapy before 14 days, improvement is afebrile with absence of new signs or symptoms and improvement of 1 or more symptoms or signs with no worsening of signs or symptoms.\n* Failure is defined as death, requirement of antibiotics for the index infection, or discontinuation due to an AE(s). cIAI participants have additional failure criteria of requiring surgical intervention and/or have an infected post-surgical wound(s).\n* Participant may choose to permanently discontinue and are free to discontinue treatment without further treatment prejudice. Possible reasons for permanent discontinuation are:\n* Condition under investigation resolved prior to minimum treatment period\n* AE or any other condition posing a risk to a participant or jeopardizing safety\n* Investigator, national coordinators, medical monitor, and/or Sponsor decided it is in the best interest of the participant's safety\n* Positive pregnancy test during the treatment period\n* Absence of explanation for liver injury and/or increase in liver function tests or acute kidney toxicity\n* Discontinuation of intervention does not represent withdrawal from the study and participants should remain in the study until the end of the study (EOS).",

    "brief_summary": "This study is being done to see if tucatinib with ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) works better than T-DM1 alone to help patients who have a specific type of breast cancer called HER2 positive breast carcinoma. The breast cancer in this study is either metastatic (spread into other parts of the body) or cannot be removed completely with surgery.\n\nPatients in this study will be randomly assigned to get either tucatinib or placebo (a pill with no medicine). This is a blinded study, so neither patients nor their doctors will know whether a patient gets tucatinib or placebo. All patients in the study will get T-DM1, a drug that is often used to treat this cancer.\n\nEach treatment cycle lasts 21 days. Patients will swallow tucatinib pills or placebo pills two times every day. Patients will get T-DM1 injections from the study site staff on the first day of every cycle.",
    "detailed_description": "This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tucatinib in combination with T-DM1 in participants with unresectable locally-advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer who have had prior treatment with a taxane and trastuzumab in any setting. Prior pertuzumab treatment is permitted, but not required. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to receive 21-day cycles of either tucatinib or placebo in combination with T-DM1.\n\nWhile on study treatment, participants will be assessed for progression every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks, and every 9 weeks thereafter, irrespective of dose holds or interruptions. Study treatment will continue until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, withdrawal of consent, or study closure. After completion of study treatment and after occurrence of disease progression, participants in both arms of the study will continue to be followed for survival until study closure or withdrawal of consent.",
