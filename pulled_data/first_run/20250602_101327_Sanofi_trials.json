    "detailed_description": "This study aims to develop treatments that enhance respiratory strength and function to provide meaningful clinical improvements for people with LOPD. Identification of a cost-effective adjunctive intervention to address respiratory weakness remains critical to reduce disease burden, ease activity limitations and participation restrictions, and improve health-related quality of life. The proposed study will provide a high-dose inspiratory muscle training (IMT) stimulus to enhance treatment efficacy and efficiency. Our hypothesis is that high-dose IMT is necessary to produce meaningful changes in respiratory muscle strength and other outcomes in participants with LOPD.",

Participants with prior therapy with anti-CD38 and anti-B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) target except an anti-BCMA T cell engager (TCE) may be eligible.\n\nThis research is being done to see if the study drugs, elranatamab and isatuximab-irfc, reduce the risk of worsening disease and to evaluate the possible risks of the study drugs. Elranatamab is an FDA approved treatment for RRMM. Isatuximab is FDA approved as a treatment option for RRMM when administered intravenously (IV), however isatuximab will be administered as a subcutaneous (SC) infusion (injected under the skin) in this study which is not FDA approved and is investigational. Isatuximab will be administered subcutaneously using an investigational device called the on-body delivery system. The first six patients who complete Cycles 1 and 2 will be assessed for safety and adverse events prior to enrolling all other patients. The research involves screening for eligibility, study treatment and study visits, and follow-up visits. In the beginning (Day 1) of Cycle 1, there may be a 2-8 day inpatient visit so participants can be monitored during their first dose of isatuximab + elranatamab. Participants will receive study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal, and will be followed every 3 months for 5 years after their final dose.",

    "brief_summary": "The goal of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the effectiveness of two innovative interventions aimed at preventing cognitive decline and work-related problems to enhanced usual care in improving quality of life in people with multiple sclerosis. Secondary objectives are:\n\n* to compare the effectiveness of the investigated interventions in improving cognitive, psychological, and work functioning, and in enhancing the brain's functional network\n* to examine which factors (i.e., baseline cognitive, psychological, work, and brain MRI-parameters) are predictive of the response to the investigated interventions\n* aim to qualitatively reflect on the process and outcome of the investigated interventions considering the perspectives of relevant stakeholders to allow for smooth and successful implementation in clinical practice\n\nParticipants will follow the intervention for four months, with follow-up measurements at six months after intervention and 12 months after intervention.",
    "detailed_description": "Background Up to 65% of the people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) develop cognitive deficits that severely affect daily life functioning and PwMS' quality of life. Moreover, approximately 65% of all patients end up unemployed within five years after diagnosis. Current treatments mostly focus on symptom management and return to work, which may be too late. It is hypothesized that timely interventions will help prevent or delay cognitive decline and work-related problems in PwMS, thereby improving quality of life.\n\nObjectives\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo compare the effectiveness of the investigated interventions with enhanced usual care in improving quality of life.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. To compare the effectiveness of the investigated interventions in improving cognitive, psychological and work functioning, and in enhancing the brain's functional network.\n2. To examine which factors (i.e. baseline cognitive, psychological, work and brain MRI-parameters) are predictive of the response to the investigated interventions.\n3. To qualitatively reflect on the process and outcome of the investigated interventions considering the perspectives of relevant stakeholders to allow for smooth and successful implementation in clinical practice.\n4. To compare the cost-effectiveness of the investigated interventions.\n\nMaterial and methods A randomized controlled trial with three arms and three follow-up visits over a total time period of 16 months. During these visits researchers will gather information from questionnaires, neuropsychological examination, MRI and blood sampling. All participants (N= 240) have a confirmed MS diagnosis according to the McDonald 2017 criteria, have subclinical cognitive impairment and are aged between 18 and 67. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three arms (N=90 in each arm). Interviews will be conducted with 12-15 participants from both interventions, 10-12 sport coaches, 8-12 work coaches and 10-12 supervisors from the workplace.\n\n'Strengthening the brain' (4 month-program) consists of weekly 30 minutes 1-on-1 exercise and lifestyle coaching in combination with two moments per week unsupervised exercises at home and a home-based online computerized cognitive training. 'Strengthening the mind' (4 month-program) consists of biweekly contact with work coaches who are all diagnosed with MS themselves. 'Enhanced usual care' entails an appointment with a researcher in addition to usual care.\n\nResults The primary outcome is change in quality of life as measured with the 36-item Short Form. Several secondary outcomes will be collected: cognitive, psychological, cost-effectiveness, structural- and functional brain, neurological, physiological, and qualitative measures.",

Once tumors have grown bigger in one place but haven't spread, they're called locally advanced. If your cancer has spread to other parts of your body, it's called metastatic. When a cancer has gotten so big it can't easily be removed or has spread to other parts of the body, it is called unresectable. These types of cancer are harder to treat.\n\nParticipants in this study must have cancer that has come back or did not get better with treatment. Participants must have a solid tumor cancer that can't be treated with standard of care drugs.\n\nThis clinical trial uses an experimental drug called PF-08046050. PF-08046050 is a type of antibody-drug conjugate or ADC. ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them. They may also stick to some normal cells.\n\nThis study will test the safety of PF-08046050 in participants with solid tumors that are hard to treat or have spread throughout the body.\n\nThis study has 5 different study parts. Part A and Part B of the study will find out how much PF-08046050 should be given to participants. Part C will use the information from Parts A and B to see if PF-08046050 is safe and if it works to treat certain solid tumor cancers. Part D of the study, together with information from Parts A and B, will find out how much PF-08046050 should be given to participants in combination with bevacizumab. Part E will use the information from Parts A, B, and D to see if PF-08046050 is safe in combination with bevacizumab and if it works to treat a certain solid tumor.",

Recent surveillance data and an increase in the number of pertussis outbreaks being reported nationally, indicate an increase in the incidence of pertussis disease in South Africa.To date there is no data on the effect of vaccinating HIV-infected pregnant women with pertussis-containing vaccines, although there is no reason to think that vaccinating these women would be harmful for them or their foetus. The knowledge gaps on the immunogenicity, safety and VE of pertussis vaccination of HIV-infected pregnant women should be addressed.

However, the pregnancy follow-up relies in part on the visual investigation by ultrasound scanners that estimate the risks of morbi-mortality for the mother and child during and after pregnancy. The WHO recommendations support at least one ultrasound before 24 weeks of amenorrhea. Thus, at the same time as a usual clinical examination, the possibility of visually assessing certain relevant criteria would help to increase the effectiveness of follow-up visits without complicating the care journey. A simple ultra-portable device would be an opportunity for caregivers to facilitate the detection of complications and thus offer a more adapted follow-up and orientation.\n\nThis would allow, in contexts where resources are limited, to improve monitoring and limit the risks of complications due to inappropriate management.",

Through this protocol, the investigators propose a pilot study to evaluate, under field conditions, the performance of the echOpen O1 probe as part of the 3rd-trimester pregnancy monitoring, compared to a standard ultrasound examination, routinely performed with an ultrasound machine.\n\nThe main objective of this prospective pilot study is to evaluate the performance and operationality of the echOpen O1 probe from the 37th week of amenorrhea.\n\nThe secondary objectives are :\n\n* To evaluate the feasibility and usability of the echOpen O1 probe in the context of pregnancy monitoring by midwives and in zone field conditions:\n\n  * One urban health center (Centralized)\n  * One rural health center (Decentralized)\n* Assess women's quality of life during pregnancy and obtain satisfaction with echOpen O1 probe.",

Investigators want to understand how adding a medication called dupilumab to their usual treatment affects inflammation in their upper and lower airways over 24 weeks.\n\nDupilumab works by blocking certain signals in the immune system that contribute to inflammation in both the sinuses and the lungs. By studying how this medication changes the immune profiles of both airway systems, investigators hope to learn more about the underlying causes of airway inflammation in these conditions.\n\nThis research is important because it may help understand if treating inflammation in one part of the airway (like the lungs) has a similar effect on inflammation in another part (like the sinuses). This could lead to better treatments for people with CRSwNP and asthma, targeting the root causes of their symptoms more effectively.",

Determining the molecular profiles of the upper and lower airways after dupilumab treatment has not been studied yet.\n\nDupilumab has demonstrated effectiveness in treating both Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP) and asthma, conditions characterized by Type 2 inflammation, by inhibiting the IL-4 and IL-13 signalling pathways. However, it remains unclear how immunological changes occur in paired tissues of the upper (sinus) and lower (lung) airways in patients treated with biologics compared to those receiving standard therapies. Additionally, it is not well understood whether improvements in one airway system (e.g., the lungs) are mirrored in the other (e.g., the sinuses), which could result in differing clinical responses. This study aims to address these gaps by examining the comparative effects of Dupilumab versus standard treatments on both airway systems, to determine if therapeutic effects are consistently observed across both systems and to understand the potential implications for clinical responsiveness.",

It brings together individuals with deep clinical and scientific expertise in allergic diseases, including epidemiology, genetics, inflammation, and tolerance mechanisms to investigate, in a coordinated strategy, the hypothesis that the IL-4R\u03b1-R576 variant drives TH2/TH17 cell inflammation by subverting allergen-specific iTreg cells into TH17 cells. Asthmatics bearing this endotype will be particularly likely to favorably respond to Dupilumab therapy by virtue of its prevention of iTreg cell reprogramming into TH17-like cells, potentially leading to their long-term stability and potential for sustained immune tolerance.",

Two 4.5 mm biopsies will be performed at Baseline: one from a keloid lesion and one from an adjacent non-lesional area. Non-lesional biopsies will mimic nascent trauma (e.g. surgery, or other inflammatory processes) and evaluate the effectiveness of dupilumab in preventing new keloid lesion formation.\n\nSubjects will return for visits at weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 28, 36, 48, and 52 following study treatment initiation for repeat clinical assessments (number, location, and measurements via tonometer and calipers), medication reviews, blood and biopsy collection, surveys, and monitoring for adverse events. At week 24 a second lesional biopsy will be performed (from the same keloid area biopsy at baseline, but away from the previous biopsy scar), and at week 48 both a lesional (again from the same keloid, but away from prior biopsies) and a non-lesional biopsy will be performed. Bloods will be done at baseline, week 4, week 16, week 24, week 48. The biopsy sites as well as other lesional areas will be monitored at each subsequent visit by clinical assessment (number, location and measurements via tonometer and calipers) and standardized clinical photography.",

A similar activity and a favorable safety administration profile compared to the IV formulation, was shown in this trial, as expected (Moreau et al, ASH 2021; Quach et al, ASCO 2022). This data should be confirmed in the ongoing IRAKLIA/EFC15951 phase 3 study, that compared in the RRMM, isatuximab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone IV versus SC. Whether isatuximab SC, fixed 1400 mg dose, will show similar efficacy and safety profile as to anti-CD38Rd+V remains to be demonstrated. The investigators have planned to study the combination of SC isatuximab plus VRd (IsVRd) in patients with NDMM NTE in a phase 2 study across IFM (Intergroupe Francophone du Myeloma) centers in France to compare indirectly this data to the data obtained from studies that have studied this association in that population with the IV isatuximab formulation.",

NK cells are a type of white blood cell that are known to spontaneously attack cancer cells. TiNK are NK cells made in a laboratory to have a higher response to tumor cells. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as molecules that cause the body to make an immune response (antigens). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as isatuximab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Patients also receive standard treatment (cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone) on this trial. Cyclophosphamide is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It works by damaging the cell's DNA and may kill cancer cells. It may also lower the body's immune response. Dexamethasone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It is used to reduce inflammation and lower the body's immune response to help lessen the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Giving TiNK and isatuximab with standard treatment may be a safe and effective treatment for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.",

Investigators further hypothesize that rifapentine will be safe and well-tolerated in HIV-infected and uninfected children who require treatment for LTBI.",
    "detailed_description": "Design: Tuberculosis Trials Consortium Study 35 (TBTC S35) is a Phase I/II, open-label, single arm, exposure-controlled dose finding study using an adaptive design. S35 will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of rifapentine given in a new fixed dose combination once-weekly, in combination with isoniazid for 12 weeks, in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children aged 0-12 years in whom LTBI treatment is indicated. The study utilizes a modified age de-escalation approach given the extensive PK and safety data already available in children older than 2 years of age. The protocol allows for parallel enrolment of children into cohorts 1 and 2, simultaneously, using a predetermined modeled initial dose for each cohort, separately. Similarly, cohorts 3 and 4 will be enrolled in parallel, using modeled doses for each cohort, based on data from cohorts 1 and 2 and historical data from TBTC trials.\n\nSample Size: Approximately 72 participants will be required to ensure a minimum number of 60 evaluable participants.\n\nParticipants will be enrolled in 4 age cohorts:\n\nCohort 1: \u2265 4 to \u2264 12 years Cohort 2: \u2265 24 months to \\< 4 years Cohort 3: \u2265 12 to \\< 24 months Cohort 4: 0 to \\<12 months\n\nThere will be a minimum of 12 participants each in cohorts 1 and 2, and 18 participants each in cohorts 3 and 4, to allow for 36 participants in the age group below 2 years, given the importance of developmental pharmacology in this youngest age group (Table 1) and the lack of historical data in this age group. Cohorts 3 and 4 will be enrolled once week 1 PK and safety data is available in cohorts 1 and 2.\n\nUp to 18 HIV-infected children overall will be enrolled, with a target of 12 HIV-infected children overall. It is expected that most HIV-infected children will be \\> 3 years of age given current international recommendations regarding the use of efavirenz in children in international settings, where the study will be conducted. However, it is expected that integrase inhibitors (e.g. raltegravir) would become more routinely available during the study period, allowing younger HIV-infected children to also be enrolled on study.\n\nPopulation: HIV-infected and uninfected children aged 0-12 years who could benefit from chemotherapy for LTBI to prevent the development of active tuberculosis, who have documented close recent exposure to a bacteriologically positive drug sensitive adult pulmonary TB source case, or who have proof of M. tuberculosis infection. HIV-infected children will be established on anti-retroviral therapy for at least 12 weeks prior to enrolment.\n\nSites:\n\nTBTC Site 33, Desmond Tutu TB Centre, Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Stellenbosch University, South Africa TBTC Site 34, Baragwaneth, Perinatal HIV Research Unit (PHRU), Wits Health Consortium, Soweto, Johannesburg, South Africa\n\nStudy Duration: Child participants will be on study for a total of 24 weeks, including a 12-week rifapentine and isoniazid dosing period, with an additional follow-up period of 12 weeks. The overall study accrual period will be approximately 18 months and the total study duration will be approximately 36 months.\n\nDescription of Agent or Intervention:\n\nParticipants will receive 12 once-weekly doses of water-dispersible rifapentine and isoniazid; the initial rifapentine dose in each age cohort will be determined based on historical population models and will be adjusted as data become available in paediatric cohorts in this study. Cohorts 1 and 2 will open up with a pre-selected modeled dose. Dose selection for cohorts 3 and 4 will be modeled from data emerging from cohorts 1 and 2 and historical data. Doses in cohorts will be adjusted as required based on interim PK and safety analyses. Isoniazid will be given at doses of up to 25 mg/kg, once weekly, in combination with pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) 25 mg/kg.",

After ASTC, patients will start consolidation which will be 2 cycles of similar treatment to induction.\n\nContinuous treatment will follow after consolidation and patients will receive:\n\n* arm A: Lenalidomide and monthly Isatuximab until progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal, loss to follow up or death. During continuous treatment, dexamethasone 40 mg is used as a standardized premedication for Isatuximab.\n* arm B: after 6 cycles of induction VRD, ASCT and two consolidation VRDs, treatment continues with 10 additional cycles of VRD. During the extension cycles, VRD changes the bortezomib and dexamethasone regimen. In these10 cycles, both bortezomib and dexamethasone will be administered, at the same doses as the previous ones, but on a weekly schedule, on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each cycle. The lenalidomide regimen remains unchanged.\n* arm C: Iberdomide and monthly Isatuximab until progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal, loss to follow up or death. During continuous treatment, dexamethasone 40 mg is used as a standardized premedication for Isatuximab.\n\nThe primary objective is to compare the efficacy of extended VRD + ASCT plus ERI (Arm B) vs. Isatuximab-VRD + ASCT (Arm A) in terms of proportion of patients who are MRD-negative by next generation flow cytometry (NGF) after 18 cycles + ASCT.\n\nThe primary endpoint, the MRD rate, takes as a reference the evaluation after the last extended VRD cycle, this is: 6 cycles for induction, 6 months for transplantation, 2 cycles for consolidation and 10 cycles until completing the 18 cycles of VRD, (in total about 24 months). For this reason,the primary endpoint in Arms A and C are established after a similar treatment time, which includes 4 cycles of induction, ASCT, 2 cycles of consolidation and 12 cycles of continuous treatment with Iberdomide plus Isatuximab (Dexamethasone to be determined).In patients of Arm B included in ERI, due to the great variability of the possible moments of incorporation in this therapeutic program, only rules are established for the moment and the realization or not of the transplant. The evaluation of the results will be carried out separately in the patients included, butalso in conjunction with the rest of the patients in Arm B to know the effect of the global strategy.\n\nAfter the evaluation of the primary endpoint, continuous/maintenance treatment continues in Arms A, B and C, including patients in ARM B assigned to the ERI program. Obtaining conventional CR in either arm will require a BM analysis for MRD. In the case of stable response or improvement without RC, MRD controls have been pre-established. Due to the lack of data on tolerance and adherence to long-term treatment with Isatuximab and Iberdomide, changes in the therapeutic programs, for this reason, a complete revision of the therapeutic program has been predetermined at the moment in which the last patient included in the clinical trial reaches 36 months of treatment. At this point, taking into account the updated knowledge about continuous or maintenance treatments, the strategies for a second clinical trial or an extension of this clinical trial will be defined.",

The investigational products of this study are cemiplimab (PD1 inhibitor) and isatuximab (anti-CD38 antibody).\n\nThe rationale for the use of cemiplimab in patients with NK/T-cell lymphoid malignancy is the aforementioned PD-L1 expression in tumor cells of ENKTL and ANKL. In addition, the proven efficacy of pembrolizumab in relapsed or refractory ENKTL support the use of PD1 inhibitor as a salvage therapy for this disorder.\n\nThe addition of isatuximab to cemiplimab might induce synergistic activity because CD38-mediated immunosuppression as a mechanism of tumor cell escape from PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Furthermore, targeting CD38 by isatuximab can preferentially block immunosuppressive regulatory T-cells and thereby restore immune effector function against multiple myeloma. These functions of CD38 blocking antibody might help to improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor such as PD1 inhibitor.\n\nGiven the presence of antibody-mediated cytotoxicity and direct anti-tumor effect of isatuximab against CD38-positive tumor cells, the combination of isatuximab with cemiplimab might show the synergistic activity resulting more improved treatment outcome than PD1 inhibitor alone.\n\nThus, The investigators designed a phase II study of cemiplimab and isatuximab for patients with relapsed or refractory ENKTL and ANKL. In this study, The investigators analyze the efficacy of this novel combination and their adverse effects.",
    "detailed_description": "This clinical trial is a study that uses two antibodies called 'Isatuximab' and 'Cemiplemab' as a rescue anticancer therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory'NK/T cell lymphoma'.\n\nCemiplimab is an antibody against the PD1 protein of cytotoxic T cells. By inhibiting the binding of the PDL1 protein expressed on the surface of tumor cells, cancer cells use the PDL1 protein expressed on the surface of their cells to the tumor immune function It works to prevent getting involved.\n\nWhen the interaction between PD1 and PDL1 protein is suppressed in this way, T cells in human's body attack and kill cancer cells, and cancer cells are killed through this process.\n\nTo date, immuno-cancer drugs that inhibit the interaction of PD1 and PDL1 proteins have already been developed other than Cemiplimab, and have proven excellent therapeutic effects in lung cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\nTherefore, the investigators have started this clinical trial because Cemiplimab, one of the immuno-cancer drugs, is expected to be effective in the 'NK/T cell lymphoma' that you have been diagnosed with. However, the effect of Cemiplimab in the disease has not yet been proven, and a research report has recently been published that other anticancer drugs that inhibit the PD1 protein may be effective in'extralymphatic NK/T cell lymphoma'.\n\nHowever, this is not conclusive because it is a study involving a small number of patients.\n\nHowever, if this clinical trial proves that cemiplimab is effective in 'NK/T cell lymphoma', it could contribute to the development of new treatments for this disease. In addition, all of the previous studies have studied the therapeutic effect using only a single antibody that inhibits the PD1 protein, but in this study, an antibody against the CD38 antigen called isatuximab is used together. The CD38 antigen is expressed in several hematocrit cells, and in multiple myeloma, antibodies to CD38 are already used as standard treatments for relapsed or refractory diseases. However, the high frequency of expression of CD38 antigen on the surface of tumor cells of NK/T cell lymphoma is expected as a therapeutic target, but its therapeutic effect has not yet been proven. Istuximab used in this study is an antibody targeting CD38, and can be expected to kill tumor cells expressing CD38, so when administered in combination with cemiplimab, its therapeutic effect can be increased. In this study, patients diagnosed and treated as'NK/T cell lymphoma' but did not reach cure and the disease worsened, or patients who experienced a cure but later recurred. The investigators want to evaluate the effectiveness.\n\nThrough this, the goal is to improve the prognosis by discovering a new treatment that is ultimately effective for the treatment of relapsed or refractory 'NK/T cell lymphoma.'",

Patients will be classified at diagnosis according to cytogenetics (standard vs high-risk cytogenetics defined by the LP score including 17p deletion, t(4;14), del(1p32), gain 1q, trisomy 21 and trisomy 5).",
    "detailed_description": "According to international guidelines, outside clinical trials, frontline autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is the standard of care for fit patients less than 71 years of age, who are newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma.\n\nTriplet combinations are now the backbone of induction therapy prior to ASCT. KRD (Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, Dexamethasone) is potentially the more active regimen.\n\nQuadruplet combinations are under evaluation. The prospective phase 3 CASSIOPEIA trial conducted by the IFM and HOVON cooperative groups investigated the outcome of transplant-eligible patients treated with VTD (Bortezomib, Thalidomide, Dexamethasone) +/- Daratumumab administered both before (induction, 4 cycles) and after (consolidation, 2 cycles) single ASCT prepared by Melphalan 200 mg/m2.5 The addition of Daratumumab to VTD during induction induced significantly higher response rates, but also higher minimal residual disease (MRD) - negativity rates. The high response rates achieved after induction (MRD negativity rates at 10-5 by 8-color flow cytometry 35% (188/543) in the VTD-Dara arm vs 23% (125/542) after 4 cycles of VTD in the intent-to-treat population), but also after consolidation and before maintenance (MRD negativity rates at 10-5 by 8-color flow cytometry 63% in the VTD-Dara arm vs 43% in the VTD in the intent-to-treat population), translated into a significant improvement in progression-free-survival (PFS) in the Daratumumab arm of the study: 18-month PFS 93% vs 85% before maintenance, HR 0.47 (0.33-0.67), p \\< 0.0001. Cassiopeia is the first study showing a correlation between MRD negativity after induction (before ASCT) and PFS benefit, in the setting of quadruplet combination induction. Based on these results, VTD + daratumumab was recently approved by the FDA and EMA.\n\nKRD has also been combined with Daratumumab in several phase 2 trials. Early results indicate that this quadruplet combination might potentially be the most effective regimen prior to ASCT in terms of response and MRD-negativity rates. Carfilzomib was administered intravenously weekly, on days 1, 8 and 15 of 28 day-cycles at the dose of 56 mg/m\u00b2. Based on 70 patients, the MRD-negativity rate after four cycles of KRD-Daratumumab was 39% at a detection level of 10-5 by next generation sequencing (NGS). The weekly KRD-Daratumumab regimen was associated with low toxicity, and stem cell harvest was adequate. The rate of MRD negativity in 42 patients further improved after single ASCT, to 67% and 43% at a detection level of 10-5 and of 10-6 by NGS, respectively. Due to the short 7.9 months median follow-up time at the time of presentation, no PFS data were presented. At ASCO 2020, Weisel et al reported the results of induction based on 6 cycles of KRD plus Isatuximab, in patients with high-risk cytogenetics.8 In this interim analysis on the first 46 patients eligible for ASCT with high-risk disease, the overall response rate was 100%, including 60% MRD negativity at 10-5 by NGS after induction and before ASCT. No death on study was reported. No data are yet available regarding MRD negativity rates after ASCT or PFS. At ASH 2019, Landgren et al. reported the results of eight weekly KRD-Daratumumab cycles without ASCT in a small phase 2 study on 41 patients after a short median follow-up time of 8.6 months.\n\nOn the same intent-to-treat basis, MRD-negativity rate at a detection level of 10-5 by NGS was 61% and 65% in patients after six and eight cycles, respectively, including a very good partial response (VGPR) rate or better of 85% after 8 cycles and an overall response rate (ORR) of 100%. No death on study was seen. At the time of the report, no patient with MRD-negative disease had progressed. Despite the short follow-up time, based on the high rate of MRD-negativity and the 0% relapse rate achieved so far with this quadruplet combination, the authors of this small phase 2 series now propose to systematically delay ASCT in patients with standard-risk disease. This provocative recommendation requires validation in a phase 3 randomized trial comparing frontline versus delayed ASCT in patients with MRD-negative disease after induction.\n\nPatients MRD positive after quadruplet induction are at higher risk of disease progression. For patients with high-risk (HR) disease, tandem ASCT has been proposed in order to improve PFS and overall survival (OS). In an integrated analysis of four phase III studies independently conducted by HOVON/GMMG, IFM, PETHEMA/GEM and GIMEMA European cooperative groups, in the era of Bortezomib-based induction regimens, double ASCT significantly improved PFS and OS in HR patients.\n\nIn the EMN02/HO95 study, in centers with a policy of double ASCT, patients were assigned to receive VMP (Bortezomib, Melphalan, Prednisone), single ASCT (ASCT-1) or two planned ASCTs (ASCT-2) to prospectively compare ASCT-1 with ASCT-2. Patients who received ASCT-2 had a prolonged PFS compared to those who received ASCT-1. Importantly, ASCT-2 overcame the adverse prognosis conferred by high-risk cytogenetics. In the same study, OS from the first randomization was significantly prolonged with ASCT-2 as compared with ASCT-1, a benefit also seen in subgroups of patients with adverse prognosis, including those with R-ISS stage II+III and high-risk cytogenetics. To date, no prospective trial has compared single vs tandem ASCT in HR patients in the era of quadruplet induction combinations.\n\nAfter ASCT, a systematic maintenance is recommended by International Guidelines. Lenalidomide is approved in this setting, and proposed until progression. Other agents or combinations are under evaluation for maintenance, such as Ixazomib, Elotuzumab, Daratumumab or Isatuximab. Iberdomide is a next generation cereblon targeting agent, with antitumor and immunostimulatory activities in Lenalidomide- and Pomalidomide-resistant multiple myeloma. This oral agent, which could be the ideal agent for maintenance therapy, is currently tested after ASCT. Phase 2 and 3 randomized studies are currently investigating the combination of Lenalidomide with anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies as maintenance therapy after autologous stem cell transplant. We assume that a fixed duration of maintenance using Iberdomide and Isatuximab will induce a high-rate of sustained MRD negativity.",

    "detailed_description": "This study is a prospective, multicenter Phase II study of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for previously untreated patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Severe Aplastic Anemia (SAA) is a rare condition in which the body stops producing enough new blood cells. Patients with aplastic anemia have low white blood cells (cells which fight infection), low red blood cells (cells that carry oxygen throughout the body), and low platelets (cells that help form clots and prevent bleeding). Treatments for SAA seeks to repair this abnormal immune system attack and allow the bone marrow to make the normal amount of blood cells. This can be done with a bone marrow transplant or with medications to suppress the immune system.\n\nHistorically, transplant therapy for SAA has been reserved for patients under 40 years old who had an available fully matched related donor. The standard treatment for older patients with SAA and patients who do not have a fully matched related donor has been treatment using transfusions, medications that suppress the immune system (immunosuppressive therapy, IST), and medications that try to stimulate the bone marrow to produce more cells. For these patients, transplant was used only if a patient did not respond to these interventions. However, progress has made transplantation safer and allowed for half-matched related donor or full or partially-matched unrelated donors to be used with success rates similar to fully matched related donors in many situations. The goals of this study are to determine if patients with SAA who have not received previous treatment for SAA can be treated effectively with transplant as their first SAA therapy.\n\nThis is a parallel cohort study comprised of two cohorts based on donor selection: haploidentical related donors and unrelated donors. The accrual goal is 30 participants enrolled and starting protocol-specified conditioning in each cohort, yielding 60 participants in total. Participants will be treated with a reduced-intensity preparative regimen of fludarabine (150 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (29 mg/kg), low dose total body irradiation (TBI, 400 cGy), and Thymoglobulin\u00ae (4.5 mg/kg). Bone marrow will be collected from donors and fresh (not cryopreserved) cells will be given to patients. GVHD prophylaxis will be with post-HSCT cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg), tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). All patients will receive the same conditioning regimen and GVHD prophylaxis. Participants will be followed for 1 year post-transplant.",

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as isatuximab, may induce changes in the body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Carfilzomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone and lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

A multivariate analysis using the Cox model will also be used.\n\nAn Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) composed of international experts (at least 2 physicians and 1 statistician) will be selected.\n\nFor safety purpose, the IDMC will meet after the inclusion of 20 patients (and then again after accrual of 50 patients) in the cabazitaxel and pelvic radiotherapy arm, to assess tolerance, (i.e. after the inclusion of approximately 80 and then 200 patients in the trial). Depending on the results of this feasibility phase and of any new relevant clinical results in such a population, the remaining patients (n=848) will be enrolled.\n\nDuring this second phase, the IDMC will then meet every two years approximately during accrual to carefully assess accrual rate and toxicity and examine the efficacy interim analysis results in the light of the results of similar trials.",

    "detailed_description": "This study aims to determine the optimal treatment regimen for older and/or otherwise toxicity-vulnerable patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who cannot receive approved standard therapy. As a result, this Phase II trial of isatuximab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (Isa-Rd) selectively enroll much older and/or otherwise highly toxicity-vulnerable participants. Furthermore, the safety and effectiveness of isatuximab when used in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone at lower doses will be evaluated. It is expected that using this combination at lower doses, may help patients achieve a better response while causing fewer or less severe side effects.\n\nAll participants on the trial will also be evaluated by Cancer and Aging Research Group Geriatric Assessments (CARG-GA) and patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures of quality of life (QOL). \"Geriatric assessment\" will be referred to as \"global assessment\" for study purposes, to reflect the fact that younger participants will likely participate in the study. Optional correlative blood samples will be collected to study biomarkers of aging and frailty with a focus on both the relation to isatuximab specifically, as well as treatment response and risk for intolerability.\n\nDuration of Therapy:\n\nThe length of study participation will depend on the response to the treatment, and it may last approximately 2 years. Participants will receive isatuximab for two years, and then isatuximab will be discontinued. Dexamethasone administration will occur weekly for the first eight cycles. Lenalidomide will be continued as maintenance until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nIn the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment should continue until:\n\n* Disease progression\n* Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment\n* Treatment delay of more than 12 weeks.\n* Unacceptable adverse event(s)\n* Pregnancy\n* Subject decides to withdraw from study treatment, or\n* General or specific changes in the subject's condition render the subject unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.\n* Subject is lost to follow up\n\nDuration of Follow Up:\n\nAll participants (including those withdrawn for AE (Adverse Event) will be followed after removal from study treatment until death or full subject withdrawal from the study for other reasons. Participants removed from study treatment for unacceptable AEs will be followed for resolution or stabilization of the adverse event(s).",

Patients randomized in arm A will receive 3 cycles of the monoclonal antibody isatuximab intravenously, combined with RVd regimen (Lenalidomide, Bortezomib, Dexamethasone). Each cycle will last for 42 days. Patients in arm B will receive 3 cycles RVd plus isatuximab subcutaneously.

End of study will be after the first HDM/ASCT.\n\nThere is one primary objective:\n\nDemonstration of non-inferiority of subcutaneous (SC) isatuximab compared to intravenous (IV) isatuximab, both in combination with RVd, with respect to rates of VGPR or better after induction therapy (according to standard International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria).\n\nKey secondary objectives are:\n\n1. Comparison of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) regarding route of administration of isatuximab (SC vs. IV) on induction therapy as assessed by modified CTSQ (modified 9-item questionnaire).\n2. Non-inferiority of rates of MRD negativity (assessed by NGS from BMA; sensitivity 10\\^-5) independent of standard IMWG response after induction therapy.\n\nThe duration of the trial for each patients is expected to be approximately 10 months (induction and intensification treatment).",

The first consultation for the participant will be with the doctor and depending on the participant's need, the following consultations can be scheduled with either a doctor- or a nurse consultation. After each consultation, it will be decided in collaboration between the healthcare professionals and the participant whether a nurse or a doctor consultation will be relevant next. The consultations (whether it is with the doctor or nurse) will be centered around the participant's choice of topics by use of an atopic dermatitis dialogue tool developed in the department. Additionally, the nurse consultation will focus on therapeutic patient education (TPE) in atopic dermatitis. The interval between consultations will depend on the patient's need",

The study will specifically investigate the impact of administering lower-than-standard doses of pomalidomide and dexamethasone. Using lower doses of pomalidomide and dexamethasone in this setting has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",
    "detailed_description": "This study aims to address the challenges faced in selecting appropriate therapy for elderly or highly toxicity-vulnerable patients who are poor candidates for standard (full-dose) chemotherapy regimens. Traditional clinical trials often exclude these patients, limiting the generalizability of available data. This single-arm multicenter phase II study will enroll 49 older and/or toxicity-vulnerable patients with RRMM. The study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of isatuximab when used in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone at lower than standard doses. The primary objective is to estimate the overall response rate (ORR), while secondary objectives include the estimation of additional measures of response, as well as measures of toxicity and tolerability. All participants in the trial will also be evaluated by Cancer and Aging Research Group Geriatric Assessments (CARG-GA) and patient- reported outcome (PRO) measures of quality of life (QOL). Biomarkers of aging and frailty will also be studied.\n\nDuration of therapy:\n\nThe duration of study participation will depend on the response to the treatment. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment with Isa-Pd will generally continue until disease progression, unacceptable side effects, other illness or condition that prevents further study treatment, or a subject's decision to withdraw from the study. On average, subjects will most likely be treated for approximately 10 months on this study.\n\nDuration of Follow-Up:\n\nAll participants, including those withdrawn for adverse events (AEs) will be followed after removal from study treatment until death or full subject withdrawal from the study for other reasons. Participants removed from the study treatment for unacceptable AEs will be followed for resolution or stabilization of the AEs.",

In addition, numerous studies have demonstrated the profound impact of graft composition on transplant outcomes, but not a single prospective study has addressed this issue successfully. In this study, the investigators intend to test a novel double pronged method of changing the immune repertoire post ASCT by modifying graft composition and improving effector T cell recovery and function post ASCT. In this study, the investigators intend to generate new information on immune modulation post-ASCT. In addition, the CD38 antibodies have not been evaluated as therapy for B-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). If this study shows significant immunomodulator activity of this approach, cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) antibodies could be further evaluated in combination with ASCT in NHL.",

    "detailed_description": "The treatment goals in elderly patients with multiple myeloma (MM) are similar to those in younger patients: rapid and long-lasting symptom control, deep response and durable remissions as well as increased survival are at the forefront, similar to therapy goals in younger patients. Elderly patients frequently present with comorbidities, reduced treatment tolerance and greater frequency of treatment discontinuations. Hence, treatment needs to be adapted to the specific needs of this patient population.\n\nln the recent decade lenalidomide-based therapies have been established as effective treatment modalities in elderly patients. In elderly patients lenalidomide + dexamethasone (Rd) is one of the most frequently used treatment regimens, which is effective and well tolerated.\n\nMM is a high unmet medical need and as a result, several agents are currently under clinical investigation in MM. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are one of the most promising groups of drugs in development in the treatment of MM with several of them demonstrating activity in this disease. lsatuximab is a highly effective monoclonal antibody with an excellent activity and tolerance profile, active as single agent therapy in patients with multiple prior lines of treatment.\n\nPresently several trials with isatuximab-lenalidomide containing treatment regimens are ongoing. The expected benefits of adding isatuximab to Rd over Rd alone in very elderly patients seem to outweigh possible risks by far.\n\nA greater depth of response is anticipated including greater number of MRD (minimal residual disease) negative patients, higher response rates, and longer progression free survival.\n\nRisk conferred with the addition of isatuximab are mainly restricted to a roughly 40% rate of infusion reactions, which usually are seen at the first infusion only. ln addition, there is an increased risk for grade 4 leukopenia, grade 2 and 3 thrombocytopenia, and grade 3 infection and fatigue.",

Treatment of AL amyloidosis relies mainly on chemotherapy aimed at suppressing the underlying plasma cell clone secreting monoclonal FLC.\n\nThe organ responses and the survival are greatly influenced by the degree of hematological response evaluated by the decrease in serum FLC that has been the principal endpoint in recent trials in AL amyloidosis. The goal of treatment is to reach at least a very good partial response (VGPR) defined as a difference between the involved FLC and the normal one below 40 mg/L.\n\nOver the last 5 years, monoclonal antibodies (mAb) as daratumumab and Isatuximab (anti CD38 mAb) has emerged as a breakthrough targeted therapies for patients with multiple myeloma (MM).\n\nCD38, is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that functions both as a signal-transducing receptor and a multifunctional ectoenzyme. The expression of CD38 is increased in MM and AL amyloidosis plasma cells.\n\nDaratumumab (DARA) is an IgG 1k human mAb that received initial approval as monotherapy in patients with heavily pretreated RRMM and who were refractory to proteasome inhibitors (PIs) and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD\u00ae). DARA has since been approved in combination with Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone1,2 and Bortezomib/Dexamethasone3,4 for the treatment of frontline and relapsed/refractory (RR) MM patients.\n\nIFM and other groups previously demonstrated that DARA in monotherapy is safe and effective in relapsed AL amyloidosis patients5. Our prospective phase II study showed that about 70 to 80% of patients have a response but only around 50% reached a VGPR.\n\nDARA activity could be increased with IMiD\u00ae as treating plasma cells with IMiD\u00ae, such as pomalidomide or lenalidomide, has been shown to increase the expression of CD38 levels on the surface of these cells.\n\nIn AL amyloidosis, the Italian and the British groups demonstrated that pomalidomide is very effective and better tolerated than lenalidomide especially in patients with renal insufficiency6,7. The dose of pomalidomide (4 mg) was like the dose used in MM.\n\nCombining an anti CD38 mAb to pomalidomide could therefore be an attractive regimen for relapsed AL amyloidosis patients.\n\nIsatuximab (ISA) is another IgG1 \u03ba mAb that binds selectively to a unique epitope on the human CD38 receptor and has anti plasma cells activity via multiple mechanisms of action. In a previous phase 1b study, around 65% of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma achieved an overall response with a combination of Isatuximab with Pomalidomide and low-dose Dexamethasone.\n\nThe addition of Isatuximab to Pomalidomide-Dexamethasone was used in a large phase III study in RRMM8. Safety profile was also favorable, and these results granted an approval of the combination of ISA plus Pomalidomide (4 mg) and Dexamethasone in these patients.",

    "detailed_description": "INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE\n\nObesity (body mass index (BMI) \u226530 kg/m2) prevalence in Dutch adults increased to 14.2% in 2020. In Rotterdam this percentage is even higher. Obesity is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease, especially heart failure (HF). Unpublished data of our research group show that 20% of subjects with obesity without known cardiac disease who are evaluated for bariatric screening, fulfil the diagnostic criteria for HF. HF is a serious condition with significant morbidity and mortality. Dutch health care expenditures for HF are high (currently over half a billion Euros per year), and most of this expenditure is made in hospital care, underscoring the importance of prevention. Apart from the obesity itself, prevalence of other HF risk factors such as diabetes (20%) and hypertension (30%) is high in obese adults.\n\nThere is no active screening for HF or its risk factors in adults with obesity in the Netherlands. HF in people with obesity often remains undetected for a relatively long time, because symptoms are attributed to the obesity and not to possible HF. As a result, individuals seek help late for already advanced HF. Screening may reveal HF risk factors or a HF diagnosis. Early treatment initiation will improve prognosis, both in terms of quality of life and morbidity and mortality.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nMain research question: does active screening in primary care for HF or its risk factors in adults with obesity improve outcome, defined as a lower prevalence of a combined endpoint of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and/or HF admission?\n\nHypothesis:\n\nPrimary care screening for early signs of HF in patients with obesity without known heart disease is effective, both in terms of clinical outcome measures and cost-effectiveness. Screening leads to a lower prevalence of LV dysfunction and HF after one year of follow-up due to initiation of treatment of HF and risk factors for HF identified at the time of screening.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo investigate whether active screening for early signs of HF and its risk factors in adults with obesity without known heart disease improves clinical outcome.\n\nSub-questions:\n\n1. What is the prevalence of undiscovered HF in adults with obesity participating in a combined lifestyle intervention (CLI) program, as identified at baseline by active screening?\n2. What is the prevalence of undiscovered risk factors for HF (e.g. hypertension, diabetes) in adults with obesity participating in a CLI program, as identified at baseline by active screening?\n3. What are, apart from the obesity itself, risk factors for having HF at baseline in adults with obesity participating in a CLI program?\n4. Does active screening for early signs of HF and its risk factors in adults with obesity without known heart disease participating in a CLI program lead to a better of quality of life as compared to standard care at 1 year follow-up?\n5. Does active screening for early signs of HF and its risk factors in adults with obesity without known heart disease participating in a CLI program lead to improvement of dyspnea (NYHA classification) at 1 year follow-up in screened patients with HF at the time of screening?\n6. Is the effect of the studied screening program driven by treatment of risk factors for HF in screened adults without HF at the time of screening, or by treatment of HF in adults with diagnosed HF at the time of screening?\n7. Is the studied screening program in adults with obesity cost-effective as compared to usual care of adults with obesity participating in a CLI program in The Netherlands?\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\n\nSCOR(hf)E is an investigator driven, not blinded, randomized controlled superiority trial.\n\nDuring two years, prospective inclusion of 468 subjects with obesity, aged 45 years and older, without a history of cardiac disease, will take place at 3 organizations of a CLI intervention. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to either an active screening for HF or a continuation of standard care (a watchful waiting policy; these people will not undergo any investigations at baseline).\n\nSubjects randomized to screening for HF will be evaluated using anamnesis, physical examination, an ECG, blood tests and an echocardiogram. Screening may reveal additional HF risk factors such as hypertension or diabetes that will be treated and followed according to guidelines. Patients will be given appropriate lifestyle advice. Patients with a HF diagnosis will be referred to a cardiologist and treated according to the guidelines.\n\nThe hypothesis of the study is that one year of treatment of the subset of screened patients with HF or HF risk factors identified at the time of screening, will lead to a lower prevalence of LV dysfunction and acute HF admissions (the main study endpoint) in the intervention group (the patients that underwent the HF screening) versus the control group. After one year, echocardiography will be performed in all subjects, both in the intervention and standard care group. Asymptomatic LV dysfunction (assessed with echocardiography) was chosen as a component of the primary endpoint as it reflects a heightened risk status, specifically to the later development of HF. Presence of HF will be defined as HF symptoms that have required an emergency hospital admission.\n\nSAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION\n\nSample size calculation Follow-up time and sample size calculation are partly based on findings from the STOP-HF trial. This trial met its primary endpoint, showing a reduction of LV dysfunction and/or HF admissions from 8.7% to 5.3% by a screening program using B-type natriuretic peptide.\n\nEstimated effect size:\n\nThe investigators will use global longitudinal strain (GLS), an echocardiographic parameter clearly more sensitive for LV dysfunction than the parameters used in the aforementioned STOP-HF trial. In our CARdiac Dysfunction In Obesity - Early Signs Evaluation (CARDIOBESE) study, 26% of patients with obesity without known HF \u00e1nd not fulfilling the criteria of LV dysfunction of STOP-HF, had significantly decreased GLS (currently used as a criterion for HF diagnosis). A conservative estimate would be that a year after screening, this proportion will be reduced to 19% due to the effect of treatment of patients with HF or risk factors for HF. Also, since the investigators can use improved treatment options developed during the last decade, the effect of the screening is expected to be larger than in STOP-HF.\n\nIn STOP-HF, acute HF admission occurred in 2.1% of the participants in the control group versus 1.0% of the intervention group.\n\nSample size calculation (two tailed, using \u03b1=0.05 and a power level of 80%) based on the aforementioned estimated effect size:\n\nproportion of the primary endpoint in the control group 36.8% (26% (decreased GLS) + 8.7% (fulfilling the criteria of LV dysfunction of STOP-HF) + 2.1% (acute HF admissions)), proportion of the primary endpoint in the intervention group 24.0% (19% (decreased GLS) +4.0% (fulfilling the criteria of LV dysfunction of STOP-HF; effect of the screening is expected to be larger than in STOP-HF since the investigators can use improved treatment options) + 1.0% (acute HF admissions): sample size of 199 per group.\n\nWithdrawal of study participation is expected to be maximal 5%. Therefore, the investigators will include 420 subjects.\n\nRANDOMISATION, BLINDING AND TREATMENT ALLOCATION\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to a screening for HF or usual care (1:1). For allocation, a computer-generated block randomization sequence will be used, stratified by participating CLI practice. An independent physician from Franciscus Gasthuis \\& Vlietland will extract the randomization schedule from an electronic randomization tool and send the codes in sealed, sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes to the participating practices.\n\nSTUDY PROCEDURES\n\nParticipants randomized to standard care will not undergo any tests related to the study at baseline.\n\nParticipants randomized to a screening for HF will receive an appointment at either the Franciscus Gasthuis \\& Vlietland hospital or Star-shl diagnostic center, according to preference of the participant. Here, anamnesis and physical examination will be performed, blood samples will be taken and an ECG and echocardiogram will be acquired.\n\nDiagnosis of HF will be based on the current guidelines. When HF is diagnosed, the patient will be referred to a cardiologist of the Franciscus Gasthuis \\& Vlietland. When there are incidental findings, such as increased blood glucose or hypertension, patients will be referred to their general practitioner for follow-up and treatment when necessary.\n\nAfter 1 year follow-up, both participants randomized to standard care and to screening for HF will be approached to assess the combined primary endpoint of LV dysfunction and/or an acute HF admission. Participants will be asked whether they have had an unplanned hospital admission for HF. If this is the case, information will be requested from the hospital in question. A joint panel consisting of three cardiologists will evaluate the findings and results of all diagnostic tests that took place during the admission. Adjudication of diagnoses by a panel of physicians is an accepted reference standard for the evaluation of HF, for which a true reference standard is lacking. In case the panel does not reach consensus, a majority decision will count. Also, in all participants an echocardiogram will be acquired, again in either the Franciscus Gasthuis \\& Vlietland hospital or Star-shl diagnostic center. Finally, participants will be asked to fill-out the Health Related - Quality of Life (HR-QoL) with the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire.\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\n\nAll analyses will be carried out on an intention-to-treat basis. The distributions of variables will be tested for normality by the Shapiro-Wilk test. The significance threshold will be defined as P \\<0.05 and all tests are 2-sided.\n\nMissing data will be handled using multiple imputation with chained equations with 10 imputations and 10 iterations per imputation. Predictive mean matching will be used for all variables.\n\nPrimary study parameter The difference in prevalence of LV dysfunction and HF between the intervention group and the control group will be analysed using logistic regression modelling.\n\nSecondary study parameters\n\n* (subquestion 1 and 2) The prevalence of HF and/or undiscovered risk factors for HF as identified by active screening will be described as a percentage of the total screened population (the intervention group).\n* (subquestion 3) HF prevalence will be presented stratified by sex, age (tertiles), BMI (tertiles), waist circumference (tertiles), diabetes, hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea. Also, the investigators will provide descriptive statistics (parameters mentioned in the previous sentence) of the subjects in the intervention group with HF versus without HF at baseline. Differences between the groups in age, BMI and waist circumference will be tested using independent t-tests in case of normal distribution or Mann-Whitney-U tests in case of non-normality. Differences in % male, diabetes, hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea will be tested with Chi-square tests.\n* (subquestion 4) Findings of the HR-QoL questionnaire will be compared between the intervention and standard care groups, using independent t-test or Mann-Whitney-U test for the total scores, and Chi square tests for the subscales.\n* (subquestion 5) The Chi Square test will be used in screened patients with HF at the time of screening, to compare NYHA classification at baseline and follow-up.",

The failure rate is even more pronounced in those patients that present with high prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, pT3 disease, positive margins and Gleason score \u22658 with an estimated 75% failure rate at 10 years.\n\nPost-operative radiotherapy (RT) has been shown in three randomized trials to significantly decrease the biochemical failure rate and in one of the trials a survival benefit was also seen with the addition of post-operative RT and is considered by many investigators standard therapy in patients with pathological high-risks factors even in absence of biochemical failure.",
    "detailed_description": "Although RT is known to potentially eradicate microscopic disease localized in the prostatic bed, the current dilemma is whether to deliver RT in the adjuvant setting (defined as the use of RT post-prostatectomy to patients at a higher risk of recurrence because of adverse pathological features prior to evidence of disease recurrence (i.e., with an undetectable PSA) or to use it as an early salvage therapy (defined as the use of RT in patients with rising PSA but no evidence of metastatic disease).\n\nThere are several institutional retrospective reports on the use of RT as salvage therapy but no randomized trial has ever been completed. The best evidence available, however, supports early salvage RT as the best strategy to be used to maximize results.\n\nOur own group has shown excellent results using this approach in patients with low and intermediate risk disease and is currently exploring this approach in patients with high-risk disease. Hypofractionated RT offers a more convenient shorter course of treatment, reduces health-costs and appears to be as effective and safe as conventionally fractionated regimens.\n\nThis Phase 2 trial will study the potential role of hypofractionated in the post-operative setting in patients with high-risk features with the primary objective of assessing toxicity from this approach.\n\nThe use of androgen deprivation therapy in combination with RT in the primary treatment for patients with intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer is well established. The use of androgen suppression in the post-operative setting has been less explored and its definitive role has not been fully explored.\n\nThis is a phase II clinical trial to assess the feasibility and overall toxicity of adding one injection of neo-adjuvant hormonal therapy starting 12 weeks before plus Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for four weeks concurrently with another injection of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analog in patients with post-operative setting in patients with high-risk features.",

Once the phase 2 questionnaire has been completed, Only participants with fragility fractures will be randomized to one of the three following educational intervention groups: 1) the Educational Video Group, 2) the Documentation Group, or 3) the Control Group.\n\nAt phase 3, 12 to 14 months after randomization, the effectiveness of the interventions will be assessed by re-administering the questionnaires to participants who experienced a fragility fracture at baseline. The questionnaires evaluate the status of diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis, modifiable risk factors and the health-related quality of life (EQ-5D). The impact of the interventions on the participants will be assessed by comparing diagnosis and treatments rates in each intervention arm.\n\nIf the long-term viability of the programme is secured, participants with fragility and traumatic fractures will be followed for a maximum period of 20 years using specific encoded personal data contained in the RAMQ and Quebec's drug plan databases.",

    "brief_summary": "Overall the issue of patients above 65-70 years of age being that it is impossible for most of them to undergo an intensive treatment like autologous stem cell transplant with little prospect of debulking effectively the bone marrow with chemotherapy, and also few possibilities to harass the bone microenvironment in the tumoral niche.\n\nIf, advanced age in frail patients is predictive of an increased risk of treatment-related toxicity, there is a growing number of elderly patients in regards to transplantation, but still fit if one considers the objectives of life characterized with prolonged survival. These patients might have the same treatment as to the transplant eligible, but without the transplant procedure. The development of immunotherapy has transformed the treatment landscape of cancer, particularly in MM, increasing the treatment possibilities with possibly fewer adverse events.\n\nThe therapeutic strategy and treatment options for NTE patients moved from melphalan-based induction regimens to lenalidomide-based associations, which is now the backbone of most treatment for NTE patients. Even though the latest melphalan, bortezomib and prednisone (MPV) association was considered somewhat effective it was not so well tolerated. Furthermore, MPV hardly prolonged PFS beyond 2 years. It was recently improved with the addition of Daratumumab, first in class anti CD38 Mab in the phase III ALCYONE.\n\nThe association lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) has significantly improved the easiness of treating the NTE population and all drugs seem to be possible to combine to Rd. In that extent, proteasome inhibitors have always been one of the most impactful family of agents in MM, and as expected Bortezomib plus Rd has become a very relevant and commonly used regimen in NTE NDMM. These groundbreaking results have favored the development of 2 randomized phase 3 studies for registration of combination of antiCD38Mab (Daratumumab (Cepheus, NCT03652064), Isatuximab (Imroz, NCT03319667) +Rd +Velcade in comparison to VRd. Both studies have used as a comparator the VRd regimen which is today one of the safest, active and popular triplet based Rd regimen, approved, and therefore the best control arm possibly for these studies.\n\nHowever, as much as there has been no direct head to head comparison of VRd to Dara Rd, when looking at the data from Maia it is anticipated that DRd will become a standard of care, and might challenge strongly VRd. Yet, multiple questions remain still, anticipating the change in backbone from VRd to antiCD38 +Rd becoming the new standard of care for NTE NDMM patients. The investigators have therefore planned to answer the critical question of the role of proteasome inhibitors in NTE non frail NDMM when considering anti CD38 +Rd as the backbone.",
