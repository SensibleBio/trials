    "detailed_description": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with more than 900,000 newly diagnosed cases and approximately 830,000 deaths in 2020. Surgical resection and liver transplantation are potential curative options for patients with early-stage HCC. However, most patients present with metastatic and/or unresectable disease and systemic treatment is the only therapeutic option for these patients.\n\nAlthough several ICI-based combination therapies have recently extended survival for many patients with HCC, biomarker-directed strategies are limited for this disease. Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) is a protein that is expressed in prostate cells and overexpressed in prostate cancer and is accepted as a valuable theragnostic (combined diagnostic and therapeutic) target in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET (PSMA PET) is now utilized to select patients with metastatic prostate cancer for PSMA-directed therapy with 177Lu-PSMA-617. PSMA is now known to be expressed in a variety of solid tumors, including HCC, specifically in the neovasculature associated with solid tumors. However, there is a lack of data exploring whether there is a role for PSMA-directed therapy in non-prostate solid tumors.\n\nInvestigator performed PSMA IHC on 148 HCCs from surgical resection or liver explant specimens from patients at the Mayo Clinic, and 90% of HCCs showed PSMA immunostaining localized to the tumor endothelium. More than 50% of HCCs showed 31-100% PSMA immunostaining by area. In several cases, the normal liver background did show faint canalicular staining, highlighting the need to distinguish between normal tissue and tumor-associated expression.\n\nIn a similar study using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to evaluate PSMA expression in HCC, 79.2% of tumors showed high levels of PSMA expression at any location, with the majority of this expression occurring in a neovascular staining pattern (89.9%). One patient underwent imaging with PSMA PET which demonstrated intense and heterogeneous PSMA uptake in the HCC tumor.\n\nSeveral additional reports have demonstrated that PSMA expression in HCC can be detected noninvasively by PSMA PET.20,21 Our group at Mayo Clinic prospectively evaluated PSMA uptake using Ga-PSMA PET in patients with treatment-na\u00efve HCC. In 31 patients, 39 lesions were identified. In this study, 64% had high PSMA uptake (grade 3 or 4) and 36% had low PSMA uptake (grade 1 or 2). It is expected that PSMA uptake will be much higher in patients with advanced HCC. PSMA PET has been compared with MRI for detection of HCC and had similar efficacy to MRI in a cohort of 19 patients. Similarly, a meta-analysis of 6 studies including 126 patients imaged with PET/CT or PET/MRI with PSMA-targeting radiopharmaceuticals in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent HCC showed a detection rate of greater than 85%.These studies clearly suggest that targeting PSMA could be an attractive target in patients with advanced HCC.\n\nThe VISION study was a phase 3 trial investigating the efficacy and safety of 177Lu-PSMA-617 (Lu-177 vipivotide tetraxetan) with standard of care in patients with previously treated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who were identified as PSMA PET-positive. Similarly, the phase III PSMAfore study of Lu-177 vipivotide tetraxetan demonstrated improvement in radiographic progression-free survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after prior treatment.\n\nIn HCC, a recent preclinical study demonstrated that radioligand therapy using \\[177Lu\\]Lu-PSMA-617 and \\[177Lu\\]Lu-EB-PSMA-617 effectively suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival time in PSMA-positive HCC xenograft mice. However, this strategy has not been prospectively utilized in patients with HCC after first-line therapy. There is limited clinical data examining the role of PSMA radioligand therapy in HCC. One study included 2 patients with no other systemic therapy options available and demonstrated insufficient tumor radiation dosing by intratherapeutic SPECT/CT-based dosimetry after only a single cycle of therapy. This data is limited by the short treatment course of only 1 cycle, which was inadequate to induce a response, small sample size, and heavy pre-treatment.\n\nAlthough the pattern of PSMA expression in HCC is distinct from that in prostate cancer, there is evidence from tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) efficacy that targeting the neovasculature via inhibition of angiogenesis in the local tumor environment can limit tumor growth and improve survival.",

Subjects will review and eventually sign the consent form. They will be administered a physical examination, clinical assessment and standardized questionnaires for cognitive testing and/or other co-morbidities. In addition, blood samples will be drawn for genotype testing, infection screening, complete blood count and liver function test.\n\nDemographics, physical examinations and neurologic assessments will be conducted at Partners MS Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 60 Fenwood Road, Boston, MA 02115.\n\nGenotype Testing:\n\nBlood sample drawn on the initial screening visit will be used to obtain genomic DNA for genotyping for polymorphism within the TSPO gene on chromosome 22q13.2, using a Taqman assay. High affinity and medium affinity binders will be included in the study, whereas low affinity binders will be excluded from the study.\n\nPET Scanning:\n\nFor this study, all subjects will undergo five separate visits for \\[F-18\\]PBR06 PET scans, one visit before starting Ofatumumab treatment (day 0 baseline) and four more visits at approximately 5, 28, 90 and 273 days after initiating treatment.

    "brief_summary": "Collaboration with multiple sclerosis (MS) specialty colleagues led us to formulate the central hypothesis that Siponimod could lower the rate of brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects. To test our central hypothesis, we will carry out an 18-month Phase II, double-blind, randomized, twoarmed, placebo controlled, proof-of-concept clinical study in early AD subjects (i.e. mild AD) who will be receiving an escalating dose of Siponimod or placebo in the ratio 2:1 for 12 months, followed by a 6-month washout period. The primary outcome measures are safety and tolerability of Siponimod in mild AD subjects. The secondary outcome measures are the rates of brain atrophy derived from volumetric MRI (vMRI) as a proxy for neurodegeneration conducted at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. The tertiary outcome measures are the changes in cognition and the levels of AD-associated (e.g., A\u03b2 and tau) and inflammatory biomarkers in CSF after Siponimod exposure. In an exploratory effort, we will also measure plasma inflammatory markers during the entire duration of the study to investigate whether one or more of these markers can be used as dynamic surrogate markers of treatment response. Using our unique experience with the repurposing of immunomodulatory drugs for AD (and NCT #04032626), in the present project we are using elements of clinical trial design that we believe were successful and made some adjustments to fit the pharmacologic and toxic properties of Siponimod.",
    "detailed_description": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with several complex neuropathologies suspected to develop sequentially but that overlap over time as symptoms progress to dementia. Thus, to be effective, future intervention strategies will likely require combination therapies or pleiotropic agents to tackle several AD molecular pathogenic pathways simultaneously. For more than a decade, our group has been exploring the repurposing of immunomodulators for AD. Recent discussions with collaborators who specialize in multiple sclerosis suggest that sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulators are strong candidates for repurposing in AD. Indeed, S1PR modulators are blood brain barrier (BBB) penetrant and display pleiotropic actions, including immunomodulation and neuroprotective properties. S1P is a versatile endogenous molecule that regulates several signaling pathways by binding to five G-protein-coupled receptors, which are expressed in high levels in cardiac, vascular, immune, and brain cells. This widespread localization of S1PR was the historical basis for Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Inc, to develop oral formulations of S1PR modulators for multiple sclerosis (MS), which proved successful and resulted in two marketed oral compounds (i.e., fingolimod and Siponimod). In the present project, we intend to collaborate with Novartis to use the most recently FDA-approved S1PR modulator, Siponimod. Based on MS and animal experimentation literature, we hypothesize that Siponimod could alter the rate of neurodegeneration as measured by lowering the rate of brain atrophy in mild AD dementia subjects. In this Phase II, proof-of-concept, translational clinical study, mild AD dementia subjects will be randomized 2:1 and will receive gradual titration regimen of Siponimod starting at 0.25mg/day and increasing up to final dosage of 1 mg/day (N=70) or placebo (N=35) for 12 months. This will be followed by a 6-month washout period. Siponimod has demonstrated positive immunomodulatory and neuroprotective actions in MS patients, and because its toxicity profile is favorable for use in older individuals, Siponimod has a strong potential to alter markers of mild AD dementia pathology and disease trajectory.",

    "detailed_description": "Background. Papillary craniopharyngioma harbours a BRAF mutation in 90% of cases. Treatment with BRAF + MEK (mitogen activated protein kinase ) inhibitors (dabrafenib + trametinib) may prevent patients from undergoing surgery with a high risk of serious side effects, or provide an additional treatment option when further surgery is not advised.\n\nStudy intervention Subjects with newly diagnosed craniopharyngioma where radical surgery is not considered adequate or patients with recurrence of craniopharyngioma where further surgery is not considered possible without serious sequelae will be asked for informed consent Study participants are treated continuously with dabrafenib and trametinib orally, until maximal tumor shrinkage. Evaluation is done by MRI to measure tumor volume, as well as assessment of performance status, quality of life, cognition, ophthalmologic status, performance status and hypothalamic status.\n\nStudy type The study is a Phase II, single armed, open label and multicenter study Study drugs are Dabrafenib (Tafinlar) and trametinib (Mekinist) Primary outcome To evaluate tumor response in the form of reduced tumor volume on MRI in patients with papillary craniopharyngioma during treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib.\n\nSecondary outcomes\n\nTo evaluate dabrafenib and trametinib treatment for the following aspects:\n\n* response according to RECIST Duration of response for patients treated without subsequent surgery\n* how many patients become operable after neoadjuvant treatment\n* progression-free survival after 1 and 2 years\n* quality of life during and after treatment The effect of treatment on vision, cognition and hypothalamic effects Exploratory outcomes Levels of circulating BRAF Trial population 25 patients Trial duration Participants are treated with the study treatment for at least one year if the treatment is well tolerated, to maximum tumor reduction, or longer according to the investigators\u00b4s assessment.

    "detailed_description": "Most patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative, nodal-positive breast cancer are treated with curative intent, which typically involves some combination of surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy. While chemotherapy has benefits in patients with high genomic risk (RS\\>31), its benefits in patients whose tumors have RS\\<26 is non-existent in some patients and controversial in others. There is ongoing debate about whether chemotherapy benefit arises primarily from endocrine effect (chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea) or its direct cytotoxic effects. The controversy is now more complex because of the benefits and widespread use of CDK 4/6 inhibitors. There is also uncertainty regarding the extent to which administering adjuvant chemotherapy affects the discontinuation rates of CDK 4/6 inhibitors in clinical practice. This is a Phase II, two-arm, single center, patient preference study designed to evaluate the impact of adjuvant chemotherapy in moderate to high-anatomical risk (men or premenopausal women T1-3N1-2, and postmenopausal women T3N1 or T1-3N2), low-genomic risk (RS \u2264 25), ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer participants treated with a combination regimen of ribociclib and optimized endocrine therapy. Participants will have the option to decide whether to include adjuvant chemotherapy in their treatment plan. Arm 1 will receive the combination of ribociclib and optimized endocrine therapy. Arm 2 will be treated with adjuvant chemotherapy followed by a combination of ribociclib and optimized endocrine therapy. GnRH agonists are used to achieve gonadal suppression in all men or premenopausal women. The primary objective is to assess the one-year discontinuation rate of ribociclib in arm 1 and arm 2, respectively. The study plans to enroll 70 participants to each arm to ensure the investigators can estimate one-year discontinuation rate with a reasonable level of precision. It is hypothesized that patients who choose to omit adjuvant chemotherapy would be less likely to discontinue ribociclib therapy within the first year, potentially resulting in lower treatment-related toxicity, improved quality of life, and possibly better long-term outcomes.",

This may prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells.\n\nPazopanib is designed to block a protein that may cause uncontrolled tumor growth. Blocking this protein may prevent cancer from growing and spreading.\n\nStudy Drug Administration:\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of dice) to 1 of 6 groups. There is an equal chance of being assigned to each group.\n\n* Group 1 will receive pazopanib, possibly followed by bevacizumab.\n* Group 2 will receive pazopanib, possibly followed by everolimus.\n* Group 3 will receive everolimus, possibly followed by bevacizumab.\n* Group 4 will receive everolimus, possibly followed by pazopanib.\n* Group 5 will receive bevacizumab, possibly followed by pazopanib.\n* Group 6 will receive bevacizumab, possibly followed by everolimus.\n\nIf the disease gets worse while you receive your first assigned drug, you will stop taking the drug. Then if you are not having side effects, you will start taking your second assigned drug 2-4 weeks later.\n\nEverolimus is taken by mouth 1 time per day (at about the same time each day).\n\nBevacizumab is given by vein over 30-90 minutes, 1 time every 2 weeks.\n\nPazopanib is taken by mouth 1 time per day (at about the same time each day on an empty stomach).\n\nYou may be able to receive the bevacizumab doses at your local doctor's office. Ask your study doctor about this.\n\nStudy Visits:\n\nEvery week during Weeks 1-4, your blood pressure will be checked (either at home, at the clinic, or by your local doctor) if you are taking pazopanib or bevacizumab. If you are checking your own blood pressure at home, you should keep a log to write down your blood pressure. Bring the log to your next clinic visit.\n\nEvery 2 weeks, urine will be collected for routine tests if you are receiving bevacizumab.\n\nEvery 4 weeks:\n\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.\n* Your performance status will be recorded.\n* You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.\n* You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.\n* Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If you are receiving everolimus, you will fast (have nothing to eat or drink except water) starting the night before these tests. The doctor will discuss this with you.\n* Urine will be collected for routine tests if you are receiving everolimus or pazopanib.\n\nEvery 8 weeks, the following tests and procedures will be performed. If you are receiving the study treatment at your local doctor's office, you must return to MD Anderson for these tests and procedures.\n\n* Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If you are receiving pazopanib, this blood will also be used to check your thyroid function.\n* You will have CT scans of the chest and abdomen to check the status of the disease.\n* You will fill out 5 questionnaires about the quality of your life and about how you are feeling. This should take about 30 minutes.\n\nEvery year, you will have an MRI of the brain to check the status of the disease.\n\nEvery year, you will have an ECHO or MUGA scan to check the health of your heart.\n\nAnytime the doctor decides it is needed, you will have scans such as a CT scan of the pelvis, an MRI scan of the abdomen or brain, ECHO or MUGA scan, and/or a bone scan.\n\nAfter 1 year, if the disease has not gotten worse, you may have less clinic visits and tests.\n\nLength of Participation:\n\nYou may continue taking a study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take a study drug if intolerable side effects occur, or if the disease gets worse after you take your second assigned study drug.\n\nEnd-of-Treatment Visit:\n\nWhen you are finished taking the study drug(s):\n\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.\n* You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.\n* You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.\n\nLong-Term Follow-Up:\n\nAfter your End-of-Treatment visit, the study staff will contact you by phone, e-mail, or you will come in for a clinic visit. You will be asked about how you are feeling and any side effects you may have had. Each follow-up will take about 5 minutes. Follow-up will take place every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the third year, and 1 time a year after that. The last follow-up will be about 5 years after the last patient is enrolled.\n\nThis is an investigational study. Everolimus, bevacizumab, and pazopanib are all FDA approved and commercially available for kidney cancer. The investigational part of this study is to find out which order these drugs should be given in.\n\nUp to 240 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.",

Ribociclib and tucatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches itself to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab attaches to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the tumor cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune system. Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast tumor cells. Fulvestrant blocks the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Chemotherapy drugs, such as docetaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ribociclib, tucatinib, and trastuzumab with or without fulvestrant before surgery may make the tumor smaller and may reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.",

It also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the drugs for your type of cancer.\n\nThe FDA has not approved Trametinib or Dabrafenib for your specific disease but they have been approved for other uses.\n\nSome cancers have changes (mutations) in a gene called BRAF or other genes, called KRAS or NRAS. These three genes tell the body to make a protein called BRAF, KRAS, or NRAS, respectively, which are all involved in sending signals in cells that can lead to cell growth. Certain mutations in these three genes cause a change in these proteins that can increase the growth and spread of cancer cells.\n\nDabrafenib and trametinib work to prevent these altered proteins from working and sending signals in cancer cells, and thereby may block the growth and spread of cancer cells in people with cancers with BRAF, KRAS, or NRAS gene mutations. Dabrafenib and trametinib have been used in the treatment for other cancers in other research studies, and information from those research studies suggest that these agents may help to kill multiple myeloma cells.\n\nDabrafenib and trametinib, which are investigated in this research study may or may not kill myeloma cells effectively. We would like to see if these drugs given alone or in combination safely and effectively kill these cancer cells.",

At the time of a successful revascularization procedure or up to 14 days following the procedure, participants will be randomized and administered the first dose of inclisiran or corresponding placebo in a 1:1 fashion, stratified by the type of index arterial revascularization procedure, either coronary (i.e., PCI) or lower extremity (i.e., PV).\n\nThe enrollment population will be representative of typical patients in the US with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, either coronary artery disease (CAD) or peripheral artery disease (PAD), and the trial endpoints are designed to be scientifically relevant and clinically meaningful to patients, clinicians, and other persons involved in the care of cardiovascular patients. The trial is designed to also understand how inclisiran therapy can be implemented in real-world clinical practice settings.\n\nThe expected enrollment of the trial is approximately 6,000 participants, randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive inclisiran or placebo, within 14 days of successful percutaneous coronary or lower extremity peripheral endovascular intervention for symptomatic atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).\n\nInclisiran sodium or corresponding placebo will be administered by s.c. injection to participants presenting for percutaneous coronary or peripheral endovascular intervention, in addition to usual care according to their individual medical history. All participants randomized to the treatment arm will receive inclisiran in addition to usual care per their regular physician direction, and those participants randomized to placebo will receive matching placebo, as well as usual care treatment, according to their treating physician.\n\nStudy duration is determined by event accrual consistent with the event-driven design, i.e., when approximately 2380 primary composite events have occurred and at least 50% of participants have at least 36 months of follow-up. Assuming 18 months of recruitment at a uniform rate, the last patients enrolled will have about 27 months of follow-up. Therefore, study duration should be approximately 4 years.\n\nThe study is event-driven, and thus, all participants will be treated (or followed in the case of permanent discontinuation of study drug) until the End of Study visit. As such, the planned duration of treatment cannot be stipulated for an individual participant. The estimated maximum treatment period for an individual participant is approximately 45 months, and the mean treatment duration is expected to be approximately 36 months.",

During the last decades, a therapeutic challenge was to overcome the tumor's resistance to endocrine therapy (ET). Thanks to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of this resistance, effective new treatments have been developed, such as Kisqali\u00ae (ribociclib), a molecularly targeted therapy. This treatment blocks the growth and division of cancer cells by blocking proteins called CDK4/6 located inside the cell. This treatment, taken in combination with ET, blocks the harmful effect of hormones (estrogen) on cancer cell proliferation, and represent the standard first-line treatment of patients with HR+/HER2- mBC.\n\nBut, as with any treatment, it is expected that some patients will have a good response and their disease will be stabilized or even in remission, while other patients will not benefit from treatment and will relapse. In order to make progress, it is necessary to identify pre-therapeutic markers predictive of response to this treatment and the molecular mechanisms of this resistance set up by the tumor before or under the effect of the treatment.\n\nThe Trans-RosaLEE study aims to fill this gap by providing high-throughput molecular profiling (DNA and RNA) of a collection of tumor and blood samples from patients with RH+/HER2- mBC scheduled to start treatment with Kisqali\u00ae + ET. Samples will be collected just prior to initiation of therapy (pre-therapy) and just after discontinuation of therapy in the event of disease progression (post-therapy).\n\nThe main objectives of the TransRosaLEE study are :\n\n* to determine if Kisqali\u00ae + ET treatment causes changes in the DNA and/or RNA genes of tumor;\n* to identify whether there is a molecular signature that would predict clinical outcome of patients treated with Kisqali\u00ae + ET (tumor response, survival);\n* to identify alterations in tumor's genes that could be targeted by a specific treatment and that would allow, in case of progression of the disease, to set up a new adapted treatment.\n\nThe TransRosaLEE study is a collaborative study between the Paoli-Calmettes Institute (France, Marseille) and the pharmaceutical group Novartis. It will take place in up to 90 healthcare institutions in France, and 241 patients will be enrolled. It is closely linked to the non-interventional study RosaLEE promoted by Novartis.",

The safety and toxicity of 177Lu-DOTATATE as adjuvant therapy will also be described.\n\nAdditionally, the clinical use of blood and urine analysis test (NETest) will be evaluated to identify microscopic remaining disease and detect early the return of the tumour.",
    "detailed_description": "There will be 2 arms: arm A consisting of best supportive care and arm B, the experimental treatment. Randomisation will be 1:1 as soon as possible after the liver surgery.\n\nThe control arm will consist of standard of care. The study will be embedded within the regular clinical pathway for treatment and follow-up of patients with resectable NE LM. The follow-up will be according to current guidelines (e.g., Guidelines of the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society for the management of advanced intestinal NET and pancreatic NET with locoregional and/or distant metastases). Patients will be followed up in the study for 3 years according to standard post-surgical follow-up protocol and thereafter in their local institution life-long according to follow-up after liver resection for NE LM.\n\nIn the treatment arm 177Lu-DOTATATE will be applied. The first cycle will be applied 6\u00b12 weeks after liver resection. The frequency of administration will be 2 cycles (8\u00b11weeks between each cycle). The rationale for 2 cycles in the adjuvant setting instead of 4 (as per standard protocol in palliative setting), assumes that after the removal of the primary tumour and the liver metastases, there will be no macroscopic residual tumour. Thus, the treatment dose should be sufficient to target microscopic disease and have the smallest possible effect on healthy tissue.\n\nIn the treatment arm, the patients will have 10 study visits for post -PRRT monitoring (blood tests and clinical assessments). Patients in the standard of care arm will have visits every 3 months. In both arms, patients will have one screening visit and one end of study visit. They will complete QoL questionnaires at baseline and at follow-up visits at 12, 24, and 36 months and bloods/urine will be collected for translational research prior to surgery (while in hospital) and at 6, 12, and 36 months.\n\nSignature of informed consent precedes all study-specific assessments. All patients will have a fresh tumour sample collected during the liver surgery. Disease recurrence will be measured in all patients using liver MRIs every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months for the second to third year and 68Ga DOTA-TATE PET CT every 12 months for 3 years. Any patient with disease recurrence ceases treatment and assessments and will proceed to standard of care treatment for recurrent liver metastases.\n\nFollow-up data will be collected for 5 years overall from the date of randomisation of the last patient.",

This causes the bone marrow to stop making red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells. Standard treatment for this disease is horse-ATG and cyclosporine, which suppress the immune system and stop it from attacking the bone marrow. However, this treatment does not work in all people. Some people still have poor blood cell counts even after treatment.\n* Eltrombopag is a drug designed to mimic a protein in the body called thrombopoietin. It helps the body to make more platelets. It may also cause the body to make more red and white blood cells. Studies have shown that eltrombopag may be useful when added to standard treatment for severe aplastic anemia. It may help improve poor blood cell counts.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- To test the safety and effectiveness of adding eltrombopag to standard immunosuppressive therapy for severe aplastic anemia.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- Individuals at least 2 years of age who have severe aplastic anemia that has not yet been treated.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood tests. Blood and urine samples will be collected.\n* Participants will start treatment with horse-ATG and cyclosporine. Treatment will be given according to the standard of care for the disease.\n* Cohort 1: After 14 days, participants will start taking eltrombopag. They will take eltrombopag for up to 6 months.\n* Cohort 2: After 14 days, participants will start taking eltrombopag. They will take eltrombopag for up to 3 months.\n* Cohort 3 and Extension Cohort: Participants will start taking eltrombopag on Day 1.

Participants will also fill out questionnaires about their symptoms and their quality of life.",
    "detailed_description": "Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a life-threatening bone marrow failure disorder characterized by pancytopenia and a hypocellular bone marrow. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation offers the opportunity for cure in younger patients, but most are not suitable candidates for transplantation due to advanced age or lack of a histocompatible donor. Comparable long-term survival in SAA is attainable with immunosuppressive treatment with horse anti-thymocyte globulin (h-ATG) and cyclosporine (CsA). However, of those patients treated with h-ATG/CsA, one quarter to one third will not respond, and 30-40% of responders relapse. The majority of the hematologic responses observed following initial h-ATG/CsA are partial, with only a few patients achieving normal blood counts. Furthermore, analysis of our own extensive clinical data suggests that poor blood count responses to a single course of ATG (non-robust responders), even when transfusion-independence is achieved, predicts a worse prognosis than when robust hematologic improvement is achieved (protocol 90-H-0146). The explanation for partial recovery and relapse are not fully understood, but incomplete elimination of auto-reactive T cells and insufficient stem cell reserve are both possible. Furthermore, 10-15% of SAA patients treated with standard immunosuppression will develop an abnormal karyotype in follow-up, with monosomy 7 being most common, which portends progression to myelodysplasia and leukemia. In contrast, malignant clonal evolution is rare in complete responders to immunosuppression. Although horse ATG/CsA represented a major advance in the treatment of SAA, refractoriness, incomplete responses, relapse, and clonal evolution limit the success of this modality. Thus, newer regimens are needed to address these limitations, and provide a better alternative to stem cell transplantation.\n\nOne approach to augment the quality of hematologic responses is to improve underlying stem cell function. Previous attempts to improve responses in SAA with hematopoietic cytokines including erythropoietin, G-CSF, and stem cell factor, have failed. Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the principal endogenous regulator of platelet production. In addition, TPO also has stimulatory effects on more primitive multilineage progenitors and stem cells in vitro and in animal models. Eltrombopag (Promacta ), an oral 2nd generation small molecule TPO-agonist, is currently approved for treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), chronic hepatitis C-associated thrombocytopenia, and severe aplastic anemia who have had an insufficient response to immunosuppressive therapy. Eltrombopag increases platelets in healthy subjects and in thrombocytopenic patients with chronic ITP and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Our Branch recently completed a pilot study of eltrombopag in refractory SAA. We saw encouraging clinical results in a cohort of patients who have failed on average two prior immunosuppressive regimens (Olnes et al. ASH Annual Meeting Abstracts, San Diego, CA, 2011, oral presentation and N Engl J Med 2012;367:11-9.1). Of the twenty-five SAA patients treated with eltrombopag by mouth for three months, eleven (44%) patients met protocol criteria of clinically meaningful hematologic responses, without significant toxicity. Nine patients demonstrated an improvement in thrombocytopenia (\\>20k/ L increase or transfusion independence), hemoglobin improved in two patients (\\>1.5g/dL or achieved transfusion independence, and four patients had a significant response in their neutrophil count. When responders continued the drug beyond three months, the hematologic response to eltrombopag increased; a trilineage response was observed in four patients, and a bilineage response occurred in another four, with median follow-up of 13 months. These results suggest that stem cell depletion, a major component of the pathophysiology of SAA, might be directly addressed by eltrombopag administration. The aim of the current study would be to improve the hematologic response rate and its quality, as well as prevent late complications such as relapse and clonal progression, by addition of eltrombopag to standard immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nThis trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining eltrombopag with standard hATG/CSA as first line therapy in patients with SAA. The primary endpoint will be the rate of complete hematologic response at six months. Secondary endpoints are relapse, robust hematologic blood count recovery at 3, 6, and 12 months, survival, clonal evolution to myelodysplasia and leukemia, marrow stem cell content and hematological response of relapse patients that re-start treatment.",

    "detailed_description": "Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is tuberculosis that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most important drugs in treating TB. In 2017, approximately 558,000 new people were estimated to have developed MDR-TB, and 8.5% of the cases had extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB).(1) Current WHO-endorsed MDR-TB treatment regimens take 9-20 months to complete and are associated with substantial toxicity, including deafness from injectable agents, hepatitis from pyrazinamide and severe neuropathy from linezolid. Given the long duration and toxicities of MDR-TB regimens, it is perhaps not surprising that WHO reports that only 25% of patients with MDR-TB are enrolled into WHO-endorsed treatment regimens. Thus, there is an urgent need for shorter, less toxic treatments for MDR-TB. This proposal will determine the efficacy, safety, tolerability and optimal duration of a novel, all oral MDR-TB treatment regimen while addressing three major challenges with innovations that have the potential to transform future trials.\n\nThe proposed DRAMATIC (Duration Randomized Anti-MDR-TB And Tailored Intervention Clinical) Trial is a multicenter, randomized, partially blinded, four-arm, phase 2 trial that will examine an injectable- and pyrazinamide-sparing regimen of bedaquiline, delamanid, levofloxacin, linezolid, and clofazimine. The DRAMATIC regimen limits the administration of linezolid to the initial 8 weeks of treatment, the window before linezolid-related neuropathy occurs. Animal and human studies provide evidence for the potential efficacy of this 5-drug regimen, but the optimal duration of treatment remains uncertain.(2-4)\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\n1. Describe the relationship between the duration of the experimental regimen and the proportion of participants with sustained cure at 76 weeks after randomization without treatment failure or relapse.\n2. Describe the relationship between baseline prognostic risk strata and sustained cure at 76 weeks after randomization without treatment failure or relapse.\n3. Evaluate the association between novel biologic markers and sustained cure at 76 weeks after randomization without treatment failure or relapse.\n\n   Secondary Objectives:\n4. Identify the shortest duration of the study regimen that has acceptable safety and efficacy for a Phase 3 clinical trial of the DRAMATIC regimen for treatment of MDR-TB.\n5. Describe the frequency, magnitude, time course of and risk factors for QTc prolongation associated with the study regimen.\n6. Demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of implementing the new duration-randomized design in a multi-centre randomized trial of drug-resistant TB.\n7. Determine if time to sputum culture conversion predicts optimal duration of treatment when stratified by extent of disease.\n8. Describe the relationship between the duration of the experimental regimen and the proportion of participants with sustained cure at 104 weeks after randomization without treatment failure or relapse.\n9. Assess vital status at 132 weeks post randomization.\n\nDevelopment of a shorter, better-tolerated treatment regimen will greatly enhance the ability of TB control programs to treat the growing number of patients. The DRAMATIC Trial will employ an innovative and efficient new design to establish a robust, nontoxic MDR-TB treatment regimen and identify the minimal duration for which it needs to be administered. These results will speed the process of moving forward to a confirmatory phase 3 clinical trial and increase the likelihood that such a trial is successful.",

    "detailed_description": "Due to highly effective antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV (PLWH) in Switzerland have a close-to-normal life expectancy. Among PLWH, there has been a shift of focus from HIV-related health issues to non communicable diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and cancer. Smoking, a prominent risk factor for both diseases, takes a key role in view of the high number of smokers among PLWH.\n\nNew approaches to smoking cessation focus on harm reduction by substituting tobacco cigarettes by less harmful alternatives. Conventional nicotine replacement therapy like nicotine patches is well established and effective against withdrawal symptoms after quitting. However, these products are exceptionally expensive and the missing \"nicotine hit\" often limits therapy adherence. The long-term abstinence rate remains low. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and nicotine pouches as alternative nicotine replacement therapies have the potential to overcome these problems and are accessible.\n\nE-cigarettes play a growing role in smoking cessation therapy. Evidence from randomized trials shows superiority over conventional nicotine replacement therapies, which is probably based on the better imitation of the smoking experience. Although e-cigarettes are not without concerns, there is consensus that they are significantly less harmful than tobacco cigarettes.\n\nTobacco-free nicotine pouches, delivering nicotine through oral mucosa, are a relatively novel option for nicotine substitution. Similar to e-cigarettes, nicotine pouches are relatively affordable and can address the limitation of poor imitation of the \"nicotine hit\" seen with traditional nicotine replacement therapy. To the best of our knowledge, no trials have investigated the potential of nicotine pouches for smoking cessation so far.\n\nWith this trial, the investigators also want to address frequent shortcomings of smoking cessation trials, such as restrictive inclusion criteria and highly controlled interventions, by RETUNE Version 1.1, January 06, 2025 10/45 offering a menu of different tobacco smoking substitutional products (e-cigarettes or nicotine pouches or nicotine patches) and by using a novel pragmatic trial design, the Trials within Cohorts (TwiCs) design. The investigators plan to recruit tobacco smokers in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS), regardless of their willingness to quit. This so called \"opt-out-approach\" has been suggested as a new promising approach for smoking cessation trials to increase generalizability of the results. The TwiCs design optimally allows to implement and evaluate the \"opt-out\" approach embedded in the SHCS.",

Trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as hydroxychloroquine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving trametinib together with hydroxychloroquine may work better in treating patients with pancreatic cancer.",

A \\<4 week pretreatment with hydroxyurea is permitted. Patients treated for \\<6 weeks with nilotinib 300 mg BID, imatinib 400 mg QD, dasatinib 100 mg QD or without any therapy are eligible for recruitment and will be allocated to the respective cohort. All patients must provide written informed consent to be enrolled in the trial. Cohorts were designed to allow assessment of QD and BID asciminib based combinations to optimize quality of life and compliance. Patients will not be randomized. In general, cohorts will be filled consecutively. Asciminib therapy will be commenced 12 weeks after start of nilotinib, imatinib or dasatinib and after recovery of hematopoiesis or in case of no therapy so far 6 weeks after diagnosis as first line treatment. Referred patients already treated with imatinib, nilotinib or dasatinib will remain on the initial drug and will be allocated to the respective cohort.",
    "detailed_description": "Despite the dramatic progress made over the past decade with TKIs in the treatment of CML, allogeneic stem cell transplant remains the only proven curative therapy. To achieve cure or benefit from treatment-free remissions with pharmacologically-based therapies, it is estimated that patients will likely need to achieve a sustained reduction in tumor burden corresponding to a deep molecular response of at least 4 logs (MR4). Currently, only 30.8% of patients achieve a deep molecular response after 12 months of treatment with single agent nilotinib.\n\nThe development of the novel and potent BCR-ABL1 allosteric inhibitor, asciminib, presents an opportunity to assess the effect of a different mechanism of inhibition of BCR-ABL1 in the first-line treatment of CML to enhance speed of response and to increase the patient population benefitting from deep molecular response. Dosing a combination of asciminib with an ATP-site inhibitor also has the potential to prevent the emergence of resistance due to point mutations being acquired in one of the binding sites.\n\nThe safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of asciminib as a single agent and in combination with either nilotinib or imatinib or dasatinib was assessed in a phase-I study. At the doses chosen here, all three combination treatments were well tolerated.\n\nSince in all patient cohorts the standard of care therapy will remain the backbone of initial therapy, there is no reason to expect an efficacy problem with the combination therapies.",

    "detailed_description": "The new drug being tested in the study, HRO761, is an oral drug that acts on a protein called Werner (WRN), which may contribute to cancer growth. By acting on WRN, HRO761 may be able to stop the growth of the cancer.\n\nThis is the first time HRO761 is given to patients and the first time HRO761 is used in combination with pembrolizumab or irinotecan.\n\nPembrolizumab and irinotecan are drugs approved in several countries and used as standard treatment for certain types of cancer (e.g., colon cancer and small cell lung cancer).\n\nThis research study will consist of various treatment arms to investigate HRO761 as single agent and in the combinations.\n\nFor HRO761 single agent, the research will be done in two parts. The first part is called \"dose escalation\" and the second part is called \"dose optimization\". In the dose escalation part, different groups of people will be given different doses of HRO761 to understand how the body reacts to different doses of the drug and how well the drug acts against the cancer. During the dose optimization part, the selected doses will be tested in more patients until a recommended dose(s) is found.\n\nThe combinations of HRO761 with pembrolizumab or irinotecan also will be tested in a dose escalation part to find the recommended doses of HRO761 in these combinations.\n\nOnce the recommended doses are determined, more people may be treated with HRO761 alone or together with pembrolizumab or irinotecan to further assess the study treatment effects against various types of MSIhi or dMMR cancers. This part is called dose expansion.\n\nFor this research, a number of blood and tissue samples will be collected during the study. Patients may be asked to come approximately 8 times to the clinic during the first 8 weeks and approximately every 2 or 4 weeks thereafter.\n\nPatients will be in the study as long as their study doctor believes that they may be benefiting from the study treatment, unless the patient decides to stop study treatment.",

All comparator TKIs will be made available, unless not permitted by local regulations or local Health Authority, or not approved for the treatment of CML in the country.\n\nApproximately 402 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to asciminib and Investigator selected TKI.\n\nRandomization will be stratified based on the following two stratification factors:\n\n* ELTS score (low versus intermediate versus high)\n* Pre-randomization selected TKI (imatinib versus 2G TKI (nilotinib or dasatinib or bosutinib)).\n\nPrior to randomization, the Investigator, in consultation with the patient, considering the current treatment paradigm and patient characteristics and comorbidities, will make a selection of preference for imatinib or 2G TKI (nilotinib or dasatinib or bosutinib) if the patient is randomized to the comparator arm. The stratified randomization based on these two stratification factors will help to achieve a balance across the treatment arms for the possible comorbidities and baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the study.\n\nTo further ensure that the distribution of patients, between imatinib and 2G TKIs (nilotinib or dasatinib or bosutinib), in the Investigator selected TKI arm is reflective of the use of these agents in clinical practice, the enrollment into the strata of imatinib versus 2G TKI (nilotinib or dasatinib or bosutinib) based on the pre-randomization selection of TKI will be managed by Interactive Response Technology to be approximately 50% versus 50%.\n\nTreatment arms: The study will have 2 treatment arms:\n\n* Arm 1: asciminib 80 mg QD under fasting conditions\n* Arm 2: Investigator selected TKI that will include one of the below treatments:\n* Imatinib 400 mg QD administered with food\n* Nilotinib 300 mg BID administered under fasting conditions\n* Dasatinib 100 mg QD administered with or without meal\n* Bosutinib 400 mg QD administered with food.\n\nNo crossover of study treatment across arms and no change of study treatment within the Investigator selected TKI will be allowed.\n\nDuration of Study treatment: Patients on the study will continue to receive the assigned treatment until the End of Study, or until premature discontinuation due to treatment failure, disease progression or intolerance or due to Investigator or participant decision.\n\nDuration of study: The End of Study will occur 5 years from the last patient first treatment in the study.

    "brief_summary": "The Philadelphia chromosome negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) comprise a group of clonal hematological malignancies that are characterized by chronic myeloproliferation, splenomegaly, different degrees of bone marrow fibrosis, and disease-related symptoms including pruritus, night sweats, fever, weight loss, cachexia, and diarrhea. In addition, due to elevated numbers of leucocytes, erythrocytes and/or platelets, the disease course can be complicated by thromboembolic disease, hemorrhage, and leukemic transformation as well as myelofibrosis.\n\nPatients with polycythemia vera (PV) typically harbor an increased number of blood cells from all three hematopoietic cell lineages due to clonal amplification of hematopoetic stem cells, while patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) typically show a predominant expansion of the megakaryocytic lineage. Most patients with PV below the age of 60 years are currently being treated with acetylsalicylic acid +/- phlebotomy only, and patients with low-risk ET have an almost normal life expectancy and often do not require specific treatment. However, PV- as well as ET-patients with a higher risk for complications require cytoreductive treatment. In addition, constitutional symptoms can be unbearable to patients even in the absence of bona fide high risk factors, and these patients may similarly benefit from antineoplastic therapy.",
    "detailed_description": "Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are classical Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) that are characterized by an excess of cells in the peripheral blood, clonal bone marrow hyperplasia, and extramedullary hematopoiesis. The symptoms of these patients may range from asymptomatic disease to symptomatic disease that may significantly affect their activities of daily living, such as severe generalized pruritus, night sweats and fevers, erythromelalgia, bone and muscle pain, weight loss, and fatigue. Moreover, the patients may develop thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications, transition to myelofibrosis (MF), and transformation to acute leukemia. In principle, the only potentially curative therapy for MPNs is allogenic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). However, due to significant transplant-associated morbidity and mortality, this therapeutic option is only applied in exceptional cases of ET or PV. The majority of patients do not qualify for allo-SCT since the risks of this treatment clearly outweigh the potential benefits. Moreover, even with a non-transplantation approach, patients with ET and PV have a life expectancy comparable to or close to healthy age-matched control persons. For patients with standard risk PV, phlebotomy and acetylsalicylic acid are standard of care (target hematocrit below 45 %), while patients with standard risk ET should receive either no specific treatment or acetylsalicylic acid (provided that no microvascular symptoms or secondary acquired von Willebrand syndrome are present).\n\nHowever, in patients who are at high risk to develop thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications (high-risk patients), cytoreductive treatment is generally indicated to prevent these potentially life-threatening complications. In PV and ET, high risk patients are characterized by advanced age (\\> 60 years) and / or a history of thromboembolic or hemorrhagic events {1,2,3}. In ET, a platelet count \\> 1500 x 109/l is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, and thus should result in a platelet lowering treatment {2}. In PV, in addition to the risk-score based therapy, cytoreduction is also required in patients with progressive or marked myeloproliferation (leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, symptomatic splenomegaly, increase of frequency of phlebotomy requirement), or devastating constitutional symptoms {1,2,4}. In Germany, best available therapy (BAT) includes approved drugs such as hydroxyurea (HU; approved for both PV and ET) and anagrelide (approved for second-line treatment of ET) and non-approved options such as alpha-interferon, pipobroman, busulfan (in elderly patients), and radioactive phosphorus (32P). In rare cases, patients may also benefit from splenic irradiation or splenectomy.\n\nRuxolitinib is a JAK1/2-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which has been approved for the treatment of symptomatic myelofibrosis. The compound was shown to be superior to hydroxyurea in reducing splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms. Ruxolitinib is currently studied in phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials for HU-resistant or HU-intolerant PV and ET. The aim of the present study is to assess the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of ruxolitinib treatment vs. BAT in patients with high-risk PV or -ET.",

Cluster randomized clinical trials are the highest quality type of clinical research to test educational and active interventions aimed at changing behaviors or clinical practices.To our knowledge, data from this study will be crucial to leverage LDL-C treatment in Brazil, considering efforts to improve population health. The present study represents one of the first trials testing a quality improvement (QI) intervention targeted to LDL-C reduction in ASCVD patients conducted in a middle-income country. These results will address whether the proposed QI intervention is feasible and effective in these settings. Therefore, this study is a pragmatic cluster randomized trial to assess the effect of a digitally enabled QI intervention on LDL-C control in ASCVD patients. This study will have 2 phases. Phase 1 will be an observational phase prior to randomization of clusters with the objective to assess the baseline LDL-C levels achieved for target patients. Phase 2 will be an interventional phase, in which clusters will be randomized to the digitally enabled quality improvement intervention or usual care, with the objective to assess the effect of a digitally enabled QI intervention on control of LDL-C levels in ASCVD patients.",

    "detailed_description": "Food allergy affects about 15 million people in the United States. This includes 6 million children. The current treatment for food allergy is to avoid eating the foods that may cause an allergic reaction and have medications such as epinephrine (adrenaline) in case of a reaction. However, accidental exposures can be extremely difficult to avoid, particularly if you are allergic to multiple foods. The risks of accidental exposures and life-threatening reactions can place a large burden on patients and their families.\n\nInvestigators in this study would like to learn if omalizumab injections alone or in combination with multi-allergen oral immunotherapy (OIT) will help people with multiple food allergies eat foods to which they are allergic. Oral means that you will take the food allergen (peanut and 2 other foods to which you are allergic) by mouth. If you are allergic to more than 3 foods, this study will only provide OIT for peanut and 2 other foods.\n\nThere are 3 stages to the study:\n\nIn Stage 1, investigators would like to learn:\n\n\u2022 If omalizumab stops or decreases allergic reactions to peanut and other common food allergens after taking it for a length of time.\n\nStage 1 will also have an extra part so that 60 participants will receive omalizumab and everyone (the investigators conducting the research and study participants) will know it. This is why it is called the open label extension. This part of the study will assist investigators in learning if receiving omalizumab for a longer time may work better at decreasing allergic reactions.\n\nIn Stage 2, investigators would like to learn:\n\n\u2022 How a short course of omalizumab combined with Multi-allergen OIT compares with a longer course of omalizumab in decreasing allergic reactions.\n\nIn Stage 3, investigators would like to learn:\n\n\u2022 If, after participants stop both treatments, will they be able to eat the peanut and the 2 other foods in the form that is normally eaten.\n\nIn all stages, investigators would like to learn:\n\n* How safe and effective the treatments are and\n* How the OIT affects the immune system.\n\nParticipation will last up to 56 months (4 years and 8 months).",

The goal of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of this multitargeted approach in breast cancer.",
    "detailed_description": "In postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive and Her2 negative non-metastatic breast cancer, downstaging or the achievement of a complete pathologic remission before definitive surgery has been associated with the lowest risk of recurrence of breast cancer. In order to achieve a better response in these patients in the preoperative setting, this study combines 3 potentially synergistic agents. Letrozole blocks the synthesis of estrogens and, in doing so, deprives the tumor from hormones which drive its growth. Everolimus is a drug that blocks growth factor signaling which is essential for tumor cells to maintain their growth and proliferation. Everolimus has already been shown to work very well in this subtype of breast cancer in the recurrent and metastatic setting. TRC105 is an investigational agent that prevents the formation and growth of new blood vessels that support tumors by providing oxygen and nutrients.\n\nThe study has 2 components. First the investigators will determine the ideal in terms of tolerance combination of doses of the 3 agents. Once the ideal regimen is determined, more patients will be treated with the investigational combination. During this second stage, the investigators will get a preliminary idea of how effective the investigational therapy is. Further studies will need to be done to confirm the efficacy of the investigational combination.",

The standard treatment is 200 millicuries (mCi) of Lutathera per cycle, with potential adjustments for safety per the FDA-approved package insert.\n\nRegardless of the assigned group (investigational treatment or standard treatment), the first treatment is 200 mCi. This is given with amino acids, which is required for this treatment.\n\nParticipants in the standard treatment continue to receive 200 mCi per treatment, with or without adjustment based on package insert instructions, for up to 4 treatments total.\n\nParticipants in the investigational treatment will receive a customized dose of Lutathera, up to 400 mCi per treatment for treatments 2 - 4, in the hopes that escalation will be safe and effective in many patients based on individualized dosimetry.\n\nParticipants randomized to the investigational treatment will receive specialized imaging (SPECT/CT) following administration of Lutathera. This will identify where the Lutathera went and how long it remains there (in the tumors, kidneys, or bone marrow). After the first dose of Lutathera, this imaging is done on the first day of treatment and then once a day for the next 3 to 4 days. Each scan lasts about an hour. Following treatments 2 and 3, this imaging is only done on the first day and then once at about 3 to 4 days after the treatment. There are also blood samples collected to measure the radioactivity in the blood.\n\nAll participants must be actively followed to assess for side effects of therapy as well as treatment outcomes. This means participants must return to the treatment site at 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after the last cycle of therapy. All participants must have a CT scan completed at 6 months after treatment as well.\n\nRadiation side effects can take years to develop.

In Phase I, participants will be assigned to AAA602 or AAA802 dose escalation cohorts to determine the respective maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended dose for Phase II (RP2D). In Phase II, participants will be randomized to one or two investigational arms, i.e., the RP2D of AAA602 or AAA802, or to the control arm. Therefore, Phase II will have two or three treatment arms. In the control arm, participants will be treated with the standard of care (SoC), i.e., they will not receive any neoadjuvant treatment. Supportive care will be allowed.\n\nFollowing the last dose of completed RLT, participants will complete a post-treatment imaging/Safety follow-up visit. Upon discontinuation of RLT, participants will complete an end of treatment (EOT) visit prior to the post-treatment imaging/Safety follow-up visit.\n\nIf participants undergo surgery, the post-treatment imaging/Safety follow-up visit will be performed before undergoing surgery.\n\nAfter surgery, participants will complete a post-surgery visit and enter the LTFU. No adjuvant treatment is allowed between surgery and biochemical recurrence (BCR).\n\nThe investigational treatments in both Phases I and II are neoadjuvant treatment with AAA602 or AAA802 before surgery (RP and PLND). Surgery is to be performed as per the SoC and is not part of the investigational treatment in this study.\n\nThe control treatment in Phase II is SoC, i.e., no neoadjuvant treatment.",

These drugs have been used in other research trials for individuals with solid and hematology malignancies. Past research on PKC412 shows that it blocks the abnormal functioning of an enzyme called FLT3. FLT3 is found in your cells in either a normal (wild type) or genetically changed form and plays a role in the survival and growth of AML cells. RAD001 is an inhibitor of a central growth pathway that involves the protein MTOR. The MTOR pathway is overactive in cancer cells, causing the cells to grow abnormally. By inhibiting the abnormal growth activity of the MTOR pathway, RAD001 slows down and possibly stops the growth of cancer cells.",

This will continue until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached for RAD001.\n* Each cycle of treatment consists of 28 days on an outpatient basis. Participants will receive RAD001 as the assigned schedule and dosage on day 1 and on days 8 through 28 for the first cycle. For all subsequent cycles RAD001 will be taken once daily. Additionally, all participants will take PKC412 twice a day on days 2 through 28 for the first cycle. For all subsequent cycles PKC412 will be taken twice daily.\n* During the course of the trial the following evaluations and procedures will be completed at various times: review of medical history; review of concomitant medications; physical exam; performance status; vital signs; EKG; chest x-ray; blood tests and bone marrow aspirate/biopsy.",

Treatment with ribociclib (400 mg/day; 3 weeks ON and 1 week OFF) in the adjuvant setting will be maintained for 30 months approximately corresponding to 33 cycles. Letrozole treatment duration must be of at least 5 years. Visits during ribociclib treatment will be scheduled every three cycles.

At the end of ribociclib treatment, visits will be every 6 months until 5 years from last patient's surgery.\n\nDuring adjuvant treatment (both responders and non-responders), letrozole can be switched to another aromatase inhibirtor (AI). Tamoxifen is only permitted after the 30-day post ribociclib visit, according to investigator criteria. Maintaining suppression of ovarian function by luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists during adjuvant treatment is mandatory (if AI are taken)/ recommended (if tamoxifen is taken) in premenopausal and men patients unless there is unmanageable toxicity.\n\nAdjuvant hormonal treatment of patients who progress during neoadjuvant Ribociclib will be at the investigator's discretion.\n\nBlood samples for ctDNA will be collected at screening, C2D1, pre-surgery, post-surgery, and every 6 months during the adjuvant period.

    "detailed_description": "Especially for diseases that are not curable such as metastatic breast cancer (MBC), the maintenance of quality of life is one of the main aims of treatments. Adverse events are well-known side effects of any cytostatic treatment and impact the patients' quality of life. Therefore, new treatment options are developed that should stop or at least slow down metastatic spread of cancer without causing negative side effects in terms of high-grade adverse events. For patients with hormone-receptor positive and HER2 positive MBC the combination of HER2-targeted therapy with endocrine therapy has already been proven to be an effective and in many cases valuable alternative to the combination of HER2-targeted therapy with chemotherapy. The high relevance of HER2-neu-targeted/endocrine treatment combinations derives from the fact that potential chemotherapy-related toxicity can be avoided, which in turn positively affects quality of life. Clinical trials suggest an additional benefit when a CDK4/6 inhibitor is added to the combination of endocrine therapy and anti HER2 treatment. DETECT V is a randomized phase III study comparing the safety and efficacy of trastuzumab plus pertuzumab and the CDK 4/6 inhibitor ribociclib in combination with either endocrine therapy or chemotherapy.",

    "detailed_description": "Despite remarkable clinical results with the use of CDK4/6i, breast cancer patients will experience progression of disease requiring alternative treatment options. The optimal sequence of therapy after progression on CDK4/6i has not been established and it depends on multiple factors, including previous regimens, mutational profile, comorbidities, patient preference or disease burden (NCCN v4, 2023). Thus, new targeted treatment modalities are needed for treatment of patients with endocrine-resistant mBC.\n\nThe purpose of this Phase I/II study conducted in participants with ER+/HER2-, gastrin releasing peptide receptor positive (GRPR+) mBC after progression on CDK4/6i-based therapy is:\n\nIn the Phase I (dose escalation part) to determine the recommended doses and regimens of \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB in combination with capecitabine in post-menopausal women and men not requiring gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist.\n\nIn the Phase II (dose optimization part) to evaluate preliminary efficacy across 2 different dose levels and regimens of \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB in combination with capecitabine in adults including pre/peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women, and men, regardless of their need of a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRha).\n\nDuring screening, study participants will receive the radioligand imaging agent \\[68Ga\\]Ga-NeoB for a positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) or PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An additional \\[68Ga\\]Ga-NeoB for PET/CT or PET/MRI will be performed after their last administration of \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB for phase II participants only.\n\nDuring the treatment period participants will be required to attend a site visit approximately every 3 weeks for the first 9 months and every 6 weeks thereafter, on the first day of every cycle (defined as a period of 3 weeks) or every other cycle, respectively, to undergo study treatment administration or dispensing, dosimetry and safety assessments. Tumor assessments are performed every 9 weeks until month 18, every 12 weeks until month 46 and as clinically indicated thereafter, until disease progression. After study treatment discontinuation, participants will be followed up for safety for 8 weeks after their last study treatment administration. Beyond the initial 8 weeks of safety follow-up, all participants will be followed up as per the Schedule of Assessments, for a total of 5 years from their last \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB administration, or until death, lost to follow-up, participant/guardian's or investigator's decision or withdrawal of consent (WoC).\n\nThe end of study is defined as the date of the last visit, scheduled procedure or follow up (or date of death, participant/guardian's or investigator's decision, WoC or lost to follow up, whichever occurs first) of the last participant in the study globally, or at 5 years from the last \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB administration to the last study participant, whichever occurs last.\n\nThis study includes \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB and capecitabine as study treatment and \\[68Ga\\]Ga-NeoB as an imaging agent. Participants will receive \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB in combination with capecitabine (and a GnRHa, where applicable, as per local clinical practice, for pre-/peri-menopausal women and men in the Phase II part only).\n\n\\[68Ga\\]Ga-NeoB is a PET imaging agent being investigated in studies with \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB treatment in patients with tumors overexpressing GRPR, including mBC patients. \\[68Ga\\]Ga-NeoB has shown favorable technical and diagnostic performance to identify GRPR-expressing malignancies, both in preclinical and in clinical studies, with good image quality that allows interpretation.\n\n\\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB has shown high affinity to the GRPR and its ability to target the GRPR expressing tumor has been confirmed in in vivo imaging and biodistribution studies in tumor models. \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB is rapidly cleared from the blood, quickly eliminated through the renal system, with no retention in kidneys. \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB is currently being evaluated as a single agent in an ongoing Phase I/IIa, open-label, multi-center study (NeoRay) which evaluates the safety, tolerability, whole-body distribution, radiation dosimetry and anti-tumor activity of \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB administered in patients with advanced solid tumors known to overexpress GRPR who have no available therapeutic options. Data show that \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB has shown a good tolerability and safety profile and a favorable biodistribution with low uptake in organs considered to be at risk due to GRPR-expression, such as the pancreas, or due to radioligand therapy (RLT), such as the red marrow, and the route of excretion, such as the kidneys.\n\nCapecitabine is an oral fluoropyrimidine carbamate that is converted to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) preferentially in tumor tissue through exploitation of high intratumoral concentrations of thymidine phosphorylase. It is one of the most frequent chemotherapy treatment choices for HR+/HER2- mBC patients post-CDK4/6i failure from 2nd line and beyond as reflected in real word data. It is also considered to be a potent radiosensitizer. The synergistic combination of chemotherapy and radionuclides has the potential to enhance efficacy.\n\nThis study will enroll a total of between 36 and 58 participants, depending on the applicable scenario. In the Phase I part, about 18 participants will be either enrolled or assigned to treatment/randomized (as applicable). In the Phase II part, between 28 and 40 participants will be randomized, depending on the applicable scenario.\n\n* The screening period of 42 days is followed by the treatment period until disease progression, discontinuation of study treatment due to any other reason such as unacceptable toxicity, symptomatic deterioration, WoC, lost to follow up, investigator decision or death, whichever occurs first. The post treatment follow up period comprises the safety follow up for 8 weeks after treatment discontinuation and the long term safety and survival follow up for up to 5 years from the date of the participant's last dose of \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB\n* During screening, each participant will receive \\[68Ga\\]Ga-NeoB for PET/CT or PET/MRI imaging to confirm eligibility. Additionally, within 4-8 weeks from the last administration of \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB, another administration of \\[68Ga\\]Ga-NeoB for PET/CT or PET/MRI will be performed, in the phase II part only.\n* In the phase I part, participants will receive \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB at a starting dose of 150mCi +/- 10% (iv infusion) Q6W in combination with capecitabine (tablet, 1000 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment). If dose escalation is supported, then two higher dose levels of \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB in combination with capecitabine are planned to be explored, in a randomized way: 200mCi Q6W and 100mCi Q3W. These correspond to the same total dose given in a 6 weeks timeframe but exploring a different dose fractionation.\n* If dose escalation from the starting dose is not supported, then lower dose levels will be explored (100mCi Q6W and if shown safe, 100mCi Q3W). If none of these are shown safe then the study will be terminated\n* In the phase II part, there are four potential scenarios that may apply, depending on the outcome of the phase I part:\n* Scenario 1 (if both higher dose levels in phase I were shown safe) participants will be randomized to either \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB 200mCi Q6W or 100mCi Q3W, in combination with capecitabine\n* Scenario 2 (if only one of the two higher dose levels in phase I were shown safe) participants will be randomized to either \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB 200mCi Q6W / 100mCi Q3W (whichever was shown safe in phase I) or 150 mCi Q6W, in combination with capecitabine\n* Scenario 3 (if none of the higher doses in phase I are shown safe): participants will be randomized to either \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB 150mCi Q6W or 100mCi Q6W, in combination with capecitabine\n* Scenario 4 (if dose escalation from the starting dose was no supported in phase I and lower investigational dose levels and regimens are shown safe in phase I part): participants will be randomized to either \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB 100 mCi Q6W or 100 mCi Q3W, in combination with capecitabine.\n* Treatment duration with \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB is 6 administrations for Q6W regimens and 12 administrations for Q3W regimens. Additional \\[177Lu\\]Lu-NeoB administrations may be considered based on an individual benefit-risk assessment performed by the Investigator, participant and Sponsor",

The amount of harvested stem cells will be compared with historical group to see if eltrombopag could increase the amount of harvested stem cells.",
    "detailed_description": "Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) is the standard treatment for many malignant diseases, including plasma cell myeloma, lymphoma and germ-cell tumor. In the USA, it is estimated that 34,920 new cases of myeloma, 81,560 new cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 8830 new cases of Hodgkin lymphoma will be diagnosed annually.\n\nAuto-HSCT is the first line therapy for fit patients with plasma cell myeloma and second line therapy for fit patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma. It significantly prolongs overall survival in patients with myeloma and provides chances of cure in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma. The prerequisite condition to successfully perform an auto-HSCT is to mobilize and harvest an adequate amount of autologous hematopoietic stem cells. Usually, a number of 0.75-2.5 x 10\\^6/kg CD34+ cell is the minimal amount of hematopoietic stem cells required to safely perform an auto-HSCT. Recent study revealed increased amount of CD34+ autologous hematopoietic stem cell dose in auto-HSCT as a predictor of shortened engraftment time and better survival.\n\nBefore PBSC (peripheral blood stem cell) harvest, the hematopoietic stem cells need to be mobilized from bone marrow into the peripheral blood. In patients with malignant diseases, chemo-mobilization is the preferred mobilization method, which consists of chemotherapy 1-2 weeks prior to the harvesting procedure. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is administered after the chemotherapy to facilitate PBSC mobilization. Following chemotherapy and G-CSF, PBSC will be mobilized into peripheral blood for harvest. The concentration of PBSC will be monitored. Once an adequate amount of PBSC is measured, a PBSC harvest procedure will be initiated. The PBSC harvest procedure usually starts 1-2 weeks following chemotherapy, and takes 1-5 days until adequate amounts of PBSC are collected. The more days a harvesting procedure takes, the larger medical risks and costs it possesses.\n\nESHAP is one of the most commonly used chemo-mobilization regimens in National Taiwan University Hospital. The unpublished data from National Taiwan University Hospital revealed that, it took at least 2 days to obtain adequate amount of PBSC for auto-HSCT in 40.84% of patients.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, patients may never obtain adequate amounts of PBSC for auto-HSCT even after 5 days of PBSC harvest or salvage treatment with plerixafor, a stem cell mobilizer agent. Compared to patients who obtained an adequate amount PBSC in the 1st day of stem cell harvest, these patients undertook more risks during harvest procedure and cost more medical expenditure. In addition, plerixafor is an expensive medication ($9,255 USD/each supply) that is conditional reimbursed in Taiwan. It is likely to be unaffordable for patients outside Taiwan or those without reimbursement. Without adequate amounts of harvested stem cells, the standard treatment of lymphoma (auto-HSCT) can't be performed and patient's outcome will be severely compromised. There's an urgent need to increase the percentage of patients gathering an adequate amount of PBSC on the first harvest day.\n\nEltrombopag is a thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist that has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia (2007) and aplastic anemia (2014). It has been proven that TPO agonists can stimulate stem cell proliferation and maintenance. One study showed administration of eltrombopag increased the stem cell amount harvested from patients with plasma cell myeloma. Investigators hypothesized that addition of eltrombopag during ESHAP PBSC mobilization will increase the amount of harvested stem cells in patients with lymphoma.\n\nIn addition, a study in patients with aplastic anemia showed positive correlation of serum eltrombopag concentration with treatment efficacy. A higher peak serum eltrombopag concentration were associated with higher response rate. This raises the interest of measuring serum eltrombopag in this study. The association of serum eltrombopag concentration and harvested PBSC amount will be explored as well.\n\nIn conclusion, this study aimed to explore the activity of eltrombopag in ESHAP PBSC mobilization. Participants will receive eltrombopag following ESHAP chemo-mobilization. The amount of PBSC, and its association with peak serum eltrombopag will be measured.",

Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Zoledronic acid may stop the growth of tumor cells in bone. Giving chemotherapy with or without zoledronic acid before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving these treatments after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known whether giving combination chemotherapy together with zoledronic acid is more effective than combination chemotherapy alone in treating osteosarcoma.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying combination chemotherapy and zoledronic acid to see how well they work compared with combination chemotherapy alone in treating patients with osteosarcoma.",

    "detailed_description": "Most prostate cancers respond to hormone therapy, also known as chemical castration. Unfortunately, castration resistance may occur in certain prostate cancers. Castration resistance or hormone refractory prostate cancer means that the cancer continues to progress as seen by progressively rising PSA and/or or an increase in tumor mass on bone scan, X-ray, CT scan or MRI despite previous hormonal therapy. The researchers are interested in understanding mechanisms of castration resistance in prostate cancer by analyzing prostate tissue before radical prostatectomy (from prostate biopsy tissue) and after radical prostatectomy (whole prostate specimen). They will look at the \"molecular signature\" of prostate cancer cells after hormone therapy to identify the key steps that the cancer cells undergo to become resistant to hormone therapy. In addition, the researchers will use other medications in addition to hormone therapy in order to block some of the key biochemical steps that are thought to mediate treatment resistance.

    "detailed_description": "This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational drug or a combination of drugs. Phase I studies try to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further studies. \"Investigational\" means that the drug and the combination of drugs are still being studied.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the study drugs, ribociclib or everolimus, for relapsed ALL, but these drugs have been approved for other uses.\n\nRibociclib is a chemotherapy drug that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of certain types of breast cancer. It has also been studied in children and adults with other types of cancer. Information from these research studies has suggested that ribociclib may also be effective in treating participants with leukemia that did not respond to standard treatment or participants with leukemia that has come back after standard treatment.\n\nThe growth and survival of leukemia cells is controlled by proteins within the cancer cell. The study drug, ribociclib, blocks a specific type of protein called a cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK). Laboratory and other studies suggest that when ribociclib blocks CDKs, cancer cells stop growing.\n\nEverolimus is a chemotherapy drug that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of breast cancer, neuroendocrine tumor and kidney cancer. Laboratory and other studies suggest that everolimus may prevent leukemia cell growth and also that it has been shown to increase the effectiveness of other chemotherapy drugs, including ribociclib. It has been studied in hundreds of people with various types of cancer as a single agent (a drug that is used alone to treat the cancer) or in combination with a number of other drugs.\n\nThe drug combination of ribociclib and everolimus has not been previously tested in children, though these agents have been used together in adults with breast cancer.\n\nIn this research study the investigators are looking to learn more about how ribociclib and everolimus work in combination with other standard of care drugs commonly used to treat relapsed/refractory leukemia. The main goals of the study are:\n\n* To evaluate the side effects (good and/or bad) of giving ribociclib in combination with other standard of care drugs.\n* To determine the highest dose of ribociclib and everolimus that can be given safely in combination with other standard of care drugs.\n* To determine the amount of ribociclib and everolimus in the blood when it is given in combination with other standard of care drugs.",

Most infants with SCA are born in the low-resource settings of sub- Saharan Africa, where an estimated 50-90% will die before 5 years of age due to lack of early diagnosis and appropriate care. Hydroxyurea is a safe and effective once-daily oral medication that has become the standard of care for the treatment of children with SCA in high-resource settings. There is now a growing body of evidence to support the safety and clinical benefits of hydroxyurea for the treatment of SCA in sub-Saharan Africa. The requirement for frequent laboratory monitoring, uncertainties about appropriate, most effective dosing, and the concern for hematologic laboratory toxicities, however, will continue to limit widespread hydroxyurea utilization and real-world effectiveness. The investigators have recently developed and prospectively evaluated an individualized, pharmacokinetics-guided hydroxyurea dosing strategy for children with SCA that has demonstrated optimal clinical and laboratory benefits with minimal toxicity. In this research study, the investigators aim to extend this precision medicine approach to Africa.",

The study will prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of hydroxyurea with limited laboratory monitoring and will bring precision medicine to children with SCA using several novel features including measurement of hydroxyurea using a battery-powered HPLC machine and individualized dose calculations using an automated computer-based algorithm. The objective of this study is to establish evidence-based guidelines for hydroxyurea in sub-Saharan Africa, including appropriate dosing and laboratory monitoring strategy with the goal of allowing for widespread use of hydroxyurea across sub-Saharan Africa, regardless of clinical or laboratory resources.",

The study also aims to simplify patient access to approved targeted therapies that are contributed to the program by collaborating pharmaceutical companies and to perform next generation sequencing on tumor biopsies for biomarker analyses. Eligible patients have an advanced solid tumor, multiple myeloma or B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma for which standard treatment options are no longer available and acceptable performance status and organ function. A genomic or protein expression test must have been performed on the tumor and the results must identify at least one potentially actionable molecular variant as defined in the protocol. Results from the molecular profiling test will be used to determine an appropriate drug(s) from among those available in the protocol. The choice of drug will be supported by a list of potential profiles, a molecular tumor board, a knowledge library and by study coordinators for review and approval of the match. The protocol-specified treatment will be administered to the patient once any drug-specific eligibility criteria are confirmed and a fresh pre-treatment biopsy is performed for future genetic studies. All patients who receive treatment with a drug available in the protocol will be followed for standard efficacy outcomes including tumor response, progression-free and overall survival as well as duration of treatment. In addition, treatment related toxicity will be evaluated.",
    "detailed_description": "Problem description: evidence is building that matching targeted agents to tumor characteristics can improve outcomes. Such reports have fueled interest among patients and physicians to use molecular testing for treatment planning when standard treatment options have been exhausted. When oncologists aim to provide such personalized treatment to their patients though, obtaining the drugs can be challenging since off-label prescribing, while legal, is generally not reimbursed by insurance companies. Furthermore, outcomes of off-label treatment in routine clinical practice are not systematically recorded. As a result, the research and clinical communities have limited insight in these outcomes, leading to repetitive use of ineffective treatment for some tumor types, while effective treatment strategies might be missed for others. The latter is especially relevant for 'orphan diseases', that are too rare to conduct formal phase II and III trials. In summary, there is a lack of access to potentially effective therapy on one hand, and a lack of knowledge on broader use of such therapies on the other, altogether leading to sub-optimal use of available resources.\n\nEnvisioned solution and study aim: creation of a drug-access program, in which patients are treated with registered targeted therapy matched to their molecular tumor profile, and in which the outcomes of such therapies are recorded systematically, per tumor profile and tumor type (this is important since it is becoming increasingly clear that the tissue of origin is an important determinant of outcome of genetic abnormalities). We hereby aim to improve and broaden the use of registered targeted therapy, whilst facilitating patient access to such therapy.\n\nPlan of investigation: patients will be treated with approved targeted agents, selected based on results of a molecular profiling test of the patient's tumor. Eligible patients will have exhausted standard treatment options, and their tumor must harbor a potentially actionable molecular variant as defined in the protocol. The study will provide a tumor board to help physicians understand the profiling test results and treatment options, and will enable insights about the utility of this approach. In addition, next generation sequencing will be performed on fresh tumor biopsies for additional biomarker discovery. Patients from the Netherlands and the USA will be included in two similar though independent protocols (DRUP and TAPUR), allowing data-exchange and empowering of both trials.\n\nExpected outcome: early signs of clinical activity of approved drugs outside their label, providing effective personalized treatment options, improved patient outcomes and access to targeted therapy.",

    "detailed_description": "The healthcare sector is under tremendous financial pressure but an increase in healthcare spendings does not seem to equate to better health outcomes or quality of care. Therefore, a dramatic shift is required as the current system is not sustainable. Several solutions have been proposed of which the conceptual framework known as value-based healthcare (VBHC) is further explored in this study for psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with a high prevalence of 0.1% to 11%. It is associated with psoriatic arthritis and numerous other comorbidities such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes. Psoriasis also significantly impacts patients' quality of life. The cost associated with managing psoriasis and its comorbidities present a substantial economic burden.\n\nVBHC is a widely known conceptual framework, proposed by Porter and Teisberg, aimed at tackling the ever rising healthcare costs and variation in quality of delivered care. The framework is formulated on the premise that the health care sector should strive to achieve greater value for its patients. Value is defined through an equation in which the achieved patient-relevant outcomes are divided by the costs needed to achieve these outcomes. Both measures of outcomes and costs are looked at for individual patients over the full cycle of care, from the initial consultation to their final consultation, including all other medical interventions for the treatment of the medical disease. Previously, for psoriasis, it was unknown which outcomes actually mattered to patients. Therefore, a value-based outcome set (VOS), consisting of outcomes that matter to psoriasis patients, was first developed. Time-driven activity-based costing (TD-ABC) is the proposed costing method to accurately measure costs within the VBHC framework. Furthermore, in keeping with the VBHC framework, having greater understanding and transparency of costs may help with moving the sector away from the current fee-for-service structure towards VBHC payment initiatives, for example bundled payments. Bundled payments represent a lump sum payment to hospitals for the reimbursement of an entire episode of care for a patient. The payment is allocated to all services and providers across the various care activities (inpatient, post-acute care etc.).\n\nIn VBHC, value is created by using integrated practice units (IPUs). An IPU is an organizational entity that connects multiple specialisms and functions around a medical condition, with a distinct organizational structure, with a coherent set of agreements/contracts, with the aim to maximize value, by delivering maximum (or \"the best possible\") healthcare outcome for patients against minimum possible costs. It includes the full range of medical expertise, technical skills and specialized facilities needed, whilst putting patient experience central, as well as the management and coordination of the IPU and its interfaces. An IPU represents a fundamental part of the implementation of VBHC. The investigators have set up an IPU in psoriasis called PsoPlus, referring to the added value they believe their approach brings to psoriasis management.\n\nThe objective of this study is to investigate the impact of using the VBHC framework for the management of psoriasis. The IRIS (value In psoRiasIS) study will be a prospective clinical trial in which new patients attending the PsoPlus will be followed up during a period of 1 year. Both the outcomes achieved and costs will be assessed during this year. Subsequently, the two will be connected by conducting a data envelopment analysis (DEA) which will result in a value score for each patient. Based on this score and the evolution of this score conclusions can be made about the characteristics of patients that appear to experience more value compared to the other patients and the evolution of this created value over time. Secondary outcomes are related to comorbidity control, individual outcomes and determining cost drivers. In addition, a bundled payment scheme should be determined as well as potential improvements in the treatment process. This project will serve as a pilot project for the Belgium healthcare system.\n\nThe VOS consists of 21 outcomes which are measured using 12 instruments, of which 8 are reported by the patient and 4 by the provider. The following outcomes are measured:\n\n* Symptom control via Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI)\n* Confidence in care via Patient Benefit Index (PBI)\n* Control of disease via Patient Benefit Index (PBI)\n* Treatment efficacy via Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM)\n* Treatment convenience via Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM)\n* Complete clearance via Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) and Body Surface Area (BSA)\n* Almost complete clearance via Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) and Body Surface Area (BSA)\n* Communication with care professional via Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire 9 item (SDM-Q9)\n* Daily activity via Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)\n* Emotional well-being via Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)\n* Intimate relationships via Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)\n* Social activity via Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)\n* Difficult location clearance via Yes/No question in the Belgian Treat-to-Target consensus (T2T)\n* Treatment tolerability via Yes/No question in the Belgian Treat-to-Target consensus (T2T)\n* Treatment sustainability via custom Yes/No question\n* Time to clearance via custom Yes/No question\n* Cost of care (patient) via custom Yes/No question\n* Cost of care (societal) via custom Yes/No question\n* Treatment safety via Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria\n* Productivity via Work Productivity and Activity Impairment - Psoriasis (WPAI-PSO)\n* Comorbidity control via screening",

    "detailed_description": "The Study Drugs:\n\nEverolimus is designed to stop cancer cells from multiplying. It may also stop the growth of new blood vessels that help tumor growth, which may cause the tumor cells to die.\n\nLetrozole is designed to block chemical pathways that are necessary for tumor growth.\n\nStudy Drug Administration:\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take 2 pills of everolimus by mouth 1 time every day. You should not open everolimus until you are about to take it because it absorbs moisture and is sensitive to light. You will also take 1 pill of letrozole by mouth 1 time every day. You should take letrozole at the same time as everolimus.\n\nEverolimus should be taken the same time every day on an empty stomach (fasting state) or after no more than a light, fat-free meal. You should wait at least 6 hours after a eating a regular (not fat-free meal) before taking everolimus. You should not eat fatty foods for at least 1 hour after taking everolimus.\n\nIf you cannot swallow the tablets, the tablets should be dissolved in a glass of about 2 tablespoons of water just before being taken. The tablets should then be stirred gently (for a maximum of 7 minutes) until the tablets are dissolved. The contents should then be drunk. If you vomit after taking the study drug, you should not take another tablet that day. If you forgot to take the drug one day, you should not take an extra dose the next day but instead contact your doctor for advice.\n\nYou will be given a diary where you will record the pills you take each day. You must bring this diary to each visit.\n\nWhile you are on study, you should avoid grapefruit, grapefruit juice, and other products containing grapefruit. There are also certain drugs you cannot take during this study. You should not take any drugs during the study without asking the study doctor first.\n\nStudy Visits:\n\nEvery 4 weeks, the following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and temperature).\n* Your performance status will be recorded.\n* Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, including checking your liver and kidneys and measuring the levels of sugar in your blood, and levels of fat in your blood.\n* You will asked about any side effects you have experienced.\n* If the disease is in the pelvis, you will have a pelvic exam.\n* If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for hepatitis testing.\n* Your pills will be counted.\n\nAt Week 8, the following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n* You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.\n* You will have a CT and/or MRI scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Other areas will be scanned if the doctor thinks it is needed.\n* Any tumors will be measured. The doctor will either feel the tumor or a CT, x-ray, and/or MRI will be used.\n* If the disease is in your chest, you will have chest CT and/or MRI scan to check the status of the disease.\n* You will asked about any side effects you have experienced.\n\nAfter the Week 8 Visit, you will have the following tests and procedures. (If the disease has partially or completely responded to the study drugs, these tests will be done around Week 12. If the disease is stable, these tests will be done around Week 16.)\n\n* You will have a physical exam.\n* You will have a CT and/or MRI scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Other areas will be scanned if the doctor thinks it is needed.\n* Any tumors will be measured. The doctor will either feel the tumor or a CT scan, x-ray, and/or MRI will be used.\n* If the disease is in your chest, you will have a chest CT and/or MRI scan to check the status of the disease.\n\nAfter the Week 12 or 16 visit, every 12 weeks, the following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n* You will have a pelvic exam.\n* You will have a CT and/or MRI scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Other areas will be scanned if the doctor thinks it is needed.\n\nI-f the disease is in your chest, you will have chest CT and/or MRI scan to check the status of the disease.\n\nLength of Study:\n\nYou may continue receiving additional cycles of study treatment. You will be taken off study if you experience intolerable side effects, the disease gets worse, the disease completely responds, or the doctor thinks it is in your best interest.\n\nEnd of Treatment Visit:\n\nWithin 4 weeks after the last dose of study drugs, you will have an end-of-treatment visit. At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.\n* You will have a pelvic exam.\n* Your performance status will be recorded.\n* Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, including checking your liver and kidneys and measuring the levels of sugar in your blood, and levels of fat in your blood.\n* You will have a CT and/or MRI scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Other areas will be scanned if the doctor thinks it is needed.\n* If the disease is in your chest, you will have chest CT and/or MRI scan to check the status of the disease.\n* Your pills will be counted and any unused study drug will be returned.\n\nLong Term Follow-up:\n\nAfter you are off study, you will be followed by your doctor on a regular basis. How often these visits occur are up to you and your doctor. The following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.\n* You will have a pelvic exam.\n* Your performance status will be recorded.\n* You will be asked if you have experienced any intolerable side effects.\n* You will have a CT and/or MRI scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Other areas will be scanned if the doctor thinks it is needed.\n* If the disease is in your chest, you will have chest CT and/or MRI scan to check the status of the disease.\n\nThis is an investigational study. Everolimus is not FDA approved or commercially available. At this time, everolimus is only being used in research. Letrozole is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The combination of everolimus and letrozole in this study for the treatment of endometrial cancer is also investigational. Up to 42 patients will take part in the multicenter study. Up to 42 will be enrolled at MD Anderson.",

The primary endpoint of confirmed overall response rate (ORR) was analyzed with participants in this part and was assessed via independent centralized review of radiographic images provided by the Investigator and as outlined in PCWG3-modified RECIST v1.1 criteria.\n2. Extension part: The extension part enrolled additional 30 participants with or without measurable lesions following the main part. The secondary endpoints were analyzed with all participants in both main part and extension part.\n\nScreening and enrollment period:\n\nWritten informed consent form (ICF) was obtained prior to any screening procedures. All screening procedures described in the Assessment Schedule were completed within 28 days prior to enrollment, except for radiographic imaging assessment, which was done within 21 days prior to enrollment.\n\nThe participants were assessed for eligibility and underwent a mandatory \\[68Ga\\]Ga-PSMA-11 Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/Computed Tomography (CT) scan to evaluate Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) positivity for eligibility as assessed by central readers. Only participants with PSMA positive cancer and confirmed eligibility criteria were enrolled.\n\nFollowing completion of all required screening procedures and verifying participant eligibility, the participant was enrolled. \\[177Lu\\]Lu-PSMA-617 was ordered in parallel with interactive response technology (IRT) enrollment registration to allow at least 2 weeks to order and deliver \\[177Lu\\]Lu-PSMA-617.\n\nTreatment period:\n\nIn principle, all participants should begin \\[177Lu\\]Lu-PSMA-617 dosing within 14 days after enrollment registration. However, Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) could be delayed by up to an additional 3 days only for unexpected scheduling delays. Participants received 7.4 Gigabecquerel (GBq) (200 Millicuries (mCi)) +/- 10% \\[177Lu\\]Lu-PSMA-617 once every 6 weeks for a planned 6 cycles. BSC/BSoC coud be used, including available care for the eligible participants according to best institutional practice. ARPIs (e.,g., abiraterone, etc.) were allowed. BSC/BSoC for each participant was selected at the discretion of the Investigator prior to \\[177Lu\\]Lu-PSMA-617 administration, and could be modified over time as needed. BSC/BSoC was administered per the physician's orders according to clinical best practice.\n\nRadiographic imaging (CT with contrast/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and bone scan) was done at every 8 weeks (\u00b1 4 days) after first dose of \\[177Lu\\]Lu-PSMA-617 for the first 24 weeks (independent of dose delays), then every 12 weeks (\u00b1 4 days) thereafter and at End of Treatment (EOT) Visit (if not done within 28 days of EOT) until radiographic disease progression confirmed by central reader, death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or subject/guardian's decision.\n\nAfter the last day of study treatment period of \\[177Lu\\]Lu-PSMA-617 (i.e. after completion of 6 cycles of treatment OR treatment discontinuation for any reason) \\[e.g. upon radiographic progression as confirmed by blinded independent centralized review\\]), the participants have to have an EOT visit performed \u2264 7 days and enter into the Post-treatment Follow-up period.\n\nIf a participant withdrew consent for the treatment period of the study, an EOT is supposed to be done and the participant would enter into the Post-treatment Follow-up unless he specifically withdrew consent for post-treatment follow-up.\n\nPost-treatment Follow-up period:\n\n1. 30-day Safety Follow-up. All treated participants are to have a safety follow-up conducted approximately 30 days after EOT visit.\n2. Long term Follow-up. The long-term follow-up would start after the 30-day Safety follow-up and would last until study completion. If a participant in the long-term follow-up period discontinued treatment for reasons other than BICR-determined radiographic progression, his tumor assessments were required to be performed every 8 weeks after first dose of study treatment for the first 24 weeks (week 9, 17, 25) and then every 12 weeks (week 37, 49, etc) until confirmation of radiographic progression by BICR. The long-term follow-up period also includes the collection of survival and treatment updates, patient reported outcomes (PROs), serious adverse events (suspected to be related to study treatment), as well as blood sampling for hematology, chemistry testing, coagulation, and PSA.

    "detailed_description": "Immunotherapies have revolutionized medical oncology following the remarkable and, in some cases, unprecedented outcomes observed in certain groups of patients with cancer. However results in adults and mainly in pediatric cancer are still disappointing. One hypothesis is that the tumor micro-environment (TME) - characterized by hypoxia, a low pH, and a high interstitial fluid pressure - can reduce the effectiveness of virtually all types of anticancer therapies, including immunotherapy. In adults, combination with other therapeutic modalities, including anti-angiogenic agents, is one of the many strategies currently under investigation to improve the response rates and duration of immunotherapies.\n\nModulators of angiogenesis, such as VEGF, have a broad range of diverse effects on the immune system and the tumor micro-environment that are mainly immunosuppressive. In patients with early-stage disease, anti-VEGF therapy can lead to antitumor effects by modulating immune mechanisms - provided that therapy is maintained for an adequate length and tumors are sufficiently immunogenic. Nevertheless, blocking angiogenic molecules using a strategy based on a single therapeutic approach is likely insufficient to generate a complete or robust immune response against cancer, especially in patients with advanced-stage disease. Therefore, such anti-angiogenic agents will likely need to be used in combination with various immunotherapeutic strategies that boost adaptive immune responses, such as those described in the next sections. For these reasons, the investigators proposed to combine immunotherapy and low dose of pazopanib to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in some selected pediatric patients and adults.\n\nPDR001 (also referred to as spartalizumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against human programmed death-1 (PD-1) that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2).\n\nPazopanib is a potent, selective, oral, ATP competitive multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) -1, -2, and -3, c-kit, and platelet-derived growth factor receptors. It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma and soft tissue sarcoma (STS) in adults. Based on the results of previous studies which evaluated the safety profile of spartalizumab, of pazopanib and the combination of antiangiogenic agents with checkpoint inhibitors, a study combining spartalizumab and low-dose pazopanib in refractory or relapsed solid tumors of pediatric and adults is proposed.

However, the optimum number of cycles of 177Lu-PSMA in patients who show good response remains unknown. Some patients may benefit from more than 6 cycles of therapy. Additionally, some patients experience a complete or almost complete response before the last cycle. It is unclear whether these patients benefit from the subsequent remaining treatment cycle(s). A treatment holiday period would spare these patients some exposure to the therapy agent and avoid potentially unnecessary toxicity when treatment efficacy is already maximal and additional treatment effect cannot be expected. This randomized phase 2 study compares a group of patients treated with LuPSMA on a flexible and extended dosing schedule including \"treatment holiday\" periods (investigational arm, up to 12 cycles, as described below) to a control group treated with a fixed dosing schedule of 6 treatments cycles maximum administered every 6 weeks. The flexible dosing schedule in the investigational arm will be based on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) response assessments obtained 24h after injection of LuPSMA therapy cycle. The response assessment during treatment holiday period will be based on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) every 12 weeks.

Where multiple targets are identified in one patient, or where multiple potential therapies would be appropriate for a single tumour mutation, the treating clinician may determine the appropriate therapeutic approach after consultation with the study team, using the latest version of library of matched therapies.",
    "detailed_description": "Current standard of care testing covers mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes. The comprehensive gene testing platform to be used in this project is designed to interrogate the entire coding sequence of 315 cancer-related genes plus introns from 28 genes often rearranged or altered in cancer. These genes are known to be somatically altered in solid cancers based on recent scientific and clinical literature. The test panel will be used on melanoma tissue from patients pre-screened as having BRAF and NRAS wild-type melanoma. The extent of testing will be updated to reflect new discoveries in melanoma tumourigenesis and availability of new therapies as the project proceeds. Testing will be performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples of metastatic tissue. Archival tissue from primary or regional recurrent melanoma may be considered if no recent sample is available or possible.\n\nAll new patients with unresectable Stage III or IV melanoma seen at each participating site will be invited to participate. Following written consent, all patients will undergo the standard testing for BRAF and NRAS mutations. Patients found to have mutations in either gene will receive standard treatment with dabrafenib and / or trametinib and no further molecular testing.\n\nPatients with wild type versions of BRAF and NRAS genes will have tumour tissue sent for the extended gene testing platform. These patients will first receive standard of care therapy for wild type BRAF / NRAS melanoma, where possible. Once standard therapies have been exhausted (because of disease progression or intolerable adverse events), patients will then receive a targeted therapy matched for their genetic result, if applicable. The selection of targeted therapy will be based on clinical evidence of activity in other solid tumours harbouring similar mutations and / or in at least Phase I testing in melanoma. The table of matched therapies will be modified and extended as new findings from clinical research become available. Patients may be included in specific clinical trials of targeted therapies if available, e.g. a MEK inhibitor combined with an MDM2 inhibitor (AMG232) for BRAF and TP53 wild-type melanoma or a MEK inhibitor combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor for BRAF wild-type melanoma.\n\nThe extensive molecular profiling platform is fully validated and will be conducted by an external provider accredited by an authority with the responsibility to award Laboratory Accreditation at private and public facilities.",

    "detailed_description": "Acute myeloid leukemia is a malignancy that is still fatal for the majority of patients. Besides age, the genetic configuration of AML blasts is one of the strongest prognostic factors. Patients with mutations in the core-binding factor (CBF) genes have the best prognosis, however a considerable proportion of 35-60% will eventually relapse. Mutation and overexpression of receptor tyrosinkinases (RTK) have been proposed as main reasons for relapse development or chemoresistance in CBF AMLs. RTKs like stem cell factor receptor (c-KIT) and FLT3 are of high clinical relevance as they mediate proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. There is evidence that c-Kit mutations and high levels of c-KIT in CBF-AML have adverse effects on survival endpoints indicating c-KIT as potential therapeutic target in this special AML population. Midostaurin can be considered a potent c-KIT inhibitor besides having multi-kinase inhibitory activity for several other kinases of documented or potential pathogenetic relevance for AML, most importantly mutated FLT3. The kinase inhibition ultimately leads to inhibition of proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Previous studies with other c-KIT inhibitors such as dasatinib showed promising results with respect to survival end points in newly diagnosed CBF AML patients. Midostaurin is considered a more potent c-KIT inhibitor than dasatinib and may be able to potentiate the inhibitory effect on leukemic cell growth.\n\nAnother important therapeutical target in CBF AML is the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (CD33) which is expressed on the majority of AML blasts. Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (GO) is a therapeutic CD33 antibody linked to a strong cytostatic drug (calicheamicin) which causes apoptosis of cancer cells upon internalization. For the combination of GO and standard intensive chemotherapy, metaanalyses of randomized trials have shown that i) a low-dose fractionated administration results in the best tolerability, and ii) among AML subgroups, patients with CBF AML have the greatest benefit from GO in addition to standard therapy. Subgroup analyses within the ALFA-0701 (A Randomized Study of Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin With Daunorubicine and Cytarabine in Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia Aged of 50-70 Years Old) trial population showing beneficial effects of GO on overall survival, relapse-free survival and event-free survival in patients positive for FLT3 mutation as compared to those negative for FLT3 mutation. Subgroup analyses of the GO registration trial ALFA-0701 showed a significant clinical benefit of the patients displaying a mutation in the FLT3 gene compared to those without this mutation. In Addition, CBF AML patients with FLT3 mutations expressed particularly high levels of CD33 antigen and that CD33 antigen levels were positively correlated to the improved survival after GO treatment. Furthermore, recently published data of two paediatric populations with internal tandem mutation in the FLT3 gene showed reduced relapse rates in GO recipients compared to the control group only receiving standard chemotherapy. These results suggest that GO is a particularly beneficiary agent in FLT3 mutated patients who would currently receive midostaurin in addition to intensive chemotherapy as a standard of care. Hence, from a clinical point of view there is an unambiguous rationale supporting the combination of midostaurin and GO for treatment of AML in the two cytogenetic subgroups: CBF AML and FLT3 mutated AML.\n\nGO has become the new treatment standard for patients with CBF AML. The hypothesized positive effect of midostaurin is likely but randomized proof is laking.\n\nMidostaurin has become the new treatment standard for AML patients with mutations in the FLT3 gene. The positive effect of GO is shown in a post-hoc subgroup analysis of the ALFA-0701 trial, but prospective randomized proof is lacking.\n\nTherefore, the proposed trial intends i) to explore and establish the safe combination of GO plus midostaurin (MODULE) and ii) to evaluate the effect of midostaurin versus no midostaurin added to standard AML chemotherapy plus GO in CBF AML (MAGNOLIA) and iii) to evaluate the effect of GO versus no GO added to standard AML chemotherapy plus midostaurin in FLT3 mutated AML (MAGMA).",

Follow-up time will be until progression or death or until a different oncolytic treatment has started (in case no progressive disease during previous fulvestrant and alpelisib treatment has been documented).\n\nShould participants discontinue due to reasons other than progression or death (e.g. toxicity), then they should still be evaluated for disease progression every 8 weeks as per protocol until progression, unless they do not wish to proceed with these screenings, or receive a different oncolytic treatment.",

    "detailed_description": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US as well as in Chicago. Risk factors for CVD include hypertension, diabetes, and lifestyle factors such as smoking, diet, and obesity. Among the critical social and structural determinants of cardiovascular health are food access, neighborhood safety, education, poverty, and chronic stress. Chicago and its surrounding region suffer from longstanding racial disparities in both social conditions and chronic disease burden, contributing to stark racial gaps in cardiometabolic disease mortality. Life expectancy is as high as 84 years on Chicago's North Side, but only 68 years on the West Side - a gap of 16 years.\n\nRush has collaborated with Novartis to \"close the gap\" in CVD inequities on Chicago's West Side by concentrating a critical mass of resources on community-centric approaches to wellness, prevention and management. Engage, Empower, Evaluate (E3) has been built on the foundation of Rush's mission to ensure that all patients and individuals at risk of developing CVD on Chicago's West Side receive the care they need, regardless of race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, or neighborhood, with the ultimate goal to reduce the CVD life expectancy gap for West Side residents by 50% by 2030. To do so, the study team coordinated clinical and community programming into a seamless health-promoting environment, tailored to the specific needs of the population, through remote monitoring and a multidisciplinary team composed of a nurse, social worker, and pharmacist.\n\nThe study team now proposes a trial of the E3 intervention, a remote hypertension monitoring, social care, medication adherence and behavioral lifestyle intervention to improve hypertension control among African American and Latinx patients attending primary care clinics at Rush University Medical Group locations with the eventual aim of closing the racial/ethnic disparity in hypertension control. The proposed feasibility trial will use a randomized-control, four-pronged approach to improve hypertension control. The intervention group will receive the following: 1) remote blood pressure monitoring, 2) a multidisciplinary team composed of nurse, pharmacist and social worker to address medical and social needs, 3) medication titration and adherence support, and 4) a culturally tailored hypertension self-management and diet education mobile phone application. The control group will receive an enhanced version of standard of care for hypertension through a home blood pressure cuff, and dietary and lifestyle educational materials tailored to hypertension self-management sent at timed intervals. The study team hypothesizes that the E3 Hypertension program participants will achieve a greater decrease in systolic blood pressure, and a greater percentage will have reduction of blood pressure below stage 2 hypertension (\\<140/90) in comparison to the control group receiving enhanced standard of care for hypertension.",

The LuDO-N Trial builds on the experience from the previous LuDO Trial and utilises an intensified dosing schedule to deliver 2 doses over a 2-week period, in order to achieve a maximal effect on the often rapidly progressing disease. This strategy requires a readiness for autologous stem cell transplantation in all patients, but is not anticipated to increase the risk of long-term sequelae, since the cumulative radiation dose remains unchanged. The primary aim of the study is to assess the response to 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment at 1 and 4 months after ende of treatment. Secondary aims are to assess survival and treatment-related toxicity. Additional aim are to correlate tumour dosimetry with response, correlate SSTR-2 expression with 68Ga-DOTATATE uptake and to correlate the uptake with the treatment response.",

    "detailed_description": "In SCCA (squamous cell carcinoma of anus) about 15% of patients are diagnosed in metastatic stage, and around 25-40% of patients will experience disease progression after curative intent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for localized disease. In patients with non-resectable local recurrences or with distant metastases, the systemic chemotherapy is the standard approach. Recently, taxane-based combination chemotherapy regimens have demonstrated high efficacy or better tolerance than non-taxane based regimens, and became standards based in prospective trials. First, the modified DCF (docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil) showed a high efficacy in Epitopes-HPV02 trial conducted by investigators including 66 patients and became the first validated chemotherapy regimen in advanced SCCA. Then, the pooled analysis of 115 patients confirmed the mDCF regimen as the standard treatment in all fit patients with advanced SCCA.\n\nThe combination of different chemotherapy regimens and an anti-PD1/PD-L1 (Programmed cell Death-1/Programmed cell Death-Ligand1) were feasible with improved survival in first-line advanced small-cell and non-small-cell lung cancers. In anal carcinoma, Epitopes-HPV02 trial showed that mDCF regimen was feasible with 53% of grade 3-4 adverse-event, with no grade 4 non-hematological toxicity and no febrile neutropenia. And also considering its property to enhance the anti-tumor immune response, mDCF was recommended as an interesting candidate to be evaluated as a backbone chemotherapy for immunotherapy combinations in SCCA.\n\nIn anal carcinoma, investigators are currently conducting a randomized prospective trial promoted by GERCOR (cooperator group) evaluating the association of mDCF and an anti-PD-L1 in metastatic setting. All patients (100) were already enrolled, and no particular safety alert signal was observed at the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)..\n\nAmong different factors that confers a primary resistance to immunotherapy, the lack of antigenic proteins capable to induce immune response, and the downregulation of major histocompatibility complex class 1 (MHC-1) are probably the most important. In fact, the next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques has demonstrated the correlation between tumor mutation burden (TMB) and response to CKI (checkpoint Inhibitor). Hence, most of \"hot\" tumors with high TMB could be treated with CKI alone, while \"cold\" tumors probably need combination strategies. Besides, primary or secondary resistances to CKI caused by downregulation of MHC-1 are well described.\n\nRadiation causes random point mutations and double-stranded breaks in the DNA and modulates the peptide repertoire, increasing tumour-related antigens and TMB to enhance anti-tumour immunity. Radiotherapy has also demonstrated to enhances MHC class I expression.\n\nInvestigators decided to associate radiotherapy, PD-1 (Programmed cell Death-1) inhibitor and mDCF (docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy regimen to improve the efficacy with higher rate of long-lasting progression-free survivors and complete remissions. In addition, the associated extensive ancillary biomarker studies in tissues and peripheral blood will provide a unique opportunity to find out the potential synergic effect mechanism between mDCF, CKI and radiotherapy, as well as to improve our knowledge about underlying resistances.",

    "detailed_description": "The new drug options for advanced melanoma include oncogene-targeted therapy (such as dabrafenib, trametinib and vemurafenib) and immune checkpoint blockade (such as pembrolizumab, nivolumab and ipilimumab). These drugs have shown remarkable efficacy and have regulatory approval for metastatic disease. However, most patients with advanced disease eventually progress. It is unknown if earlier treatment with systemic therapy after surgery improves long term survival or what is the optimal sequencing or combination of therapy. An efficient method of assessing drugs and combinations in humans is critical, particularly as combinations of molecularly targeted and/or immune therapies may have similar signals for efficacy in pre-clinical models, and recapitulation of the human immune system in animal models is limited.\n\nNeoadjuvant clinical trials in patients with resectable but bulky stage III/IV melanoma allows for the rapid evaluation of drug activity in humans utilising multiple clinical endpoints (metabolic response with Positron Emission Tomography \\[PET\\], clinical response with Computed Tomography \\[CT\\] imaging, pathological response, relapse-free survival and overall survival) and translational endpoints (morphological, genetic and immunophenotyping of tumour and blood).\n\nSurgery remains the standard of care for resectable Stage III or IV melanoma, despite the recent drug therapy advances described above. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently expanded the approved use of ipilimumab to include a new use as adjuvant therapy for patients with resectable stage III / IV melanoma, to lower the risk of relapse following surgery. Neoadjuvant therapy in this group of patients may also result in improved survival rates and in the duration of local and distant disease control, with reduced surgical morbidity and the potential for early elimination of microscopic metastatic disease.\n\nThere is an emerging and rapidly growing evidence base of the value of combining targeted and immunotherapies in a number of histological subtypes of cancers. The support for a potential synergy between the two treatment modalities has been established, as has the increased toxicity profile. Both single agent BRAF inhibitors and combined BRAF and MEK inhibitors induce a marked clonal T cell infiltrate in responding melanoma metastases early during treatment (day 7-15), which is transient, and is not present at progression. Concurrently, melanoma tumour antigen and the programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1) expression increase early during treatment.\n\nIt is unknown whether there is potential for converting a subset of patients who fail either immunotherapy or targeted therapy alone into long-term responders by treating with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors in conjunction with mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) targeted therapies. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the PD-1 inhibitor would be best combined sequentially or concurrently with MAPK inhibitors. Mouse models have provided a clear rational for combining these treatments upfront, however there is no human tissue evidence to guide best combination strategies.\n\nThe question of how best to maximize clinical outcome via concurrent versus sequential targeted and immune therapy may be explored efficiently in the human neoadjuvant setting, with detailed interrogation of multiple biopsies early during treatment. Immunological, proteomic and genetic features in tissue and blood provide an in vivo assessment of tumour responsiveness to therapy. This may enable more selective application of therapeutic agents to patients who are more likely to benefit. Such findings would improve the therapeutic index and cost effectiveness of these agents. Earlier systemic therapy prior to surgery also means earlier targeting of distant micrometastases that could become the source of future disease relapse.\n\nThe rationale for this study design is therefore based on the hypothesis that one week of targeted therapy may be sufficient to induce an enhanced tumoral immunity to result in a higher pathological and clinical response using the 'Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors' (RECIST) guidelines when followed sequentially with pembrolizumab, than either pembrolizumab alone or the combination of targeted therapy and pembrolizumab upfront.\n\nThe potential for toxicities that could affect adherence to the combined study treatments are recognised, as additive, overlapping or unforeseen adverse events may occur with the triple combination. The adverse event profiles and safety-related interruption to treatment will therefore be assessed in conjunction with the objective responses.\n\nThe clinical and translational findings from this study have the potential to inform rational decisions regarding combinations of treatment both in the metastatic and the adjuvant settings. This is a critical study to inform future practice and future phase 3 clinical trials. The translational research performed on tissue biopsies and blood will provide mechanistic information to guide the selection of optimal combinations of therapies for phase 3 studies in the advanced and the adjuvant setting.\n\nThis is a phase II, randomised, open label, three arm, parallel group, clinical trial of neoadjuvant combined targeted and immune therapy for patients with BRAF V600 mutant resectable stage III (bulky regional stage IIIB-D, but excluding in transit disease) melanoma.\n\nThis translational study explores pathological and RECIST response rates for a 6-week duration of neoadjuvant therapy across 3 treatment arms. The key secondary outcomes to be measured include a detailed analysis of immunologic, proteomic and genetic biomarkers in tumour tissue and peripheral blood at weeks 1, 2 and 6 compared to baseline and correlated with clinical, metabolic and pathological response to neoadjuvant treatment, and relapse and overall survival to adjuvant treatment. In patients who relapse within 40 weeks of adjuvant treatment, further analysis of tumour tissue (if possible) will be undertaken. Relapse free and overall survival, surgical outcomes and adverse event profile will also be determined.\n\nSixty patients will be randomised to one of three treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio, with 20 patients in each treatment arm:\n\n* \"Sequential immunotherapy\": Dabrafenib 150mg orally twice a day + Trametinib 2mg orally once a day for 1 week, then followed by treatment with Pembrolizumab 2mg/kg delivered intravenously at weeks 1, 3, and 6, then once every 3 weeks from week 6 for 50 weeks.\n* \"Concurrent immunotherapy\": Dabrafenib 150mg orally twice a day + Trametinib 2mg orally once a day + Pembrolizumab 200mg intravenously once every 3 weeks for 6 weeks then Pembrlizuamb alone for a further 46 weeks after surgery.\n* \"Immunotherapy alone\": Pembrolizumab 200mg intravenously once every 3 weeks alone for 52 weeks.\n\nAllocation of treatment will be concealed prior to randomisation which will be performed via a web based system in permuted blocks and stratified by BRAF V600E mutation versus non BRAF V600E mutation (i.e. V600D, V600K, V600R, V600M).\n\nNeoadjuvant treatment for all three arms will be administered for 6 weeks, followed by complete resection of tumour to no evidence of disease. Surgery is followed by 46 weeks of pembrolizumab adjuvant therapy or until disease relapse, death, intolerable adverse drug reactions or by withdrawal of patient consent. After 52 weeks of the study treatment phase, patients will be followed 3 monthly for relapse (and progression, following relapse) and survival for 5 years.\n\nThe biomarker component of this study will require blood samples and core biopsies of tumour tissue at the following time points:\n\n* Baseline (PRE)\n* Week 1 (EDT 1)\n* Week 2 (EDT 2)\n* Week 6 - complete lymph node dissection specimen (POST)\n* At Relapse (RELAPSE) if applicable and available\n\nSurveillance of disease during the 6 week neoadjuvant period will be undertaken with surgical assessments and with ultrasounds of the affected lymph node basin.",

    "detailed_description": "Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (PDAC) remains a major therapeutic challenge due to its innate and acquired chemoresistance. Three major contributors to therapeutic resistance that have been difficult to overcome in PDAC are mutations in the KRAS oncogene, the presence of a dense desmoplastic stroma that acts as a barrier to drug delivery and effector immune cell infiltration, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that renders the tumor innately resistant to immunotherapy.\n\nThe Merchant and Datta labs at the University of Miami (UM) has extensively studied the targeting of downstream effectors of oncogenic RAS. They have shown that mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibition (MEKi) results in reciprocal activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, which confers therapeutic resistance and continued PDAC cell growth. Combined inhibition of Janus kinases (JAK)/STAT3 (STAT3i) and MEKi overcomes therapeutic resistance following RAS inhibition that is mediated through parallel feedback loop activation.\n\nThey have also identified a novel mechanism showing that combined MEKi and STAT3i also inhibits tumor fibrosis and enhances CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) infiltration to the tumor while downregulating immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the TME, resulting in reduced tumor burden and improved survival in genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC.\n\nFurthermore, they have shown that the anti-tumor effects of MEKi and STAT3i are T-cell dependent. This change in the TME, however, is accompanied by sustained PD-L1/PD-1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) expression. The preliminary results further demonstrate that combined MEKi and STAT3i with PD-1 inhibition can harness the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors for an enhanced anti-tumor response.\n\nBased on many years of preclinical investigation, this triplet combination appears to be a promising option and this clinical trial will tests its safety and effectiveness in patients with metastatic PDAC.",

There has been recent success with maintenance therapy in ovarian cancer with both PARP inhibitors and bevacizumab approved in the up-front maintenance setting and in the recurrent, platinum sensitive maintenance setting. However, it is unclear what treatment should be used post-PARPi or bevacizumab maintenance. Additionally, the benefit derived from bevacizumab maintenance therapy is modest with generally a few month improvement in progression free survival. Further, there is emerging evidence that after progression on a PARPi, there is decreased response to platinum-based therapy. This provides a critical unmet need to enhance platinum response, particularly after previous maintenance therapy. This also provides a large group of patients who could potentially benefit from EZH2 targeting agents to block stromal-mediated chemotherapy resistance and metastasis.\n\nThis study aims to investigate whether CPI-0209 will enhance ovarian cancer sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy and prolong the disease free interval after completion of chemotherapy by blocking stromal mediated chemotherapy resistance, metastasis promotion and ovarian cancer growth.",

Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether trastuzumab or lapatinib ditosylate is more effective in treating women with early breast cancer.\n\nUpdate June 2013:\n\nSince the initial development of EPHOS-B in 2007 more evidence in relation to safety and efficacy of anti-HER2 therapies are now available, and in particular, a growing body of evidence that combinations of two anti-HER2 therapies are more effective than monotherapies. Therefore this study has been amended (PART 2) to a 1:1:2 ratio to control, perioperative trastuzumab or the combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying trastuzumab to see how well it works compared with lapatinib ditosylate (and in since June 2013 - compared with a combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab) in treating women with early breast cancer.",

This study is a randomized, open-label trial evaluating subcutaneous inclisiran plus standard of care for LDL-C lowering in high-risk primary prevention patients with multiple comorbidities (e.g., Type II diabetes, liver disease, chronic kidney disease, autoimmune disease, solid-organ transplant) who are taking five or more medications in which drug-drug interactions prevent optimization of statin therapy.",
    "detailed_description": "This is an investigator-initiated, single-site, open-label, randomized trial. The investigators will enroll up to 100 high-risk primary prevention patients with at least one comorbidity and an indication for additional lipid control (such as Type II diabetes with A1c \u2264 8.5%, subclinical atherosclerosis, or ASCVD risk of 7.5% or greater). Patients will be randomized 1:1 to the inclisiran arm (n \u2265 50) with standard of care or standard of care alone (n \u2265 50).\n\nThe study will consist of five study visits (screening, baseline, 3 months, 9 months, and 12 months). Patients in the inclisiran arm will receive a subcutaneous injection of inclisiran 284 mg for three doses (baseline, 3 months, and 9 months following randomization) as add-on therapy. LDL-C (the primary endpoint) along with other biomarkers will be measured at screening, baseline (inclisiran dose #1), 3 months (inclisiran dose #2), 9 months (inclisiran dose #3), and 12 months (labs only). Patients will also undergo medical history and medication review at each visit. Surveys will be completed at each visit during the study period.\n\nPatients in the control arm (standard of care) will continue with their current lipid-lowering therapy. No adjustments will be made to lipid-lowering therapy during the course of the study. Participants will be aware of the group to which they have been randomized.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine the efficacy of inclisiran for LDL-C lowering in high-risk primary prevention patients with multiple comorbidities (e.g., Type II diabetes, autoimmune disease, liver disease, chronic kidney disease, solid-organ transplant) who are taking five or more medications in which drug-drug interactions prevent optimization of statin therapy.",

The prognosis for metastatic or locally advanced metaplastic breast cancer (MpBC), a rare and highly chemotherapy-resistant subtype of TNBC, is even worse than for non-metaplastic TNBC, with a median overall survival ranging from 3 to 8 months.1 Standard systemic chemotherapy remains the only available treatment option for patients with metastatic or locally advanced MpBC, even though this disease is largely refractory to cytotoxic drugs. Therefore, combination strategies to understand and overcome mechanisms of resistance to improve marginal chemotherapeutic efficacy are needed to improve the prognosis of these patients. We have found that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is a critical target for overcoming chemotherapy resistance in TNBC.2,3 iNOS expression is increased and associated with poor prognosis in invasive TNBC and MpBC.2-5 It has been shown that nitric oxide (NO) through iNOS induces many of the major oncogenic pathways such as RAS/ERK, HIF1\u03b1, NF- \u03baB, and others making this a unique oncogenic driver. One of the major oncogenic pathways activated by iNOS/NO is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway.6-9 Alterations in the Pl3K/Akt pathway have also been linked with chemotherapy resistance, especially in MpBC.10-14 We hypothesize that addition of the PI3K inhibitor, alpelisib, to a pan-NOS inhibitor (L-NMMA) and nab-paclitaxel will increase objective response rate (ORR) in patients with HER2 negative metastatic or locally advanced MpBC. Both first- and second-line patients will be eligible for this trial. Patients may have received prior immunotherapy, per standard of care.",

The Core part is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled study which is comprised of the following three periods: Screening / washout period, Single-blind active run-in period, Double-blind treatment period (8 weeks). A 52 week, open-label extension part will be conducted following the completion of the Core part. Those participants that complete the Core part without permanent study drug discontinuation will be offered continued participation in an additional 1 year safety extension to the protocol. Of the patients completed the Core part, approximately 278 participants who are eligible and agree to participate and sign a new informed consent form will start the OLE part, and receive the open-label LCZ/AML combination drug through the OLE part. At start of the OLE part, all participants will be switched to the open-label LCZ/AML 200 mg/5 mg combination drug from double-blinded study medication. After 4 weeks of OLE part, the dosage will be titrated up to LCZ/AML 200 mg/10 mg if an adequate control in blood pressure is not achieved \\[msSBP \u2265 130 mmHg or msDBP \u2265 80 mmHg, or the Investigator's judgement basically in accordance with the current local hypertension treatment guideline (JSH2019)\\] and when there is no safety concern on up-titration judged by the Investigator. If the blood pressure is controlled optimally, the participants will continue to receive LCZ/AML 200 mg/5 mg. Down-titration from LCZ/AML 200 mg/5 mg to LCZ/AML 200 mg/2.5 mg is permitted after the start of OLE part if participants are having difficulty with the current treatment of LCZ/AML 200 mg/5 mg due to adverse events (AEs) etc. Dose adjustment (up or down-titration) is allowed if participants meet the criteria for dose adjustment (the same defined above as up-titration and down-titration). The Investigators should maintain the maximum tolerated dose as much as possible after 8 weeks of OLE part. Thiazide diuretics/thiazide-like diuretics are allowed as rescue medication(s) at the investigator's discretion on and after 8 weeks of OLE part, if blood pressure is not adequately controlled even with LCZ/AML 200 mg/10 mg or maximum tolerated dose and with no signs of hypovolemia.

The study will also characterize the risk of QT prolongation of AAA617 in this participant population.",
    "detailed_description": "This open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, single arm phase II study in mCRPC participants aims to better characterize the safety and tolerability of AAA617 in participants with moderate and severe renal impairment compared with normal renal function. Since both severe and moderate renal impairment have very low incidence within mCRPC participant population compared to participants with normal renal function, the enrollment will occur in parallel for the 3 cohorts; participants will be stratified in one of the three cohorts (A:normal, B: moderate or C: severe) based on their eGFR at screening.\n\nAll participants will undergo a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan at screening to confirm PSMA positivity.\n\nParticipants will receive a dose of 7.4 GBq (\u00b110%) of AAA617 once every 6 weeks for a planned 6 cycles for cohorts A and B and for 3 cycles (and 3 additional cycles) for cohort C.\n\nAfter treatment period, participants will be asked to join a long term follow up (LTFU) study to monitor their safety up to 10 years after the 1st dose of AAA617. In case of the LTFU study is not available at the time of end of treatment period (safety follow-up visit), participants will continue in Long Term Follow-up period in this study for up to one year until they can roll over into the separate LTFU study.\n\nThe primary outcome will be to determine the effect of radiation absorption in kidney and other organs at risk as well as the concentration in blood and radioactivity in urine in PSMA- positive mCRPC participants with moderate and severe renal impairment. In addition, the study will assess the relationship between drug concentrations and QTcF.\n\n20 participants with 6 countries are expected to be included with at least 6 evaluable participantts per cohort.",

OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause.\n\nTreatment duration: approximately 43 months.\n\nScreening period At screening, the participants will be assessed for eligibility and will undergo a 68Ga-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan to evaluate PSMA positivity.

PSA progression is strongly discouraged as a criterion for initiation of a new neoplastic therapy prior to BICR-determined progression. PCWG3 guidelines should be followed to guide discontinuation of treatment.\n\nEnd of Treatment visit must be performed \u2264 7 days after the last day of study treatment period. EOT is to occur before the participant is to enter the post-treatment Follow-up period of the study and before the initiation of any subsequent anticancer treatment, outside of what is allowed in the study.\n\nIf a participant withdraws consent for the treatment period of the study, an EOT must be done and the participant will enter the Post-treatment Follow-up unless he specifically withdraws post-treatment Follow-up.\n\nCrossover period Upon confirmation of rPFS by BICR, participants randomized to the ARDT arm will either be allowed to crossover to receive 177Lu-PSMA-617 within 28 days of central confirmation of radiographic progression or may continue to receive any other therapy per the discretion of the treating physician in the Post-treatment Follow-up.\n\nIn order for a participant randomized to the change in ARDT arm to cross over to receive 177Lu-PSMA-617, he must meet the following criteria:\n\n* Confirmed radiographical progression as assessed by BICR\n* No intervening antineoplastic therapy is administered after the randomized treatment\n* Any unresolved toxicity from prior therapy should be controlled and must be no greater than CTCAE grade 2 or baseline at the time of registration for crossover.\n* ECOG performance status 0-1 at the time of registration for crossover\n* Adequate organ function at the time of registration for crossover:\n* Agreement to continue with the study visit schedule\n\nA participant, who is deemed to have disease progression per investigator assessment, but not by BICR, is not eligible to crossover at that time. Such participant should continue to receive randomized study treatment until progression determined by BICR.\n\nIf crossover to 177Lu-PSMA-617 is selected, then 177Lu-PSMA-617 will be administered with the same dose/schedule as for participants who were initially randomized to receive 177Lu-PSMA-617.\n\nAfter the last day of study treatment period of 177Lu-PSMA-617 or upon second radiographic progression (rPFS2), the participants must have a second End of Treatment (EOT2) and enter the Post-treatment Follow-up. The participant can receive any other therapy per the discretion of the treating physician in the Post-treatment Follow-up.\n\nPost-treatment Follow-up period\n\n* 30 day Safety Follow-up All randomized and/or treated participants should have a safety follow-up conducted approximately 30 days after the EOT visit.\n* Long term follow-up Long term follow-up starts after the 30 Days Safety follow-up and lasts until the accrual of events for the planned OS-based analysis (key secondary endpoint).\n\nIn long term follow-up safety and efficacy information will be collected:\n\n* Safety: all medically significant adverse events (all SAEs) deemed to be related to 177Lu-PSMA-617. This will include potential late onset radiation toxicity. For participants who received 177Lu-PSMA-617 in the 177Lu-PSMA-617 arm or in crossover, the following adverse events will be captured beyond the 30 day safety period regardless of relationship to study treatment and whether new anticancer therapy has been initiated: hematologic toxicities with primary focus on myelosuppression and thrombocytopenia (including need for transfusion or use of growth factors), renal failure, xerostomia, xerophthalmia, secondary malignancies.\n* Efficacy: In any participant entering long term follow-up discontinuing for reasons other than BICR-determined radiographic progression, tumor assessments must be performed every 8 weeks after first dose of study treatment for the first 24 weeks (week 9, 17, 25) and then every 12 weeks (week 37, 49, etc) until confirmation of radiographic progression by BICR\n\nThe long-term follow-up period will also include the collection of survival information and other assessments.\n\nOther: Other data collected during long-term follow-up includes short physical exam, blood sampling for hematology, chemistry testing, coagulation, DNA and tumor samples for biomarkers. The visits will be carried out every 12 weeks (\u00b1 28 days) until death, lost to follow-up, withdrawal of consent or accrual of the number of events required for the planned analyses for OS for the study, whichever occurs first.\n\nThis follow-up will allow to collect information on medically significant long-term toxicities such as long-term radiotoxicity.\n\nDuration of long term follow-up is expected to continue till end of study. Participants who have received 177Lu-PSMA-617 and remain in follow-up on the trial at the sponsor's completion of the study will be asked to join a separate study of long-term safety for a duration of up to 10 years\n\nIf the participant withdraws consent for the collection of blood samples, PROs, and imaging assessments during the long-term follow-up, information on survival and AEs per above will be collected.",

The objective of the study is to evaluate the incidence rates of treatment-related complications, identify sub-clinical abnormalities and risk factors in patients participating in the PASCA post-treatment program.\n\nMETHOD: PASCA is a single-center, interventional cohort study of adult patients who received at least chemotherapy and with a complete remission to a testicular germ cell tumor, primary non-metastatic invasive breast carcinoma, high-grade soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, acute myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin's or aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Four assessment visits will be scheduled at 1 month (T1), 6 months (T2), 24 months (T3) and 60 months (T4) after completion of treatment. During these visits, 22 complications will be screened and follow-up care will be systematically offered to the health professional concerned by the complication in case of a positive result. The screening will contain the following elements: screening self-questionnaires, quality of life questionnaire, 12 biological parameters, a urinalysis evaluating hematuria, proteinuria, and leukocyturia, a spirometry, an electrocardiogram, 5 tests evaluating physical condition, vital signs and the perimetric measurement between both arms.\n\nDISCUSSION: This systematic screening could highlight a number of complications occurring after cancer treatments. Sub-clinical abnormalities and new risk factors could also be identified. This new organization of care could improve the quality of life of adult cancer survivors.",

    "detailed_description": "The study is a clinic-based study with remote patient monitoring that uses a team based intervention composed of community health worker (CHW), nurse (RN), pharmacist, and social worker (SW). Eligible patients are those who are 18 years old and over, African American and/or LatinX with elevated CVD risk starting with stage II hypertension following with a primary care provider in an eligible Rush primary care clinic who have access to a phone or device with call or video capabilities in their home. Eligible patients will be enrolled in the study by their participating Rush clinician via two methods: 1) encountering eligible patients during a clinic visit and enrolling them directly into the program with a community health worker (CHW); 2) generating a list of eligible elevated CVD risk patients and CHWs remotely calling patients to enroll in the program. Patients enrolled in the program will receive the intervention of additional resources for improvement of cardiovascular risk in addition to usual care.\n\nFor patients who are enrolled with a CHW onsite, the patient will proceed directly to a visit with the CHW. During the CHW visit, the patient will be introduced to the program, and will undergo verbal consent for the program. Screening for the social determinants of health (SDOH) (using the clinic questionnaire already in use at all Rush primary care clinics) will be completed if not already completed prior to the clinic visit. If patients screen positive for more than three social determinants of health needs, or if they screen positive for homelessness or violence independently, they will be referred to the program social worker who will proceed with a tailored social work intervention remotely during the 3 month course of the study. Patients will also complete the ARMS (Adherence to Refills and Medications Scale) medication adherence screening questionnaire, and receive a cellular enable blood pressure cuff provided from the company HealthSnap. The CHW will provide training on usage of the cuff and enroll the patient in the remote monitoring HealthSnap dashboard. HealthSnap and the remote dashboard are already in use for remote monitoring at Rush for other programs.\n\nPatients will then start daily blood pressures at home which will automatically be transmitted via the cuff's cellular capabilities to the HealthSnap dashboard. They will continue to have weekly CHW virtual visits during the first month of the program that cover education around blood pressure monitoring compliance, medication adherence, social needs and lifestyle modifications via diet and activity for improvement of CVD risk as per the Heart2Heart Manual created by the Heart2Heart study at Rush. Additionally, directly after enrollment, the patient will receive a virtual visit from the program's nurse (RN) in 48 hours to complete a medication reconciliation. The RN will proceed by remotely monitoring the patient blood pressure readings in the HealthSnap portal. Settings have been created to trigger RN notification for action. These settings include a blood pressure greater than 180/110. In this case, the RN will call the patient and triage the patient for symptoms using the standard of care RN triage model in use in Rush's primary care clinics. If necessary, patient's will be scheduled for clinic follow-up or ED follow-up. Patient's who continue to have stage II hypertension without improvement over 14 days but do not tigger the alerts with elevated pressure, will be monitored at least once every 14 days by the RN, and if not improving, will be forwarded to a remote virtual study pharmacist visit for medication titration.\n\nThe study will proceed for a total of 12 weeks, with remote blood pressures recorded for patients daily in the HealthSnap portal. Study goals include improvement of blood pressure to below 130/90 and/or a decrease in systolic blood pressure by 10 mmHg points. If patients reach the goal prior to the end of the study, they will continue with the study until the the completion of the 12-week period, after which they will return to usual care. Patients who do not achieve the goal at the end of the 12-week period will return back to the standard of care model in the primary care clinic. Patients will receive a repeat SDOH screening questionnaire at completion of the study at 12 weeks and on follow-up at a 3-6 month window. A repeat blood pressure will be collected remotely at a 3-6 month window follow-up to assess adherence.\n\nStudy goals include enrollment of 150 patients during each 12-week intervention with rolling enrollment. The study will conclude after a 3 year period.\n\nEach of the E3 team members (the CHW, RN, pharmacist, and SW) will document their interactions with the patient in Epic and REDCap as outreach encounters. The encounters will be structured so that important information, such as SDOH screening, race, ethnicity, sex, marital status, zip code, co-morbidities (obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and smoking), number of medications, insurer, and number of visits can be data-mined from the Epic notes for analysis. Patient information will be stored in a data base managed by the study data manager and analyst with de-identified patient information.\n\nData will be analyzed in a pre-intervention and post-intervention manner. Change in blood pressure will be noted, with special attention paid to corresponding changes in SDOH needs based on screening, number of intervention outreaches, and time spent during outreaches. The converse, a lack of a change in blood pressure will also be compared to SDOH needs documented in CHW and social work intervention outreaches as well as successful intervention outreaches.",

Dose expansion will only be open to patients diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer.",
    "detailed_description": "We hypothesize that ribociclib plus belinostat will be a well-tolerated and demonstrate activity in women with metastatic triple-negative breast or recurrent ovarian cancers.\n\nThis trial combines two targeted agents, a CDK inhibitor and a lysine deacetylase (DAC) inhibitor for use as the first targeted treatment for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. This in itself would be a leap forward for women who currently endure sequential treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapies. However, we will also be using samples from this trial in NIH-funded research on clonal evolution and geographic heterogeneity in breast cancer. Blockade of CDK4/6 and of lysine deacetylases (DAC) are both promising treatments for breast cancer. DAC inhibitors have been shown to have single-agent activity against triple-negative breast cancer in vivo, possibly through decreasing EMT, decreasing migration, and decreasing metastasis \\[6, 7\\] CDK4/6 inhibitor monotherapy causes cell cycle arrest and tumor regression in triple-negative breast cancer models. \\[8, 9\\] However, neither approach has been successfully translated into clinical use as a monotherapy.\n\nThere are several lines of evidence demonstrating that inhibiting DAC increases the sensitivity of breast cancer to CDK4/6 inhibition. Recently, we showed that inhibitors of cell cycle progression, including CDKN1A, CDKN1C, CDKN2B, and CDKN2D, are increased by DAC inhibition in breast cancer cell lines, including triple-negative cell lines. \\[10\\] Others have shown cell cycle arrest by DAC inhibitors due to increases in p21 or decreases in CDK2 and cyclin A. \\[11-13\\] We also see an increase in RB1 expression in breast cancer cell lines. In the TCGA breast cancer analysis, RB1 was frequently down-regulated but not mutated or lost in triple-negative breast cancer. \\[14\\] Therefore, we hypothesized that DAC inhibition would increase the sensitivity of breast cancer to CDK4/6 inhibition. We first tested this hypothesis in a small panel of cell lines. We showed and published that all showed synergy between a CDK4/6 inhibitor (PD-0322991) and DAC inhibitors. \\[10\\] Since then, we have tested the combination of the DAC inhibitor vorinostat and the CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-322991 in a larger panel of cell lines and have shown at least additivity in most triple-negative cell lines. Indeed, it seems that those cancers least sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition may benefit the most from co-treatment with a DAC inhibitor.\n\nRecently, we investigated ribociclib and belinostat in six triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. All 6 cell lines showed growth inhibition with belinostat and panobinostat. Synergy was seen in four of the six cell lines at multiple doses.\n\nWe have also recently completed an analysis on a window of opportunity trial of the DAC inhibitor high-dose valproic acid, in breast cancer.\\[15\\] In that study, women were treated with valproic acid for one week before definitive therapy began. Fifty percent of women with triple-negative breast cancers had a significant decrease in Ki-67 with one week of valproic acid, providing proof of principle biologic activity of DAC inhibition in triple-negative breast cancer. (By contrast, no HER2 positive tumor had a decrease in Ki-67 with valproic acid treatment.) Given the genomic similarities between serous ovarian cancer and triple-negative breast cancer seen in the TCGA and pan-cancer analyses \\[16\\], we have chosen to include ovarian cancers in the dose-escalation component to increase accrual rate but not in the dose-expansion.\n\nNeither CDK4/6 inhibition nor DAC inhibition have a well-defined predictive biomarker to determine which cancers will respond and which will not. Because of the complex genomic effects of inhibition of the 11 DACs and the multiple targets of DACs, including histones, p53, etc, it is unlikely that a single gene or protein alteration will predict sensitivity. We have published a method for predicting sensitivity to targeted drugs using genome-wide gene expression analysis. \\[17\\] After demonstrating proof of principle by accurately predicting sensitivity to vemurafenib, we developed a genomic biomarker for the DAC inhibitor valproic acid. We then validated that this biomarker predicted sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. In the window of opportunity discussed above, our genomic signature had an AUC of 0.66 for predicting decreased Ki-67 with one week of treatment with valproic acid. We will develop a similar multi-gene gene expression based biomarker for the combination of ribociclib and belinostat.",

Prostate cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body (localized) is typically treated through surgery or radiotherapy, which for many men is curable. Despite definitive local therapy, cancer that has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent) disease develops in 27-53% of men. Often this is detected by measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) without visible evidence of metastatic disease. Lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan (177Lu-prostate specific membrane antigen \\[PSMA\\]-617) is a new small molecule PSMA-targeted radioactive therapy that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adult patients with PSMA-positive mCRPC who have been treated with androgen receptor inhibitors and taxane-based chemotherapy. Vorinostat is used to treat various types of cancer that does not get better, gets worse, or comes back during or after treatment with other drugs. Vorinostat is a drug which inhibits the enzyme histone deacetylase and may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving vorinostat and 177Lu-PSMA-617 may kill more tumor cells in in patients with PSMA-low mCRPC.",

    "detailed_description": "This is a multicenter, international, phase II study of post-radiotherapy (RT) combination of ribociclib and everolimus to treat pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients newly diagnosed with HGG and DIPG that harbor alterations of the cell cycle and/or PI3K/mTOR pathways to assess treatment efficacy (Part 2). The study will include a feasibility cohort (Part 1) to identify the dose of ribociclib PfOS (Powder for Oral Suspension) that is safe and tolerable in combination with everolimus. Efficacy for Part 2 study will be defined by progression-free survival (PFS; HGG \\[stratum A\\]) and Overall Survival (OS; DIPG \\[stratum B\\]), with key longitudinal biomarker correlatives. Outcomes among patients with primary thalamic, spinal cord, and/or secondary (radiation related) HGG (strata C) will be descriptively analyzed. Objective radiographic response rates and agent-specific toxicities will also be assessed, with a feasibility cohort to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination of ribociclib and everolimus in patients with metastatic disease who received upfront craniospinal irradiation (stratum D).\n\nProtocol therapy with the maintenance combination of ribociclib and everolimus must begin no later than 35 calendar days post-completion of RT. The earliest patients can begin protocol treatment is 28 calendar days post-completion of RT. Each cycle will be 28 days in duration and treatment can continue up to a total of 26 cycles. Ribociclib will be given orally once daily for 3 weeks (days 1-21), with one week off. Everolimus will be given orally daily continuously (days 1-28).",

In cases where the initial treatment response is inadequate, irreversible tissue damage often persists, making it a fatal complication that significantly reduces quality of life even for long-term survivors.\n\nTherefore, the success of first-line treatment is crucial, but to date, there are no approved drugs specifically for the first-line treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease. Besides corticosteroids, which have been used palliatively for over 50 years, there are no proven effective treatments available.\n\nAgainst this background, this study was designed to explore the potential of new treatments as first-line therapy for chronic graft-versus-host disease, where effective treatment options are currently lacking.\n\nInitially, the objective response rate will be analyzed at the 48-week mark based on the NIH Consensus Criteria (Lee 2015). Additionally, the study will evaluate the proportion of patients with steroid-resistant or steroid-dependent conditions, the objective response rate(ORR), failure-free survival(FFS), duration of response(DOR), and the proportion of patients who have reduced corticosteroids. Furthermore, the differences in treatment effects between the two groups of patients will be analyzed based on safety endpoints, including adverse events, laboratory tests, physical examinations, and vital signs.",

    "brief_summary": "Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is an almost invariable lethal cancer in humans.\n\nMost patients present with a rapid progressive mass in the neck with progressive complaints like dyspnoea, dysphagia or pain. The risk of suffocation is the main reason for rapid surgical intervention, but we know from literature that an oncological resection with clear margins is seldomly achieved. Some patients deteriorate that fast after surgery that radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy is not feasible anymore. Patients with BRAF-mutated ATC already have shown to benefit from targeted BRAF/MEK inhibition. This study aims to increase the number of patients that undergo a successful R0 tumor resection after neo-adjuvant BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment.",
    "detailed_description": "Unmet need ATC is a very serious condition and is, apart from a few exclusive cases, always lethal. Many patients suffer uncontrollable loco-regional disease with even so uncontrollable complaints of airway obstruction, oesophagus obstruction, pain and neck movement impairment. One of the only shown beneficial treatment is complete surgical resection with clear surgical margins combined with radiotherapy and systemic treatment. However, in less than 10-15% of the patients the pathologist reports clear surgical margins. Thereby it is noticeable that surgery often results in serious morbidity, due to an esophagectomy, laryngectomy or trachea resection all accompanied by an extensive reconstruction. All of these come with serious morbidity and seldomly lead to clear margins and better outcome.\n\nProposed solution A single center, phase II study for the evaluation of safety and efficacy of neo-adjuvant and adjuvant dabrafenib/trametinib treatment in BRAF mutated ATC patients. By introducing neo-adjuvant treatment the hypothesis is that better selection is done for patients who are eligible for complete surgery and that surgery results more often in clear surgical margins after neo-adjuvant treatment. Second benefit of treating patients with combined loco-regional and systemic agents before surgery is that micro/macrometastases (being there in at least 30% of the patients at diagnosis) are already being treated directly after diagnosis. Lastly, adjuvant treatment with dabrafenib/trametinib will hopefully result in reduction of local and distant recurrences after surgery.",

    "brief_summary": "Hypothesis\n\nEfficient unloading of oxygen to regions of high metabolic demand requires a healthy microvasculature to sense local oxygen tension and regulate flow, accordingly. In sickle cell disease patients, the investigators have demonstrated oxygen supply-demand mismatch, or SDM, in proportion to anemia severity. SDM occurs in both the peripheral circulation and the brain, and four characteristics: 1) Hyperemia beyond expected for the level of anemia, 2) Corresponding loss of vascular dilatory reserve, 3) Impaired oxygen unloading to the tissues, and 4) Tissue hypoxia. In sickle cell disease, red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) adhere to vascular endothelium triggering transient or irreversible microvascular damage as well as releasing vasoactive substances that contribute to microvascular dysregulation. The investigators postulate that ongoing microvascular damage/dysregulation in the setting of increased total blood flow contributes to SDM. The investigators believe SEG101, by lowering RBC and WBC adhesion to the microvasculature, will improve SDM and tissue oxygenation.\n\nObjectives\n\n* Primary - The investigators will test whether SEG101 improves SDM in patients with sickle cell anemia by measuring the change in tissue oxygenation measured by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).\n* Secondary/Exploratory - The investigators will identify end-organ disease and whether improvement of SDM by SEG101 occurs in patients with sickle cell anemia.",
    "detailed_description": "Objectives Primary Objectives 1. The investigators will test whether SEG101 improves Supply-Demand Matching in patients with sickle cell anemia measured by the change in tissue oxygenation by NIRS.\n\na) This is measured as a percent oxyhemoglobin saturation (%).\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\n1. Secondary measures to assess the change in tissue oxygenation will be\n\n   1. In the somatic peripheral circulation - microcirculatory perfusion at rest and post-ischemia by laser doppler, venous oxygen saturation by venous blood gas and co-oximetry, and vasoconstriction by plethysmography.\n   2. In the cerebral circulation - blood flow by arterial spin labeling, function brain MRI and response to CO2 challenge, sagittal sinus saturation by TRUST and tissue oxygen extraction by asymmetric spin echo.\n   3. In the pulmonary vasculature - Pulmonary circulation - sleep study pulse oximetry for oxygenation and vasoconstriction by plethysmography, tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) with echo markers of diastolic function to balance pulmonary vascular vs. left heart etiology of TRV.\n2. Determine the relationship between SDM biomarkers and hemoglobin level (anemia).\n\n   a) Hemoglobin and hematocrit for interaction between SDM and anemia\n3. The investigators will determine whether low SDM predicts end-organ function in sickle cell anemia as compared to controls. These endpoints will be organ specific associations:\n\n   a) eGFR and urinalysis for kidney, myocardial fibrosis, systolic/diastolic heart function, troponin and NT-pro-BNP\n4. Relationship between markers of cellular adhesion, oxidative stress and inflammation, soluble VCAM and soluble P-selection.\n\n   a) Interaction of SDM with soluble markers of adhesion and inflammation.\n5. The investigators will identify interactions based on age and sex.\n\n   a) Sex and gender related differences will act as covariates for all measures because many cardiovascular metrics have significant sex differences\n6. Clinical Outcome Measures\n\n   1. VOC history and prospective VOC burden.\n   2. Blood pressure and ECG abnormalities/arrhythmias\n\nOverall Design: The study will be performed at a single large sickle cell disease Centers of Excellence, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles in California, in 20 patients with sickle cell disease who will receive SEG101 therapy and 10 sickle cell anemia subjects who will not receive therapy. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are defined in the human subjects section but sickle cell disease patients will be 16 years of age, or older (to be able to cooperate with the MRI examination without anesthesia), and free from hospitalization or emergency room visit for one month prior to the study. Entire cohort will be gender balanced.\n\nThe effects of SEG101 will be assessed in 20 nontransfused SCD subjects. Figure 3 summarizes the study schema. After comprehensive baseline assessment one month prior the time of study initiation, patients will be started on 5mg/kg of body weight to be initiated at week 1 with follow up dosing at week 3 and week 7 then q4weeks until week 23, which will be the last dose given (7 total doses). Safety laboratories will be drawn at each infusion visit. This will not be a randomized control trial. There will be a follow up phone call the day after receiving the medication. Comprehensive blood and vascular testing will be repeated at 3 and 6 months of treatment.\n\nA total of 10 SCD subjects will be recruited from the hematology clinic at CHLA, generating a similar distribution of SS and S\u00df0 hemoglobin. The participants will be studied twice, once at the beginning of the study, time 0, and once at the end of study, after 6 months. The participants will undergo the same cerebral, peripheral and cardiopulmonary testing procedures as the patients undergoing therapy. The participants will also have monthly phone calls to determine clinical outcomes such as crisis frequency, medication use, hospitalizations and other pertinent clinical findings that may arise.\n\nThis is a non-randomized, open label intervention pilot study evaluating the effect of SEG101 on SDM in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). The investigators plan to enroll 20 patients with SCD, who will receive SEG101. The investigators will also enroll 10 SCD subjects who will undergo all testing procedures but will not receive SEG101 treatment. The investigators will assess three vascular beds: 1. Peripheral circulation of the hand/arm (primary), 2. Brain (primary), and 3. Heart (exploratory).\n\nSpecific measures of SDM are summarized in Table 1. While SDM cannot currently be assessed in the heart, the heart represents a critical target for end organ dysfunction (Aim 2) because of its high metabolic demands and predisposition to microvascular damage.\n\nPatient Population\n\nStudy Population - Patients with sickle cell anemia\n\nInterruption or discontinuation of treatment\n\nPatients may voluntarily withdraw from the study or be dropped from it at the discretion of the investigator at any time.\n\nTreatment/Drug Administration\n\nThis is an open label study of SEG101. All patients will have peripheral SDM assessment in the arm/hand prior to and immediately following their initiation of SEG101 therapy. MRI exams will be performed prior to initiation of SEG101 therapy at the initial study visit but will not have immediate post therapy studies. Patients will have two repeat studies at 3-months and 6-months (end of study). The participants will receive SEG101 at 5mg/kg of body weight by intravenous infusion Qmonth and this will constitute \"treatment\".\n\nExpected side effects\n\nPrevious research has demonstrated efficacy of SEG101 intravenous administration at 5mg/kg of body weight to decrease frequency of painful crisis. This is an FDA approved medication for prevention of painful crisis in SCD. In the Phase 2 clinical trial, the most common side effects noted were nausea (18%), arthralgia (18%), headache (17%), extremity pain (17%), back pain (15%), urinary tract infection (14%), musculoskeletal pain (12%), upper respiratory infection (11%), pyrexia (11%), diarrhea (11%), pruritis (8%), vomiting (8%), and chest pain (2%). These were derived from the SUSTAIN Phase 2 clinical trial.\n\nOther medication use, standard of care\n\nStandard of care therapies will not be stopped or changed. The investigators will encourage all practitioners to maintain pre-study medications throughout the study period, however, the investigators will not require it. The primary physician can adjust other medications as the participants determine necessary to their care. The SS patient's hydroxyurea use will be recorded in order to test a physiologic response (changes in brain and peripheral blood flow) and control for hydroxyurea effect. Use or non-use of hydroxyurea is not a contraindication to participating in this study, however, patients will need verbal assent from their primary hematologist to participate. HU therapy will need to be at the clinically tolerated dose for at least 6 months prior to starting the SEG101 therapy. HU therapy will not be adjusted or initiated during the study period and will not be considered a \"treatment\" for study purposes.",

    "detailed_description": "Recent scientific evidence identified an association between polymorphisms within the IL-17A locus and GCA, supporting a role for IL-17A in vasculitis pathophysiology. Analysis of the inflammatory processes in the aortic wall has indicated that inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-17A are involved in GCA pathogenesis. Elevated IL-17A mRNA levels are correlated with IL-6 and IL-23p19 mRNA levels indicating the involvement of the IL-23/Th17 axis in GCA. With its pleiotropic activity on many different cell types, IL-17A may actively contribute to the inflammatory processes in GCA. In addition, animal studies also support a role of IL-17A as a driver of vasculitis, since mice deficient in IRF-4 binding protein, which have increased IL-21 and IL-17A expression, spontaneously develop arthritis-like joint disease and large vessel vasculitis (LVV).\n\nAs secukinumab has already demonstrated a positive benefit/risk profile in the treatment of multiple chronic inflammatory diseases, including PsO, PsA and axSpA, and based on the scientific rationale for targeting the IL-17 pathway in GCA as well as on the basis of the currently ongoing Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept trial the which evaluates the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 300 mg secukinumab compared to placebo, in combination with a 26-week prednisolone taper regimen in adult subjects with GCA (EudraCT number: 2018-002610-12) (Venhoff, et al., 2021), inhibition of IL-17A by secukinumab has a potential therapeutic benefit for GCA patients.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneously (s.c.) administered secukinumab 300 mg in combination with glucocorticoid taper regimen compared to placebo in combination with glucocorticoid taper regimen, in adult patients with new onset of giant cell arteritis (GCA) who are in clinical remission and who are eligible for treatment with glucocorticoid-monotherapy as per current clinical practice and treatment guidelines for the targeted participant population, thereby supporting health technology assessments (HTAs) of secukinumab in Germany.",
