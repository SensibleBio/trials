    "detailed_description": "IPF is a progressive scarring condition of the lung that primarily affects adults aged 60 and above. There is a tremendous need to identify therapies that can stop the progression of fibrosis in IPF. No such drugs exist to date, and preclinical studies suggest that immune checkpoint inhibitors such as atezolizumab may halt the progression of IPF.\n\nAdults between the ages of 50 and 80 years with IPF and meeting further inclusion/exclusion criteria will be eligible for the study. Presently, there are two medications that are considered the standard-of-care for the treatment of IPF. Subjects will be able to continue standard-of-care while taking the study drug.\n\nThe primary research procedures are experimental treatment with atezolizumab over 24 weeks administered at a standard dose and route of administration approved for the treatment of cancer. The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of atezolizumab with or without standard of care therapy in subjects with IPF. The secondary objectives of the study are to determine change in forced vital capacity, qualitative radiographic change in extent of fibrosis, and patient-reported outcomes with atezolizumab in subjects with IPF over 28 weeks.",

Cobimetinib attacks a protein called MEK that has been known to stimulate cells that promote the growth of cancer cells in the body. Calaspargase pegol-mknl is an enzyme that converts the amino acid L-asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonia. Many types of cancer cell rely on the amino acid L-asparagine, and depleting this amino acid with calaspargase pegol-mknl starves cancer cells of this nutrient. Attacking the MEK protein with cobimetinib is thought to further prevent cancer cells from using this amino acid, causing them to die. Giving calaspargase pegol-mknl in combination with cobimetinib may help control the disease in patients with pancreatic cancer.",

A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as molecules that cause the body to make an immune response (antigens). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as mosunetuzumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and prednisone work in different ways to stop the growth of cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving mosunetuzumab with chemotherapy may be safe, tolerable and/or effective in treating patients with untreated, c-Myc rearrangement positive, high grade B cell lymphoma or diffuse large B cell lymphoma.",

Salvage therapy (treatment after standard treatment failed) needs to be improved. Rituximab, gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin combination is a standard therapy for rrDLBCL and polatuzumab vedotin (PV) is a novel antibody-drug conjugate targeting CD79b. PV has shown efficacy in the setting of rrDLBCL and can improve the response rates of standard salvage therapy.\n\nThis study will focus on subjects in the first relapse (one prior regimen) and will include both subjects who are transplant eligible and those who are transplant ineligible.",

Symptoms of MDS include fatigue, shortness of breath, unusual paleness due to anemia (low red blood cell count), easy or unusual bruising, and red spots just beneath the skin caused by bleeding. The purpose of this study is to see how safe and effective venetoclax and azacitidine (AZA) combination are when compared to AZA and a placebo (contains no medicine), in participants with newly diagnosed higher-risk MDS.\n\nVenetoclax is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of MDS. The study consists of two treatment arms - In one arm, participants will receive venetoclax and AZA. In another arm, participants will receive AZA and placebo. Adult participants with newly diagnosed higher-risk MDS will be enrolled. Around 500 participants will be enrolled in approximately 220 sites worldwide.\n\nParticipants in one arm will receive oral doses of venetoclax tablet and intravenous (infusion in the vein) or subcutaneous (given under the skin) AZA solution. Participants in another arm will receive oral doses of placebo tablet and intravenous or subcutaneous AZA solution.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood and bone marrow tests, checking for side effects, and completing questionnaires.",

    "detailed_description": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the intervention is being studied. It also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the combination of atezolizumab, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab for use in humans. The FDA has not approved atezolizumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.\n\n* Atezolizumab is a protein that affects the immune system by blocking the PD-L1 pathway. The PD-L1 pathway controls the body's natural immune response, but for some types of cancer the immune system does not work as it should and is prevented from attacking tumors. Atezolizumab works by blocking the PD-L1 pathway, which may help the immune system identify and catch tumor cells.\n* Pertuzumab and trastuzumab are targeted therapies approved by the FDA to be used alone or in combination with a chemotherapy drug to treat HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer that hasn't been treated with either trastuzumab or chemotherapy yet.\n* Pertuzumab and trastuzumab are called \"targeted therapies\" because they work by attaching themselves to specific receptors on the surface of breast cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors. When these targeted therapies attach to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the cancer cell may be marked for destruction by your immune system. This process allows pertuzumab and trastuzumab to help slow or stop the growth of the breast cancer. Pertuzumab and trastuzumab target different areas of the HER2 cell, so they are believed to work together more effectively.\n\nIn this research study, investigators are looking to see how well the cancer responds to the combination of atezolizumab in combination with pertuzumab and trastuzumab.",

Biological sampling includes blood samples for functional immune profiling and stool samples for microbiome studies. Biomarker-based assessments are to include but not be limited to NfL and B cell levels.\n\nScreening Period:\n\nAfter obtaining informed consent, all screening assessments, and procedures to establish eligibility will be performed. These may be completed during one or more study visits within the 30-day screening window. Biological sampling will include 2 samples obtained prior to initiation of OCR treatment.\n\nOpen-label Treatment Period:\n\nParticipants that meet all eligibility criteria for enrollment will be initiated on OCR using the standard approved administration and will be followed for 24 months under the standard of care clinical efficacy and safety monitoring described below. Biological sampling occurs at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months as well as prior to the 12 and 24 months visits (14 days +/- 7 days of the visit). Participants who discontinue study therapy during the open-label treatment period are asked to return for an early withdrawal visit and a safety follow-up phone call approximately 6 months after their last dose.\n\nBlinded Treatment Period:\n\nAt Month 24, participants will be randomized (2:1) to either: (Arm 1) placebo infusions every 6 months; or (Arm 2) continue with OCR infusions every 6 months. The blinded treatment period will extend to Month 48 or until new disease activity is observed. All participants in the blinded treatment period will be closely monitored clinically and with frequent research MRIs using a standard protocol that assesses for the development of any new inflammatory disease activity observed following randomization. The development of such new inflammatory disease activity will represent the primary study endpoint. It will be defined as one or more of the following: (1) one or more new clinical relapse(s) (see relapse definition) or (2) MRI evidence on frequent (every 3 months) serial scans of new disease activity. The central imaging analysis will identify incident new or enlarging MRI T2 lesions as compared to prevalent brain lesions documented in each participant from time of randomization (Month 24) and thereafter.\n\nFrequent biological sampling will include blood samples collected every 3 months and stool samples collected every 6 months through the 48-month end of study.\n\nUnblinded Follow-up period:\n\nFor participants who discontinue blinded study therapy before Month 48, including those meeting the primary endpoint by manifesting new disease activity following randomization as defined above, blinded treatment allocation will be revealed and discussed, as described in section 3.5.1. Participants may choose to receive OCR or other treatment and are encouraged to continue with study assessments per the schedule of events.

Despite recent improvements in treatment of ovarian cancer with the introduction of PARP inhibitors, response rates to therapy in the platinum resistant setting remain dismal with response rates of only 10-20% reported for single agent cytotoxic therapies. Given the poor prognosis and limited treatment options for these patients, this population is considered appropriate for trials of novel therapeutic candidates.",
    "detailed_description": "While 5-year survival rates for early stage disease are approximately 90%, survival drops to 30% in advanced stage disease. Symptoms preceding diagnosis are often non-specific and vague. Moreover, there is no effective screening test. As a result, over 75% of patients are diagnosed with advanced stage disease, which leads to the high mortality rate. Regardless of BRCA mutation status, patients who develop recurrent disease will all ultimately progress to develop therapy resistant disease and ultimately die. The use of PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy after either a complete or partial response to frontline platinum based therapy has demonstrated a more dramatic improvement in progression free survival, with the largest benefit noted in those patients with a BRCA mutation, followed by those whose tumors are noted to be homologous recombination deficient and lastly a modest benefit for those cancers that are BRCA wild-type and homologous recombination proficient. This trial will employ the combination of vismodegib and atezolizumab as it has been shown that inhibition of hedgehog signaling in the tumor stroma can reverse tumor desmoplasia. The benefit-risk ratio for atezolizumab in combination with vismodegib is expected to be acceptable in this setting.",

    "brief_summary": "Checkpoint inhibitor therapy represents a significant advance in cancer care. The interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 induces immune tolerance, and the inhibition of this interaction is an effective treatment strategy for numerous malignancies.\n\nDespite its demonstrated potential, immunotherapy is not currently thought to be an effective intervention in the treatment of several immunologically \"cold\" tumors such as prostate cancer, biliary tract cancers, soft tissue sarcomas, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors, microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and non-triple negative breast cancer.\n\nVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is thought to play a key role in modulating the anti-tumor immune response. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is secreted by tumors and leads to endothelial cell proliferation, vascular permeability, and vasodilation. This in turn leads to the development of an abnormal vasculature with excessive permeability and poor blood flow, limiting immune surveillance. In addition, VEGF inhibits dendritic cell differentiation, limiting the presentation of tumor antigens to CD4 and CD8 T cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) VEGF-TKIs are currently utilized in the treatment of a variety of malignancies and are widely utilized in combination with checkpoint blockade in the treatment of clear cell kidney cancer.\n\nThrough the inhibition of VEGF, it may be possible to potentiate the effect of immune checkpoint blockade even in tumors which have traditionally been thought to be unresponsive to immunotherapy. This study aims to evaluate the combination of the immune checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab and the VEGF-TKI tivozanib in a variety of tumors which have a low response rate to checkpoint inhibitor therapy alone.",

During this procedure a tube with a small camera is inserted in the anus to inspect your large bowel.\n\nAt Day 28:\n\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.\n* Your performance status will be recorded.\n* You will have an EKG.\n* Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\nWithin 1 week before Day 56, you will have CT scans of the neck, chest, and abdomen to check the status of the disease.\n\nAt Day 56, if you are in Group A or B, you will have surgery to remove the tumor. You will sign a separate consent form that describes this surgery and its risks. If you are in Group C, you will have a core biopsy. During the surgery/biopsy, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will also be collected for biomarker testing.\n\nFollow-Up:\n\nYour follow-up after the surgery/biopsy will depend on which study group you are in.\n\nGroups A and C:\n\nIf you are in Group A, you will stop taking the study drug for about 2-4 weeks after you have surgery. If you are in Group C, you will not stop taking the study drug. Every 4 weeks (after you resume taking the study drug if you are in Group A, and after the biopsy if you are in Group C):\n\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and a skin exam.\n* Your performance status will be recorded.\n* Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.\n* You will be asked about any other drugs you may be taking and about any side effects you may be having.\n* If you are in Group A, these tests will also be performed the day you start taking the study drug again. You will also have an EKG.\n\nAdditionally, every 8 weeks (if you are in Group A or C), you will have CT scans of the neck, chest, and abdomen to check the status of the disease. Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will also be drawn for biomarker testing at the first of these visits.\n\nAbout 1 year after your laryngoscopy and colonoscopy, these procedures will be performed again to check for side effects related to the study drug. If you did not receive a baseline colonoscopy, this procedure will be performed about 1 year after starting vemurafenib. If you continue on study drug for more than a year, you will have a laryngoscopy every 12 months.\n\nAt any time the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a colonoscopy and laryngoscopy.\n\nAbout 1 year after the surgery/biopsy, you will return to clinic to check if the disease has come back. At this visit, you will have a CT scan or ultrasound of the neck, and blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for tests of your thyroid function.\n\nIf after 4 months the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you will only need to have study visits every 8 weeks. You will still have blood (about 1 tablespoon) drawn for routine tests at a local lab and you will be called by the study staff to check on you. Each call will last about 5-10 minutes.\n\nIf you are in Group C, and if during follow-up the study doctor decides that the disease can be operated on, you will be crossed over to Group A or B. You will have surgery and have the follow-up visits described for that study group.\n\nGroup B:\n\nIf you are in Group B, you will have a follow-up visit about 2 weeks after surgery. The following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.\n* Your performance status will be recorded.\n* Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.\n* You will be asked about any other drugs you may be taking and about any side effects you may be having.\n\nYou will have a second follow-up visit about 8 weeks after surgery. You will have a CT scan of the neck to check the status of the disease. You will have the option of continuing to receive vemurafenib if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest. If you do continue on vemurafenib, you will follow the Group A follow-up schedule (above).\n\nAbout 1 year after your laryngoscopy and colonoscopy, these procedures will be performed again to check for side effects related to the study drug. If you did not receive a baseline colonoscopy, this procedure will be performed about 1 year after starting vemurafenib.\n\nAt any time the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a colonoscopy and laryngoscopy.\n\nAbout 1 year after the surgery/biopsy, you will return to clinic to check if the disease has come back. At this visit, you will have a CT scan or ultrasound of the neck, and blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for tests of your thyroid function.\n\nLength of Study:\n\nIf you are in Group A or C, you will continue to take the study drug for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest. If you are in Group B, you will take the study drug for 56 days and will no longer take it after surgery. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\nYour participation on the study will be over when you have completed the follow-up visits.\n\nEnd-of-Study Visit/Call:\n\nAfter you stop taking the study drug, you will have an end-of-study visit or phone call. You will be asked about any other drugs you may be taking and about any side effects you may have had. If you are called, the call will last about 5-10 minutes.\n\nThis is an investigational study. Vemurafenib is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of late-stage melanoma. It is investigational to use this drug to treat thyroid cancer.\n\nUp to 22 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.",

    "detailed_description": "This is a multi-center, open label Phase II study of patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who will be treated with abemaciclib and atezolizumab alone or in combination.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved abemaciclib or atezolizumab alone or in combination for use in prostate cancer. Abemaciclib is an orally administered molecularly targeted chemotherapy drug called a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which acts to block the ability of cancer cells to divide and thus prevents tumors from growing. In the laboratory setting, this drug is effective in prostate cancer models that have become resistant to standard hormonal treatments, and this drug is currently being studied for its effectiveness in prostate cancer in other clinical trials. Atezolizumab is an intravenously administered drug called an immune checkpoint inhibitor, which acts to activate the immune system to kill cancer cells. Atezolizumab is ineffective on its own in most patients with prostate cancer, but is being tested in combination with other drugs for prostate cancer in other clinical trials. Multiple research groups have demonstrated in laboratory model systems that abemaciclib can may make immune checkpoint inhibitors more effective.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nThe study design divides study participants into two separate cohorts. The first cohort is a set of subjects whose tumors are not known to have mutations in the CDK12 gene (the \"biomarker unselected cohort\") - either because tumor tissue never underwent genetic profiling, or because genetic profiling was performed but did not demonstrate a mutation in the CDK12 gene. In this \"biomarker unselected cohort,\" this study will be testing whether abemaciclib alone or in combination with atezolizumab is an effective treatment strategy.\n\nThe second cohort of participants is a set of subjects whose tumors are known to have mutations in the CDK12 gene based on genetic profiling of the tumor that occurred prior to enrollment on this study. Prior studies suggest that cancers with mutations in the CDK12 gene can shrink in response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. This study will be testing in study participants whose tumors are known to have mutations in CDK12 whether atezolizumab alone or in combination with abemaciclib is an effective treatment strategy.\n\nIn addition, the trial is testing the safety of the combination of the two drugs in both cohorts.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment for as long as they do not have serious side effects and their disease does not get worse. Participants will be followed after completion of study treatment for up to 24 months\n\nIt is expected that about 75 people will take part in this research study.\n\nEli Lilly and Company is supporting this research study by providing funding for research and the study drug abemaciclib.

In addition, a Phase I study tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drugs to use for further studies. \"Investigational\" means that the drugs are being studied. Following the phase I study, additional participants will be enrolled to the Phase II component. The phase II component will test the safest doses of alectinib and cobimetinib (as identified in the Phase I component) in a larger group of patients.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved alectinib as a treatment option for this disease.\n\nThe FDA has not approved cobimetinib as a treatment for this specific disease. However, cobimetinib is approved for treatment of melanoma, another type of cancer.\n\nAlectinib is an oral ALK inhibitor made by the pharmaceutical company Genentech. The term ALK inhibitor means that alectinib targets the abnormal ALK protein that is causing your lung cancer cells to grow. Alectinib has been tested in other clinical research studies and results show that the drug may help stop the growth and spread of ALK+ lung cancer cells.\n\nCobimetinib is an oral inhibitor of MEK, a signaling protein that can cause some types of lung cancer to grow. Cobimetinib is also made by Genentech. Laboratory studies suggest that ALK and MEK may work together to help ALK+ lung cancer cells grow. In the laboratory, combination treatment with drugs targeting ALK and MEK prevented lung cancer cells from growing. It is possible that combination treatment with alectinib and cobimetinib will work better than alectinib alone to control the spread of the cancer.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are trying to determine whether the combination of alectinib and cobimetinib is safe and well tolerated. This study will help determine the doses of the drugs that should be used in the Phase II portion of this study. Another purpose of this study is to determine whether adding cobimetinib to alectinib is effective for treating lung cancer that has already stopped responding to alectinib alone. In order to help understand why the cancer may have stopped responding to alectinib and whether treatment with the two drugs effectively blocks growth signals, all participants in this study will have periodic blood collections and undergo multiple biopsies.",

Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied.\n\nTumor cells from patients with Richter's Syndrome are often resistant to chemotherapy. One reason for this may be that a protein called BCL-2 can prevent cancer cells from dying after being exposed to chemotherapy. Venetoclax is an oral drug that specifically targets BCL-2. It has already been shown to be highly effective at killing tumor cells from CLL patients whose cells are resistant to chemotherapy, leading to its FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) approval for these patients. A small number of patients with Richter's Syndrome have been treated with venetoclax as a single drug, and some of these patients had improvement of their cancer with this treatment.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are looking to see whether adding venetoclax to a standard chemotherapy regimen, R-EPOCH or R-CHOP, will help this chemotherapy work better to more effectively kill tumor cells in patients with Richter's Syndrome. Venetoclax is not approved for Richter's Syndrome or for use in combination with chemotherapy, which is why its use in this trial is considered to be investigational.",

While each participant may be allergic to more than two other foods, the primary endpoint/outcome in this study will only be assessed in peanut and two other foods for each participant. The primary objective of the study is to compare the ability to consume foods without dose-limiting symptoms during a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), after treatment with either omalizumab or placebo for omalizumab.",
    "detailed_description": "Food allergy affects about 15 million people in the United States. This includes 6 million children. The current treatment for food allergy is to avoid eating the foods that may cause an allergic reaction and have medications such as epinephrine (adrenaline) in case of a reaction. However, accidental exposures can be extremely difficult to avoid, particularly if you are allergic to multiple foods. The risks of accidental exposures and life-threatening reactions can place a large burden on patients and their families.\n\nInvestigators in this study would like to learn if omalizumab injections alone or in combination with multi-allergen oral immunotherapy (OIT) will help people with multiple food allergies eat foods to which they are allergic. Oral means that you will take the food allergen (peanut and 2 other foods to which you are allergic) by mouth. If you are allergic to more than 3 foods, this study will only provide OIT for peanut and 2 other foods.\n\nThere are 3 stages to the study:\n\nIn Stage 1, investigators would like to learn:\n\n\u2022 If omalizumab stops or decreases allergic reactions to peanut and other common food allergens after taking it for a length of time.\n\nStage 1 will also have an extra part so that 60 participants will receive omalizumab and everyone (the investigators conducting the research and study participants) will know it. This is why it is called the open label extension. This part of the study will assist investigators in learning if receiving omalizumab for a longer time may work better at decreasing allergic reactions.\n\nIn Stage 2, investigators would like to learn:\n\n\u2022 How a short course of omalizumab combined with Multi-allergen OIT compares with a longer course of omalizumab in decreasing allergic reactions.\n\nIn Stage 3, investigators would like to learn:\n\n\u2022 If, after participants stop both treatments, will they be able to eat the peanut and the 2 other foods in the form that is normally eaten.\n\nIn all stages, investigators would like to learn:\n\n* How safe and effective the treatments are and\n* How the OIT affects the immune system.\n\nParticipation will last up to 56 months (4 years and 8 months).",

This improved mechanistic understanding is important to identify novel therapeutic targets in severe asthma, and to support the development of novel therapeutics. The primary endpoint is the corticosteroid-inducible gene expression pattern in healthy airways.\n\nApproximately 30 healthy adult subjects (age 18-65) will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to one of two study groups: i) patients will receive fluticasone propionate 500 mcg b.i.d. via Accuhaler for 4 weeks (n=20), or ii) patients will receive no treatment for 4 weeks (n=10).

    "brief_summary": "This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).\n\nThe names of the study drugs involved in this study are:\n\n* obinutuzumab\n* venetoclax\n* acalabrutinib",
    "detailed_description": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of investigational drugs to learn whether the drugs work in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drugs are being studied.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved \\[1\\] venetoclax- obinutuzumab and \\[2\\] acalabrutinib individually as treatment options for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). However, the combination of all 3 drugs has not yet been approved by the FDA.\n\n* Venetoclax is a targeted therapy drug that works by blocking a protein called Bcl-2 in cancer cells. Bcl-2 helps cancer cells survive and resist the effects of cancer treatments. By blocking Bcl-2, venetoclax may kill cancer cells and/or make them more open to the effects of other cancer treatments.\n* Obinutuzumab is a drug that targets a protein called CD20, which is found on the surface of B cells, the white blood cells that are affected by CLL. When obinutuzumab attaches to CD20, it directly both destroys the B cells and makes them more \"visible\" to the immune system. The immune system then attacks and destroys the cancerous B cells.\n* Acalabrutinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). BTK is a protein inside of the cell that may be over-expressed in malignant B cells. It is involved in the signaling pathway from the B-cell receptor. BTK inhibition caused by taking acalabrutinib results in decreased malignant B-cell growth and survival.\n\nOn this study, participants will receive obinutuzumab and venetoclax. We will monitor for minimal residual disease (MRD) using a test called \"Adaptive ClonoSEQ\" after treatment with obinutuzumab and venetoclax. MRD is a molecular test, which can detect whether there is any evidence of CLL/SLL in the blood or bone marrow. For participants with detectable MRD despite treatment with obinutuzumab and venetoclax, acalabrutinib will be added with the goal of achieving undetectable MRD. Additionally, for participants who have progressive CLL/SLL despite venetoclax and obinutuzumab, acalabrutinib will be added.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment, end of treatment visit, follow-up visits and an off-study visit.\n\n* Participants will receive study treatment for 2 or 3 years.\n* Participants will be followed for 2 years after completion of the study.\n* It is expected that 40 people will take part in this research study\n* Genentech is supporting this research study by providing venetoclax and obinutuzumab.",

Extensive stage disease has historically been treated with chemotherapy alone with consideration of chest (thoracic) radiation therapy for those with response to chemotherapy, as well as consideration of preventative radiation therapy to the head (prophylactic cranial irradiation). Emerging evidence supports the synergistic interactions between immunotherapy and radiation therapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair and may kill tumor cells. Combining TBI and H-RT with atezolizumab and chemotherapy may improve response to treatment.",

The safety of this treatment will also be studied.",
    "detailed_description": "OSI-774 is a drug that helps to block the activity of an enzyme that is believed to play an important role in cell growth. It is hoped that blocking these enzymes will slow tumor growth. Both cisplatin and docetaxel are commonly used chemotherapy drugs. These drugs are designed to target and destroy cancer cells.\n\nBefore the study, you will have a physical exam, blood tests (around 2 teaspoons), and an electrocardiogram (ECG - a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart). You will also have a chest x-ray and a CT scan. If the diagnosis has not yet been confirmed, a biopsy of the tumor may need to be done. Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood or urine pregnancy test.\n\nDuring treatment, you will take OSI-774 by mouth once a day. Once every 3 weeks, you will be given docetaxel and cisplatin. Docetaxel is given by a continuous infusion into a vein over 1 hour. This will be followed by an infusion into a vein of cisplatin over 2 hours. Treatment with docetaxel and cisplatin is given every 3 weeks for 18 weeks. You will continue to take OSI-774 until your disease worsens, until side effects become too severe, or until your doctor thinks it is no longer benefiting you.\n\nIf at any time during the study the disease becomes worse or you experience any intolerable side effects, you will be taken off the study and your doctor will discuss other treatment options with you.\n\nDuring the study, you will have blood drawn (around 2 teaspoons) once a week. These samples will be used for routine lab tests. Every 3 weeks, you will have a physical exam and your vital signs and weight will be measured. You will also be asked about any side effects you may be experiencing. If your doctor feels it is necessary, you may have more frequent check-up visits.\n\nEvery 6 weeks during treatment, you will have blood tests (around 2 teaspoons), and imaging tests. The imaging tests include a chest x-ray and a CT scan of the head and neck area. You may also have CT scans of other areas of the body. These tests are being done to check on the status of the disease.\n\nYou may continue receiving OSI-774 for as long as your cancer responds to study treatment. If you continue to receive OSI-774, every 3 months you will have a physical exam (including measurement of vital signs), routine blood tests (about 2 teaspoons), a performance status test (a test looking at the ability to perform everyday activities), a chest x-ray, and a CT or MRI scan. Your doctor may decide to take you off this study if you experience significant side effects or your medical condition worsens.\n\nThis is an investigational study. OSI-774 is approved by the FDA for treatment of NSCLC in patients who have relapsed. Its use in this study is considered investigational. Docetaxel and cisplatin are FDA approved and commercially available. There will be a total of 50 patients taking part in this study. There will be no cost for OSI-774 or for any tests and procedures performed solely for this research study.",

    "detailed_description": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the intervention is being studied.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved atezolizumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.\n\nAtezolizumab is a protein that affects the immune system by blocking the PD-L1 pathway. The PD-L1 pathway controls the body's natural immune response, but tumors can interrupt this pathway and partially resist or escape the immune system. By blocking the PD-L1 pathway, Atezolizumab may help the immune system identify and catch tumor cells.\n\nStereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a standard procedure used to treat patients with cancer in the brain. SRS uses many precisely focused radiation beams to treat tumors. It is not surgery in the traditional sense because there's no incision. Instead, SRS uses 3-D imaging to target high doses of radiation to the affected area with minimal impact on the surrounding healthy tissue. Like other forms of radiation, SRS works by damaging the DNA of the targeted (tumor) cells. The affected cells then lose the ability to reproduce, which causes tumors to shrink.\n\nWhen given separately, atezolizumab and SRS, work in different ways to help stop cancer cells from growing and spreading. However, it is not known if giving atezolizumab and SRS at the same time will have a better effect than giving each treatment on its own. It is hoped that SRS treatment will damage cancer cells and make them more visible to the immune system.\n\nThe researchers conducting this study are testing to see whether giving SRS with atezolizumab may boost the body's immune response to cancer, and therefore improve upon the effects of either SRS or atezolizumab given alone.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators will measure the length of time that the participant receive this study intervention without the disease getting worse. The investigators will also look at how well the disease responds to atezolizumab and SRS as well as the safety of the combination.",

The investigators hypothesize that tazemetostat with mosunetuzumab has the potential to increase the efficacy of the product without compromising the safety.\n\nTazemetostat is a drug that inhibits EZH2, an enzyme known to drive the development of B-cell lymphomas, and inhibiting it appears to have many effects that slow down lymphoma growth and enhance the immune system's ability to fight it. Tazemetostat is FDA-approved in previously treated follicular lymphoma and currently undergoing study in other lymphomas.\n\nMosunetuzumab is a bispecific antibody therapy that is a therapeutic strategy that uses the immune system to fight lymphoma, called immunotherapy. Bispecific antibodies have two ends: one attaches to T cells in the immune system and the other attaches to lymphoma cells, helping guide our immune system to attack the cancer. Mosunetuzumab has been studied in follicular lymphoma that has previously been treated, with positive results. Mosunetuzumab is approved by the FDA to be given intravenously (directly into a vein) but is not yet approved by the FDA is not yet approved as an injection under the skin, which is how it is given in this study. They have not yet been studied in combination.",

Fifty patients will be enrolled and treated with standard dosing of SC mosunetuzumab, and with oral tazemetostat by mouth twice daily at standard dosing (800 mg twice daily) beginning at the same time as mosunetuzumab initiation. Response assessments by PET/CT will occur post-mosunetuzumab at Cycle 4, Day 1 (+/- 3 days) and again at the end of treatment. If a participant has a complete response (CR) at Cycle 4 and/or cycle 8, then they will receive a total of 8 cycles of mosunetuzumab. If the patient has a partial response or stable disease at Cycle 4 and Cycle 8, then they will receive a total of 12 cycles of mosunetuzumab. All participants will receive 12 cycles of tazemetostat, unless discontinued from treatment early for disease progression or other protocol-defined reasons. Treatment with steroids, tocilizumab, growth factors, tumor lysis prophylaxis, and antibiotics may be used as per standard of care at our institution. Dose modifications are permitted for toxicity. Correlative studies will be performed prior to and following tazemetostat treatment and peripheral blood collections prior to post-mosunetuzumab treatment, which will give additional descriptive data for use in correlative analyses.",

In this study, investigators hypothesize that the combination of cabozantinib (a multi-kinase inhibitor) and atezolizumab will result in better therapeutic value.",
    "detailed_description": "For metastatic/advanced non-small cell (NSCLC) patients who do not have targetable mutations, the combination of chemotherapy with immunotherapy targeting the programmed death-1 and its ligand (PD-1/L1) is now a standard of care. In addition, recent studies also demonstrated that immunotherapy doublet using anti-PD-1 agent nivolumab and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) agent ipilimumab could be another valid option. However, largely due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, the therapeutic response remains suboptimal in NSCLC patients with PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) lower than 1% (aka PD-L1 negative). For example, the objective response rate (ORR) in KEYNOTE-189 was 32.3% using pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, and only 27.3% in Checkmate 227 study using nivolumab and ipilimumab, in the PD-L1 negative population. These observations necessitate the search for novel combinations to benefit our PD-L1 negative NSCLC patients.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab is such an innovative strategy based on the following rationales: 1) cabozantinib is a multi-kinase inhibitor, and some of the targets, for example the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway is notorious to confer immune suppressive tumor microenvironment. In fact, our previous study has demonstrated that anti-VEGF synergizes anti-PD-1 in preclinical model. Consistent with this, cabozantinib has been shown to increase tumor infiltrative cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, reduce immune suppressive T regulatory cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), as well as activate anti-tumor innate immunity in multiple solid tumors; 2) at the animal level, cabozantinib was found synergistic with anti-PD-1 agents to elicit anti-tumor immune response; and 3) more importantly, at the human level, the combination of cabozantinib with atezolizumab was found safe in Cohort 7 of the phase 1b COSMIC-021 study and achieved 27% ORR in previously immunotherapy-treated NSCLC - suggesting a potentially higher efficacy if such combination is to be used in the 1st line setting.\n\nThe investigators therefore propose here the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab to be used as the 1st line treatment for advanced/metastatic NSCLC with negative PD-L1 expression.",

    "brief_summary": "Historically, medulloblastoma treatment has been determined by the amount of leftover disease present after surgery, also known as clinical risk (standard vs. high risk). Recent studies have shown that medulloblastoma is made up of distinct molecular subgroups which respond differently to treatment. This suggests that clinical risk alone is not adequate to identify actual risk of recurrence. In order to address this, we will stratify medulloblastoma treatment in this phase II clinical trial based on both clinical risk (low, standard, intermediate, or high risk) and molecular subtype (WNT, SHH, or Non-WNT Non-SHH). This stratified clinical and molecular treatment approach will be used to evaluate the following:\n\n* To find out if participants with low-risk WNT tumors can be treated with a lower dose of radiation to the brain and spine, and a lower dose of the chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide while still achieving the same survival rate as past St. Jude studies with fewer side effects.\n* To find out if adding targeted chemotherapy after standard chemotherapy will benefit participants with SHH positive tumors.\n* To find out if adding new chemotherapy agents to the standard chemotherapy will improve the outcome for intermediate and high risk Non-WNT Non-SHH tumors.\n* To define the cure rate for standard risk Non-WNT Non-SHH tumors treated with reduced dose cyclophosphamide and compare this to participants from the past St. Jude study.\n\nAll participants on this study will have surgery to remove as much of the primary tumor as safely possible, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The amount of radiation therapy and type of chemotherapy received will be determined by the participant's treatment stratum. Treatment stratum assignment will be based on the tumor's molecular subgroup assignment and clinical risk.\n\nThe participant will be assigned to one of three medulloblastoma subgroups determined by analysis of the tumor tissue for tumor biomarkers:\n\n* WNT (Strata W): positive for WNT biomarkers\n* SHH (Strata S): positive for SHH biomarkers\n* Non-WNT Non-SHH, Failed, or Indeterminate (Strata N): negative for WNT and SHH biomarkers or results are indeterminable\n\nParticipants will then be assigned to a clinical risk group (low, standard, intermediate, or high) based on assessment of:\n\n* How much tumor is left after surgery\n* If the cancer has spread to other sites outside the brain \\[i.e., to the spinal cord or within the fluid surrounding the spinal cord, called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\\]\n* The appearance of the tumor cells under the microscope\n* Whether or not there are chromosomal abnormalities in the tumor, and if present, what type (also called cytogenetics analysis)",

children treated for medulloblastoma.\n* To evaluate the impact of an aerobic training intervention on sleep quality and quantity in children with medulloblastoma.\n* To evaluate the relation between baseline cognitive performance and the variables of sleep quality and quantity, and fatigue in children with medulloblastoma.\n* To estimate change in neurocognitive performance using a comprehensive assessment battery (e.g., measures of intellectual function, academic abilities, attention, memory, processing speed and executive functions) and investigate the relationship of change to relevant demographic factors (e.g., gender, age at treatment, time since treatment and socioeconomic status) and clinical factors (e.g., treatment intensity/risk group, posterior fossa syndrome).\n* To assess the impact of a computer-based working memory intervention, relative to standard of care, on additional performance- and rater-based measures of attention, processing speed and executive functions.\n* To compare the impact of a computer-based working memory intervention in conjunction with an aerobic training intervention, relative to either intervention in isolation, on measures of attention, processing speed and executive functions.\n* To evaluate the maintenance of improvements on measures of attention, working memory, processing speed and executive functions six months following participation in the computer-based working memory intervention program.\n\nOutline: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to molecular subgroup assignment (WNT, SHH, or Non-WNT Non- SHH) and then by clinical risk stratification (extent of resection, M stage, histologic subtype, and cytogenetic features). All patients will be treated with risk-adapted radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients assigned to Stratum W1 will receive reduced dose radiation therapy. Patients assigned to Stratum W2, S1, N1, or N2 will receive standard dose radiation therapy. Patients assigned to Stratum W3, S2, or N3 will receive high dose radiation therapy. Radiation therapy will be followed by 4 cycles of adjuvant conventional chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, cisplatin and vincristine for all patients. Patients assigned to Stratum N2 or N3 (Non-WNT Non-SHH with high risk factors) will receive 3 additional cycles of pemetrexed and gemcitabine chemotherapy intermixed into the conventional adjuvant chemotherapy cycles. Patients with SHH subtype (Stratum S1 or S2) who are skeletally mature will receive 12 months additional maintenance therapy with vismodegib.\n\nPatients may consent to provide tumor tissue, blood, and CSF samples for biological studies. Tumor tissues are analyzed for the activation of the WNT signaling pathway, activation of the SHH signaling pathway, validation of novel patterns of gene expression via immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis; validation of genetic abnormalities via interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH); construction of gene expression profiles via microarray analysis; construction of DNA methylation profiling via microarrays; single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis for DNA copy number aberrations; potential oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes via DNA sequence analysis; expression of a number of cell signal proteins implicated in the biology of medulloblastoma via western blot; expression of additional proteins encoded by genes associated through SNP and gene expression array analysis with clinical disease behavior. Blood samples are analyzed from patients whose tumors contain gene mutations via sequence analysis of constitutional DNA. CSF and blood samples are analyzed for identification of potential tumor markers. Parents may consent to have blood samples analyzed for inheritable gene mutations associated with medulloblastoma.\n\nPatients may also consent to exploratory research that include additional functional MRI imaging to investigate damage to neural connections from therapy; additional psychological testing to identify neurocognitive effects of therapy; additional heart and lung testing to identify treatment effects; additional endocrine studies to identify treatment effect on growth and development.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years.",

    "brief_summary": "This phase IB/II trial tests the safety, side effects and effectiveness of glofitamab plus ibrutinib with obinutuzumab for the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Glofitamab is in a class of medications called bispecific monoclonal antibodies. It works by killing cancer cells. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as molecules that cause the body to make an immune response (antigens). In the body, glofitamab binds to a receptor called CD3 on T-cells (a type of immune cells) and a receptor called CD20 on B-cells, a receptor that is often over-expressed on the surface of cancerous B-cells. When glofitamab binds to CD3 and CD20 receptors, it causes an immune response against the CD20-expressing cancerous B-cells. Ibrutinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of the abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps stop the spread of cancer cells. Obinutuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Glofitamab plus ibrutinib with obinutuzumab may be safe tolerable and/or effective in treating patients with MCL.",

Determine the safety and tolerability of treatment with glofitamab and ibrutinib (GLIB) for previously untreated MCL in patients with high risk or age \u2265 65 yrs. (Phase Ib) I. Determine the efficacy of treatment with GLIB for previously untreated MCL in patients with high risk or age \u2265 65 yrs. (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess the overall acute toxicity and tolerability of treatment with GLIB. II. Assess the preliminary efficacy of treatment with GLIB based on clinical response.\n\nIII. Assess survival in the absence of progressive disease, recurrence of disease, or death due to any cause after treatment with GLIB.\n\nIV. Assess the duration of clinical response and complete response to treatment with GLIB.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate response to treatment evaluated as minimal residual disease (MRD). II. Evaluate the differential impact of treatment on T cell populations in the tumor microenvironment.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 of cycles 1-17. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 17 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive glofitamab intravenously (IV) over 2-4 hours on days 8 and 15 of cycle 2 and then on day 1 of cycles 3-13. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive obinutuzumab IV over 4 hours on cycle 2 day 1 and 2. Additionally, patients undergo echocardiography during screening, bone marrow biopsy on study, and computed tomography (CT) scans, fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatments, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2 years.",

This pilot will test if SCS can show evidence to improve motor deficits in people with type 3 or 4 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The investigators will enroll up to six subjects with Type 3 or 4 SMA aged 16 or older that show quantifiable motor deficits of the legs but are able to stand independently. The investigators will then implant the subjects with percutaneous, bilateral, linear spinal leads near the lumbar spinal cord for a period of up to 29 days. Although these leads are not optimized for motor function but rather for their clinically approved indication of treating pain, the investigators believe they provide a safe technology enabling our team to perform scientific measurement necessary to evaluate potential for effects of SCS in motor paralysis with SMA. After the end of the study, the leads will be explanted.",

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved ibrutinib and obinutuzumab individually for the treatment of patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, your type of cancer. However, the FDA has not approved the combination of these two drugs as a treatment for any disease.\n\nIbrutinib is a type of drug called a kinase inhibitor.

By blocking this, it is possible that the study drug will kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.\n\nObinutuzumab is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody. It is believed to attach to a protein called CD20 on the outside of a Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia cell. By attaching to the cell, the antibody can cause the Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia cell to die.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are assessing the safety of various dosing regimens of ibrutinib and obinutuzumab.

Anti-CD20 therapy may not be required for all patients. The investigators hypothesis is that it may be better to give anti-CD20 therapy (obinutuzumab) only to patients that still have detectable cancer in their blood (minimal residual disease \\[MRD\\]) after being treated with a combination of two oral medications, zanubrutinib (a BTKi ) and venetoclax (a BCL-2i), instead of giving a combination of three drugs to all patients from the start of treatment. This strategy, if effective, will prevent overtreatment with anti-CD20 antibodies; reduce side effects of treatment while potentially increasing MRD negativity rates; and will possibly make the anti-CD20 antibody therapy more effective given the low tumor burden present when utilized. This study will test this hypothesis by treating subjects with 3 cycles of a zanubrutinib monotherapy lead-in, in order to debulk and mitigate tumor lysis risk, followed by 13 cycles of zanubrutinib and venetoclax combination therapy. Subjects who are both peripheral blood and bone marrow MRD negative at the completion of the 13 cycles of combination therapy will stop treatment and enter an observation phase every 3 months. Subjects that are MRD positive will continue combination therapy with zanubrutinib and venetoclax for an additional 6 cycles but also receive 6 cycles of obinutuzumab in order to augment response and increase MRD negative rates for the overall treated cohort.",
    "detailed_description": "This is an open label, phase II, investigator-initiated clinical trial of 50 subjects. Subjects with CLL/SLL who have treatment indications per the 2018 International Workshop for CLL (iwCLL) will be eligible to enroll. The investigators hypothesize that anti-CD20 therapy may not be required for all patients and a response-adapted strategy will prevent over treatment of a significant number of patients and reduce toxicity of treatment while still achieving a high rate of MRD negativity. The investigators also hypothesize that late addition of anti-CD20 therapy can eliminate low burden residual disease in subjects and maximize undetectable MRD negativity in subjects who remain MRD positive.\n\nAll subjects will initiate induction therapy with 3 cycles of zanubrutinib monotherapy in order to debulk subjects and mitigate tumor lysis risk. This lead-in period will then be followed by 12 cycles of zanubrutinib and venetoclax combination. Standard ramp-up protocols for venetoclax based on TLS risk assessed prior to C4D1 will be utilized. All subjects will complete 12 cycles of zanubrutinib and venetoclax combination therapy or 15 cycles of total treatment. Peripheral blood and bone marrow MRD assessments will occur at C16D1. Subjects will continue on combination treatment for an additional 1 month while results of MRD testing are obtained. In total, all subjects will be on treatment for at least 16 full cycles. Subjects that meet definition of MRD negativity will stop therapy at C17D1 and enter an observation phase with study visits every 3 months. Subjects that meet definition of MRD positivity will continue combination therapy with zanubrutinib and venetoclax, but will also receive 6 cycles of obinutuzumab starting at C17D1. In this subgroup, peripheral blood and bone marrow MRD assessments will occur after an additional 6 cycles of the triplet combination therapy (C23D1) at which point all subjects will stop study treatment regardless of MRD status.",

Patients still considered to be at high risk of recurrence (per NCCN guidelines) will receive further adjuvant chemotherapy based on protocol and the discretion of the treating oncologist/investigator.\n\nEFFICACY FOLLOW-UP PHASE ( Week 2 postop and Months 3, 6) Patients will be followed up for an efficacy follow-up phase during first 2 weeks postop and months 3 and 6 and will complete the following assessments:\n\n1. History \\& Physical exam\n2. Vital Signs\n3. Adverse event assessment\\*\n4. Assessment of concomitant medications\n5. Quality of life assessments (satisfaction survey at week 2 and month 3 only)\\*\n6. Vital status update\\*\n7. Assessment of adjuvant therapy\\*\n8. Blood collection for ctDNA analysis and biobanking\\* (ctDNA blood draw only at week 2 visit)\n9. Stool collection \\*\n10. Adjuvant chemotherapy with standard of care chemotherapy (ONLY FOR HIGH-RISK PATIENTS)\n11. Laboratory analysis (CEA,CBC \\& Chemistry panel)(3 \\& 6 months only)\n12. Standard of care imaging (6 months only)\n\nLONG TERM/ SURVIVAL FOLLOW-UP PHASE Patients will be followed up for an long-term (survival) follow-up phase during months 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 and will complete the following assessments:\n\n1. History \\& Physical exam\n2. Vital Signs\n3. Adverse event assessment\\*\n4. Assessment of concomitant medications\n5. Quality of life assessments\\*\n6. Vital status update\\*\n7. Blood collection for biobanking (these samples are optional) \\*\n8. Stool collection \\*\n9. Standard of care imaging\n\nResearch procedures:\n\n1. Blood and stool samples will be collected for ctDNA analysis (mandatory) and for banking (optional) at baseline and throughout different stages of the study for future exploratory analysis. The optional blood samples will be stored at Baylor College of Medicine main campus in the ABBR (Alkek Building for Biomedical Research) laboratory and kept for up to 10 years. The purpose of biobanking these samples is for future exploratory research analyses based on future available funding. Stool sample collection kits will be provided to participating subjects which they will be shipping back to our site and collected at several timepoints for storage and future use. In the future stool samples may be used for metabolomic and proteomic profiling. (Costs of shipping back stool kits will be covered by site/sponsor).\n2. Quality of life (QOL) outcomes will be obtained through patient- reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires (approx. duration: \\~10-20 min per visit) PRO data will be collected through use of the following instruments: MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI), QLQ C30, and a satisfaction survey. All patients will complete the MDASI, QLQ-C30, and questionnaires at the following timepoints: baseline, after neoadjuvant therapy completion, postoperatively on week 2, months 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36. The satisfaction survey will be only collected at week 2 and month 3.\n3. Banking procedures: A proper IRB submission will be submitted for request of historic sample controls to previously biobanked specimens within Baylor's biobanks. Historic samples will be deidentified and will be used for comparison. An attempt will be made to match demographics and tumor site but this comparison is going to be used only as an exploratory endpoint.\n4. Storage of Data: Each patient will have their own research binder in which research data will be collected. Each subject will be assigned a unique study number ID and will be used throughout the patient's participation. No personal data will be used to identify patients, only the study ID will be used for confidentiality purposes. Data will be captured manually in the patient's binder and electronically in Oncore using study ID number only. Subject binder will be stored in a locked cabinet on the 7th floor at the McNair campus. Only authorized personnel will have access to patient's binder. Information from medical chart that will be used includes: demographic data, concomitant medications, vital signs, medical history, laboratory results, imaging results, notes from office visits, surgery notes, operative notes, progress notes, pathology reports. No information will be shared with any third parties.",

    "detailed_description": "Although some combination of anti-VEGF plus PRP is the most common treatment approach for PDR with and without DME, there are currently no long-term data on a standardized approach. Vitrectomy is not currently used as first-line treatment for early PDR but advances in surgical technique have reduced associated complications and the ability to remove the posterior hyaloid during surgery may have advantages over nonsurgical approaches, especially in the reduction of vitreous hemorrhage and/or traction retinal detachment that may occur later when the hyaloid separates naturally. Protocol S demonstrated both PRP and anti-VEGF alone result in good visual acuity results long-term so it is expected that a combination treatment would also result in good visual acuity results.\n\nThis study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of two treatment strategies for PDR: faricimab plus PRP and Vitrectomy with endolaser with the goal to determine whether either approach decreases visit and treatment burden along with decreasing complications compared with the other treatment method while maintaining good visual acuity. The primary objectives of this study are to compare visual acuity at 3 years following vitrectomy with endolaser or faricimab+PRP and to compare number of treatments for PDR (i.e., injections, PRP, vitrectomy) following the end of randomized treatment over 3 years.",

Cobimetinib blocks activation of a protein called Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) that is part of incorrect growth signals in histiocytosis cells. Four different groups of patients will be enrolled.",
    "detailed_description": "Histiocytic disorders are diseases caused by misfunctioning or buildup of particular immune cells called histiocytes. Many histiocytic disorders (LCH, juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG), Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD), and Rosai-Dorfman Disease (RDD)) arises from blood cells that receive incorrect growth signals. These incorrect signals are caused by changes in genes (mutations) that lead to tissue damage (lesions) which causes disease. Some patients with LCH can develop neurodegeneration (LCH-ND) which is damage to neurons that results in reduced brain function, from LCH cells that go to the brain and activate inflammation. LCH arises from blood cells that receive incorrect growth signals. These incorrect signals are caused by mutations (changes in genes). The LCH blood cells can create changes in the structure of almost any organ, and can cause damage to normal organ function.\n\nThe purpose of this research study is to learn whether cobimetinib is safe and effective in subjects diagnosed with LCH, LCH-ND, RDD, JXG and ECD which may have a specific mutation called BRAF-V600E. In healthy cells, certain proteins (called BRAF and MEK) are thought to help control normal cell growth. BRAF-V600E is a specific change in a gene that may cause cancer cells to grow and spread by sending constant signals to the MEK protein. Cobimetinib is designed to attach to and block the activity of MEK.",

    "detailed_description": "Locoregional failure remains the principal mode of mortality in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with conventional chemoradiation therapy. Radiation dose escalation with hypofractionation has shown unparalleled local control in other malignancies, such as non-small cell lung cancer, but has been limited in HNSCC due to toxicity concerns. Magnetic resonance-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) allows for adaptive radiation dose escalation based on tumor response and may improve therapeutic outcomes while limiting toxicities.\n\nThis protocol evaluates a novel framework for radiation delivery using MRgRT with concurrent atezolizumab in patients with advanced HNSCC. Unlike conventional radiotherapy, Dose-Escalated Hypofractionated Adaptive Radiotherapy (DEHART) modifies radiation dose using MRgRT by adapting the radiation plan during the course of treatment, escalating radiation dose to residual tumor while deescalating radiation dose to areas of tumor regression. The hypothesis is that DEHART will safely deliver ablative radiation doses in 15 fractions over 3 weeks while limiting both toxicity and the effect of tumor repopulation by resistant clonogens, thus resulting in an improved therapeutic ratio.\n\nThis Phase I clinical trial will encompass the following specific aims: (1) determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the DEHART regimen delivered using MRgRT with concurrent atezolizumab in a population of patients who are not candidates or unsuitable for definitive chemoradiation therapy; (2) evaluate the toxicity and functional outcomes of the DEHART regimen; and (3) assess the efficacy of DEHART and obtain volumetric and functional imaging correlates of efficacy using MRgRT to serve as hypothesis-generating data for future trials of radiation dose adaptation. A modified Time-to Event Continual Reassessment (TITE-CRM) Phase I Design with three radiation dose levels delivered to regressing disease will be used to determine the MTD: 50 Gy in 15 fractions, 55 Gy in 15 fractions and 60 Gy in 15 fractions.\n\nIf DEHART is found to be safe and shows a signal of efficacy in this study, a future Phase II trial will be conducted to compare this novel treatment strategy to standard-of care conventionally fractionated chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced HNSCC.",

ASTX727 is a combination of cedazuridine and decitabine. Cedazuridine is in a class of medications called cytidine deaminase inhibitors. It prevents the breakdown of decitabine, making it more available in the body so that decitabine will have a greater effect. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Entrectinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of the abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps to stop or slow the spread of cancer cells. Giving ASTX727 and entrectinib together may kill more tumor cells in patients with AML.",

    "brief_summary": "This phase II trial tests whether mosunetuzumab and/or polatuzumab vedotin helps benefit patients who have received chemotherapy (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) followed by chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy (tisagenlecleucel, axicabtagene ciloleucel, or lisocabtagene maraleucel) for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that has come back (recurrent) or that does not respond to treatment (refractory) or grade IIIb follicular lymphoma. Mosunetuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Polatuzumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, called polatuzumab, linked to a drug called vedotin. Polatuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, and delivers vedotin to kill them. Chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor. Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. Giving mosunetuzumab and/or polatuzumab vedotin after chemotherapy and CAR T-cell therapy may be more effective at controlling or shrinking the cancer than not giving them.",

Auto-antibodies are produced when the normal defense mechanism of the body goes wrong and begins to attack the body, similar to \"friendly fire.\" Auto-antibodies attack brain receptors and then the person who has this problem begins to have hallucinations and other manifestations of schizophrenia, like feeling that people can see what they are thinking and also feeling that other people do not like them. If this disease is caused by auto-antibodies, typically the person is well until they are 15 years of age or older, but seldom older than 35 years. Then, in a matter of a few months they begin to have hallucinations and the other symptoms. Doctors still do not know whether some people with schizophrenia or bipolar disease have auto-antibodies attacking their brain. For this reason, in this study some of these patients will receive a treatment that suppresses the auto-antibodies and their symptoms after treatment will be compared with the symptoms of a group of similar patients who are given a preparation that looks like the real treatment, but it is not.",

    "detailed_description": "This is a randomized phase II adjuvant study for women and men with Stage I HER2-positive invasive breast cancer. Participants will be randomized into one of two treatment arms in this study and receive:\n\n* Arm 1: trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1, Kadcyla) and trastuzumab SC (Herceptin Hylecta)\n* Arm 2: paclitaxel and trastuzumab SC (Herceptin Hylecta) This research study is looking to see if the study drug T-DM1 followed by trastuzumab SC will have less side-effects than traditional HER2-positive breast cancer treatment of trastuzumab and paclitaxel.The study is also looking to learn about the long-term benefits and disease-free survival of participants who are treated with T-DM1 followed by trastuzumab SC.\n\nT-DM1 is an antibody-drug conjugate; it is made up of an antibody (trastuzumab) linked to a cytotoxic drug, DM1 (chemotherapy). T-DM1 functions as a targeted cancer therapy because it targets HER2-positive breast cancer cells directly, limiting exposure of the rest of the body to chemotherapy. More specifically, the trastuzumab in T-DM1 first binds to the HER2 protein on the surface of the breast cancer cells and the DM1 then enters the cells and can cause them to die, preventing tumor growth. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved T-DM1 for use on its own in patients with stage I, II, or III breast cancer. However, it has been approved for use in (a) advanced or metastatic, previously treated breast cancer and (b) in some patients receiving postoperative treatment after preoperative chemotherapy and surgery have been completed.\n\nTrastuzumab SC is a subcutaneous form of trastuzumab.Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody, which are disease-fighting proteins made by cloned immune cells. Paclitaxel and trastuzumab are considered a standard-of-care regimen in early breast cancer. Trastuzumab is FDA-approved to be administered as an IV (intravenous) or subcutaneous (muscular injection).\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including laboratory evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment for a year in total and will be followed for 5 years after treatment.\n\nIt is expected that about 500 people will take part in this research study.\n\nGenentech is supporting this research study by providing funding for the study and supplying trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) and trastuzumab SC (subcutaneous).",

Cutaneous melanoma in its earliest stages before it has spread to other areas of the body can usually be cured with surgery alone. Unfortunately, some cutaneous melanomas have a greater likelihood of coming back after surgery. Your immune system is normally your body's first defense against threats like cancer. But sometimes cancer cells produce signals that allow them to hide from attack by the immune system. One such signal is called programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Atezolizumab is a drug that blocks PD-L1. By blocking PD-L1, atezolizumab may boost your immune system to keep your cutaneous melanoma from coming back after surgery.",

    "detailed_description": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can be transmitted from the mother to the fetus and is a leading cause of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), which is a condition where the inner ear is unable to convert sound into nerve impulses to the brain. This hearing loss and its detrimental effect on language development contribute nearly $4 billion annually to the health care costs in the U.S. Unlike other types of SNHL, CMV induced hearing loss can be treated. Several clinical trials have demonstrated that antiviral therapy may prevent progressive hearing loss if administered early in life for severely affected (symptomatic CMV) infants. These promising findings have given rise to a debate regarding the best method for identifying and treating the more numerous asymptomatic CMV-infected infants.\n\nOne approach is to conduct universal newborn hearing screens, and then do CMV diagnostic testing only on the infants who fail the hearing screen. This targeted approach should identify those infants at greatest risk of developing progressive hearing loss and consequent communicative difficulties. Utah is the first state to mandate this approach whereby infants under three weeks of age who fail their newborn hearing screening undergo CMV testing. In this trial, the hearing screen targeted approach will be used to identify patients eligible for participation in a double blind placebo controlled randomized clinical trial of antiviral valganciclovir therapy. The results of this trial will inform public policy, potentially shift our current clinical practice regarding pediatric hearing loss evaluation, and potentially offer a therapeutic option to asymptomatic CMV-infected infants with SNHL.",

    "detailed_description": "Von Willebrand Disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder affecting up to 0.1% of the population, is usually characterized by mucocutaneous bleeding, HMB, surgical bleeding or other hemostatic challenges. VWD currently has few therapies generally useful in management of bleeding events including antifibrinolytics, desmopressin (DDAVP), and VWF concentrates, which may be plasma-derived (VWF with and without FVIII) or recombinant. Minor bleeding may be successfully treated with antifibrinolytics and DDAVP; however, more severe bleeding requires VWF concentrates that are administered solely through intravenous access.\n\nSimilarly, it can be challenging to treat concomitant bleeding disorders with the existing therapeutic options available, and patients with concurrent VWD and hemophilia A primarily have VWF/FVIII concentrate or desmopression (DDAVP) available for treatment. It has been well-recognized that patients, caregivers, and medical providers desire additional, simplified therapeutic options that are not intravenous to treat severe bleeding disorders. Therefore, a simplified, subcutaneous therapeutic that prevents bleeding would be strongly desired. Though its use in the hemophilia A population is growing, additional potential emicizumab applications for hemostatic control in other hemostatic disorders remain unknown. A recent case report highlighted the hemostatic efficacy of emicizumab off-label use in type 3 von Willebrand Disease (VWD), another severe bleeding disorder. This pediatric patient had type 3 VWD with alloantibodies and a bleeding phenotype similar to hemophilia A with inhibitor patients, requiring suboptimal bleeding management with rFVIIa and activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCC). Emicizumab prophylaxis was initiated and the patient no longer required aPCC prophylaxis and rare use of rFVIIa for acute bleeding events (only 1 trauma-induced soft tissue hematoma at the time of publication). The authors concluded their report suggested the bleeding phenotype in type 3 VWD is expressed mainly due to factor VIII deficiency. This study suggests a potential additional application for emicizumab in severe VWD.\n\nA pilot multicenter, prospective open-label study of emicizumab prophylaxis in severe VWD and concomitant VWD/hemophilia A. Patients will have a one-year retrospective chart review of annualized bleed rate and hemostatic therapies collected at the time of enrollment. Patients will then be treated with emicizumab with 3mg/kg weekly for 4 weeks loading dose, followed by once weekly prophylaxis of 1.5mg/kg for 1 year. Per emicizumab FDA-approved prescribing information for hemophilia A, dose up-titration to 3 mg/kg once weekly will be allowed after 24 weeks on HEMLIBRA prophylaxis in case of suboptimal efficacy (i.e., \u2265 2 spontaneous and clinically significant bleeds) Treatment records will be maintained along with bleeding event logs. Breakthrough bleeding events may be treated with the patients usual on-demand therapy with antifibrinolytics or VWF/FVIII concentrates per clinician discretion. Patient reported outcome assessments will be collected throughout the clinical study to collect impact of the treatment on the individual patients, assessing quality of life, physical, emotional, social and general symptoms.",

The port will be used to give the intravenous medications.\n* During the first cycle, the participant will receive trastuzumab intravenously on Day 1. Cycle 2 will then start one week later. On this day, bevacizumab will be given intravenously first followed by trastuzumab and then oxaliplatin. The participant will then start taking capecitabine tablets orally twice a day for 14 days.

    "brief_summary": "This research study is evaluating the combination of three drugs - acalabrutinib, venetoclax, and obinutuzumab -- as a possible treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).\n\nThe drugs involved in this study are:\n\n* Acalabrutinib\n* Venetoclax\n* Obinutuzmab",
    "detailed_description": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of investigational drugs to learn whether the drugs work in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drugs are being studied. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved acalabrutinib for CLL, although it is FDA-approved for patients with relapsed mantle cell lymphoma. The FDA has approved venetoclax and obinutuzumab separately for the treatment of patients with CLL. However, the FDA has not approved the combination of these three drugs together (acalabrutinb, venetoclax, and obinutuzumab) as a treatment for any disease. This combination is investigational. In this research study, the investigators are trying to learn if giving the three drugs together can safely and effectively treat CLL.\n\nAcalabrutinib is a type of drug called a kinase inhibitor. It blocks a type of protein called Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) that helps CLL cells live and grow. By blocking BTK, acalabrutinib may kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. As of September 2017, acalabrutinib has been administered to more than 2,000 people including healthy volunteers, patients with cancers, and patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A few hundred patients with CLL have been treated with acalabrutinib as a single drug, and some of these patients had improvement of their cancer with this treatment.\n\nObinutuzumab is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody. It targets a protein on the surface of the CLL cell, causing it to die. Obintuzumab has already been shown to be safe and effective at treating CLL, and is FDA-approved when given together with chemotherapy.\n\nVenetoclax is an oral drug that blocks the function of a protein called BCL-2. CLL cancer cells are thought to depend on the BCL-2 protein for their survival. By blocking BCL-2, venetoclax may kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. Venetoclax has been shown to be safe and effective when given alone to treat patients with CLL and is FDA-approved for patients with CLL after their disease has worsened after at least 1 prior therapy.\n\nIf, after 15 or 24 cycles of this investigational therapy, participants have a complete response to the drugs in this trial -- meaning that the investigators cannot detect any CLL using CT scans, bone marrow biopsy and a sensitive test called minimal residual disease (MRD) testing -- participants will stop therapy with acalabrutinib and venetoclax. The investigators will continue to monitor participants while they are off of therapy, and if the CLL comes back participants will be able to restart acalabrutinib and venetoclax. The use of MRD testing to identify small amounts of CLL is investigational, meaning that it has not been FDA-approved. The use of results from this test to guide the decision to stop and re-start therapy, as is done in the trial here, is also investigational.",

    "detailed_description": "Risdiplam is an orally bioavailable small molecule that distributes into the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral tissues where it modifies SMN2 pre-mRNA splicing and increases tissue SMN protein levels. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for all SMA patients older than 2 months of age in August 2020.\n\nClinical trial data prompted us to consider risdiplam a reasonable alternative to nusinersen administered intrathecally or by subcutaneous intrathecal catheter (SIC) for patients with more advanced SMA. Considered within this clinical context, risdiplam presents a significant advantage by eliminating the risks of mechanical failure, intrathecal bleeding, and CNS infection associated with the SIC device. The schedule of assessments (SOAs) used in this cohort during the previous three-year period as part of a nusinersen study provide us with an established framework for data collection. Thus, the overall clinical experience with risdiplam as compared to nusinersen can be assessed using a prospective, crossover design in a real-world setting.",

However, relapse rates remain high and are primarily due to distant, metastatic disease. Previous meta-analysis evaluating the use of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy demonstrate a similar impact on improved disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The role of checkpoint inhibitors has been proven to be effective in the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC, regardless of histology and PD-L1 expression. Results from trials evaluating the use of checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting for early stage disease are promising. However, there are no trials evaluating the role of concomitant chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors in the adjuvant setting. In addition, emerging data supports the use of ctDNA as a promising biomarker for early detection of minimal residual disease and have indicated that the presence of detectable ctDNA after surgery for localized lung cancer is correlated with a 90-100% chance for disease recurrence. Therefore, we propose this current study assessing concomitant chemotherapy plus Atezolizumab in the adjuvant setting for patients with stage I (tumors \u2265 4cm), IIA, IIB (and select stage III) NSCLC who have detectable ctDNA after surgery. The clearance of ctDNA will serve as a surrogate for long term DFS and OS in this patient population.",

Monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

    "detailed_description": "Influenza infections are a significant concern for the clinical management of transplant recipients, a highly vulnerable immunocompromised patient group. Early Influenza detection has major benefits for the successful treatment in that crucial early infection time window and allows for more timely mitigation measures to be employed. Xofluza\u00ae (Baloxavir Marboxil), FDA approved in 2018 for the treatment of acute Influenza, has been shown to have improved outcome characteristics versus Tamiflu\u00ae (Oseltamivir), as well as compliance (a single pill given once, versus 10 pills taken over 5 days for Oseltamivir). The timing of the influenza diagnoses and intervention greatly impacts the outcomes in both antiviral medications though. Smart wearable devices have demonstrated clear utility to detect early infection using physiological signatures such as sub-symptomatic increases in heart rate (HR) and body temperature. Detection of Influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been shown to be robustly detectable several days prior to clinical symptoms onset in large well-powered smartwatch studies.\n\nThis is a sub-study of the existing Institutional Review Board (IRB) # 20-017872 protocol: \"Early Detection of SARS-CoV-2 \\& other Infections using Wearable Devices in Pediatric Transplant Patients and Household Members\". This is a prospective, interventional, single-center study at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia comprising kidney, heart, liver and lung transplant recipients, waitlisted patients, and their household members. Subjects will wear smart wearable devices to monitor biometrics including HR, HR variation (HRV) and proxies of body temperature. A smart wearable device alert generated from a validated early infection detection algorithm and alerting platform, precipitates subjects to use an at-home collection kit for SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A/B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A/B which is then sent to a central clinical lab for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnoses. If the transplant recipient is positive for Influenza A/B the local clinical care team will be informed to determine if Baloxavir and/or any other medication is warranted. Genentech will make the Baloxavir medication available via the CHOP transplant pharmacist through the recipients' regular pharmacy. If the non-transplanted household members are positive for Influenza or exposed to Influenza positive infected subject(s) their treatment will be determined by their own primary-care. All CHOP transplant recipients will have their medical records reviewed for relevant covariates and confounders after Baloxavir treatment. Study subjects will complete short daily REDCap symptom forms for the pre-, peri- and post-infection periods.",

The usual chemotherapy in this study is paclitaxel (WP) and carboplatin followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) or epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC). Usually, after neoadjuvant therapy and surgery for triple negative breast cancer, no additional treatment is given unless the cancer returns. This study will also look at continuing treatment after surgery with atezolizumab or the placebo. To be better, atezolizumab given with the neoadjuvant therapy should be better at: 1) decreasing the amount of tumor in the breast than the placebo given with the usual chemotherapy and 2) decreasing the chance of the cancer from returning after surgery.\n\nAnother purpose of this study is to test the good and bad effects of atezolizumab when added to the usual chemotherapy. Atezolizumab may keep your cancer from growing but it can also cause side effects.",
    "detailed_description": "NSABP B-59/GBG 96-GeparDouze is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, Phase III clinical trial. This is a collaborative study being conducted by NSABP Foundation, Inc. in partnership with the German Breast Group (GBG), and supported by funding by Genentech, a Member of the Roche Group, and F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd.\n\nIn this clinical trial of neoadjuvant and adjuvant administration of atezolizumab/placebo in patients with high risk triple-negative breast cancer, the potential incremental efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant administration of atezolizumab/placebo with a sequential regimen of weekly paclitaxel with every-3-week carboplatin followed immediately by neoadjuvant administration of atezolizumab/placebo with AC/EC will be evaluated. Patients will then undergo surgery. Following recovery from surgery, patients will initiate approximately 6 months of adjuvant therapy with atezolizumab/placebo and receive the same investigational agent they received pre-operatively. Administration of radiation therapy will be based on local standards at the discretion of patients and investigators, but if administered, atezolizumab/placebo will be administered concurrently. Adjuvant atezolizumab/placebo may be delayed until after completion of radiation therapy per investigator discretion. Patients with residual invasive cancer at the time of surgery may receive capecitabine concurrently with atezolizumab/placebo in the adjuvant setting per investigator discretion and local guidelines. Patients with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations with residual invasive cancer at the time of surgery may receive olaparib in the adjuvant setting per investigator discretion and local guidelines. Patients receiving olaparib must discontinue atezolizumab/placebo.\n\nThe primary aims of the study are 1) to determine value of atezolizumab in improving pathologic complete response in the breast and post-therapy lymph nodes evaluated histologically (pCR breast and nodes \\[(ypT0/Tis ypN0)\\]), and 2) to determine the value of atezolizumab in improving event-free survival (EFS). Secondary aims include: pathologic complete response in the breast (ypT0/Tis); pathologic complete response in the breast and lymph nodes (ypT0 ypN0); positive nodal status conversion rate; overall survival; recurrence-free interval: distant disease-free survival; brain metastases free survival; and toxicity. The stratification factors for the study are: 1) clinical size of the primary tumor (1.1-3.0 cm; \\> 3.0 cm); 2) nodal status as determined by protocol-specified criteria (negative, positive); 3) AC/EC (every 2 weeks; every 3 weeks); and 4) Region (North America; Europe).\n\nFor patient eligibility, local testing on the diagnostic core must have determined the patient's tumor to be ER-negative, PgR-negative, and HER2-negative by current ASCO/CAP guidelines. Material from either the diagnostic core biopsy or the research biopsy must be sent for central testing for confirmation of ER, PgR, and HER2 to confirm eligibility. If local testing has determined a tumor to be HER2 equivocal or to have a borderline ER/PgR status (% IHC staining \\< 10% for both), material may be submitted for central testing to determine eligibility.\n\nIn order to proactively identify and further assess any cardiac toxicity that may occur with the combination of anthracyclines and atezolizumab, this study includes a cardiac safety lead-in for the first 60 patients who initiate AC/EC. The safety lead-in will consist of assessment of ECG and serum troponin-T obtained just prior to administration of the first dose of AC/EC, following completion of the administration of the 1st and 3rd cycle of AC/EC prior to initiation of the atezolizumab/placebo. An additional assessment of LVEF with echocardiogram or MUGA scan will also be obtained prior to the 3rd dose of AC/EC. In order to provide an early assessment of cardiac safety, results of the troponin-T assessments, ECGs, LVEF assessment, and cardiac safety data will be evaluated by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) when the last of the initial 20 patients who initiate AC/EC undergo their scheduled post-surgery LVEF assessment. When the last of the first 60 patients to initiate AC/EC undergo their scheduled post-surgery LVEF assessment, results of the troponin assessments, ECGs, LVEF assessments, and cardiac safety data from all 60 patients will be evaluated by the DSMB.\n\nResearch core biopsies of breast primary at baseline and 1-4 days prior to the second dose of atezolizumab/placebo are a study requirement for all patients. One to three representative blocks of residual primary tumor containing the maximum amount of tumor and node with the largest focus of metastasis is required from the definitive breast surgery if gross residual disease is greater than or equal to 1.0 cm. If gross residual disease is less than 1.0 cm, tissue should be submitted, if possible. Blood specimens will be collected on all patients at baseline for exploratory biomarker analysis and to support future correlative studies.\n\nAccrual to NSABP B-59/GBG 96-GeparDouze began in December 2017 and was completed in May 2021 with a total of 1550 patients randomized. Based on actual accrual and the decision to eliminate pCR as a co-primary endpoint, we recalculated the power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.70 attributed to the addition of atezolizumab, assuming a lost-to-follow-up rate of 0.00083 per month, using the actual accrual pattern for the power calculation. With 1550 patients accrued in 42 months, an additional 22 months follow up will allow us to obtain 252 events under the assumptions stated above, which will provide 80% power to detect a HR of 0.7 between the atezolizumab and the placebo arm at an overall 2-sided alpha level of 0.05.",

Functional outcome will be assessed in the short-term by the NIHSS and at 90-days by the modified Rankin Scale.\n\nN=20 acute stroke patients will be enrolled after successful recanalization of a proximal anterior circulation LVO (internal carotid artery or first segment of the middle cerebral artery). After standard of care MT, every patient will undergo a quantitative angiographic assessment with syngo iFLOW (Siemens Healthineers). More specifically, 2D angiographic images will be acquired with a 8 Fr catheter located in the extracranial C2-C4 segment of the internal carotid artery. 6 mLs of contrast agent will be injected at a flow rate of 4 mL/sec (standardized injection via power injector). The 2D imaging will be acquired at a rate of 4 frames per second to acquire images in anterior-posterior and lateral positions. Images will be transferred to the workstation at which syngo iFLOW software will enable quantification of the microvascular cerebral circulation time (mCCT). Post-processing via iFLOW requires 1-2 minutes. ROI selection to quantify mCCT requires approximately 2-5 minutes.\n\nAfter post-MT mCCT is quantified, the catheter will be advanced to the distal M1 segment of the MCA (distal to lenticulostriates). 0.125 mg/kg (max 12.5mg) of TNK (i.e. 50% of the IV dose) will be administered via a 5-minute intraarterial infusion (using a programmable syringe pump). As described in section 3.3.1, the dose may be modified as clinical trial data become available, if the available data identify an alternative dose to be optimal.\n\n10 minutes post-TNK, the quantitative angiographic assessment will be repeated to calculate the post-treatment mCCT. The primary objective of this trial is to quantify the change in mCCT associated with IA-TNK treatment.\n\nPost-treatment clinical monitoring will continue as per institutional standard of care (post-MT and post-TNK monitoring). Standard of care NCCT, in addition to protocol CTA/CTP, will be performed 24 hours post-TNK to secondarily assess recanalization, reperfusion, and safety (i.e. hemorrhagic complications).

    "detailed_description": "This is a single arm, phase 4, prospective, open-label, United States single-center study to develop laboratory data and assess the clinical hemostatic efficacy and safety of Hemlibra (emicizumab) for hemostatic control of mild hemophilia A patients (baseline FVIII activity, \\>5 to 30%). Males aged \u22655 years to \u226445 years without inhibitors are eligible for enrollment. Secondary outcomes will assess changes in quality of life and joint health in treated patients.\n\nApproximately 20 patients will be enrolled. As much as possible, the patient population will be selected to provide a variety of FVIII activity levels and F8 genetic defects.\n\nCarrier females are not eligible for the study as the goal is to examine the effect of altered FVIII on Hemlibra (emicizumab) binding; carrier females with FVIII levels in the mild range of deficiency have one altered and one normal F8 gene that results in a mixture of both normal and altered FVIII proteins thereby complicating the interpretation of study results.\n\nPatients with a FVIII inhibitor (or a history of a FVIII inhibitor) are not eligible for this study; if a subject develops a FVIII inhibitor during the study, they will be withdrawn from the study and offered the current standard of care.\n\nPatients \\<5 years of age will be excluded from the study due to 1) the number of blood draws and the quantity of blood required; and 2) likelihood of reaching a minimum weight to utilize Stimate (\\~20 kg).\n\nPatients with risk factors for thrombosis or TMA will be excluded from the study. Patients \\>45 years of age, \\>30 BMI, with a history of CVD, or \\>20% risk of CVD over a 10-year period using the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimator will also be excluded to minimize potential adverse events.\n\nPatients with any number of FVIII exposure days are eligible for enrollment, as are previously untreated patients (PUPs). Although expected to be an uncommon occurrence, PUPs may be at risk of developing FVIII inhibitors while enrolled in the study due to exogenous FVIII exposure if required; as such they will be tested (bovine chromogenic modified inhibitor assay) after FVIII exposure per IHTC standard guidelines (after an episode of intensive treatment, between 3-5 EDs and then at 10 ED, etc.) Should a FVIII inhibitor develop in a PUP while on study, they will be removed from the study and offered the current standard of care.\n\nTo ensure no other bleeding disorders are present that might confound responses or lead to the development of a bleeding event unrelated to the underlying diagnosis of mild hemophilia A, a VWD panel and blood group will be obtained during screening.\n\nHemlibra (emicizumab) will be administered as weekly prophylaxis using the FDA-approved weekly dosing regimen following the enrollment/screening visit (first study visit) and the administration of the 4 weekly loading doses (second study visit). A choice of other approved dosing regimens (Q2W or Q4W) will not be offered as the primary regimen to limit variability in Cmin/Cmax exposure levels. The weekly prophylaxis regimen was selected to be the easiest for mild hemophilia A patients to remember as they are rarely on FVIII prophylaxis and infrequently need to administer on-demand hemostatic agents.\n\nBleeding events will be recorded and treated with locally available hemostatic agents (eg, Stimate \\[DDAVP/desmopressin acetate\\], pdFVIII, rFVIII, etc) as required. If FVIII is required for treatment of a bleeding event, the dose expected to achieve hemostasis will be utilized.\n\nThe enrollment period is 37 months; with a total study period of 60 months. The study comprises 2 parts following screening. Subjects will initially be enrolled in Part A (12 months) including a 1-month period of Hemlibra dose administration and collection of baseline laboratory data, with the option of enrolling in part B (12 months) upon successful completion of Part A and approval of the Study Investigator. Up to a 1-month window is provided between screening and administration of the first loading dose, depending on the return of required laboratory testing data and subject availability. When subjects complete the study, they will be requested to meet with their IHTC hemophilia physician to resume their previous therapeutic regimen or be offered the current standard of care.\n\nPart A Loading dose administration (month 1 \u00b12 days):\n\nThis is a 1-month (\u00b12 days) period during which the 4 weekly loading doses of Hemlibra (emicizumab) will be administered. Additionally, baseline laboratory data, banked plasma samples, MSKUS imaging and quality of life questionnaires will be completed.\n\nPart A Maintenance Hemlibra therapy \\[months 2-13 (\u00b12 weeks)\\]:\n\nThe purpose of this section of Part A is to collect laboratory data to determine the impact of Hemlibra (emicizumab) on laboratory coagulation parameters including thrombin generation in patients with circulating levels of endogenous altered FVIII (\\>5% to 30% baseline FVIII activity). Laboratory data will be collected at month 4 (\u00b12 weeks), month 7 (\u00b12 weeks) and month 13 (\u00b12 weeks). Additional data, including bleeding events, bleed treatment, intercurrent procedures, quality of life (Haemo-QoL and CATCH questionnaires if \\<17 years of age; Haem-A-QoL and CATCH questionnaires if \u226517 years of age) and joint health (MSKUS) will be collected at baseline and 12 months (\u00b12 weeks).\n\nA Stimate/DDAVP challenge may occur at either the 4-month (\u00b12 weeks) or 7-month (\u00b12 weeks) study visit to investigate the hemostatic characteristics of Hemlibra (emicizumab) in the presence of elevated levels of altered FVIII using coagulation laboratory assays. The Stimate/DDAVP challenge will not be performed if the patient has a documented history of lack of response as defined by an increase of FVIII \\< 2 times baseline level. The Stimate/DDAVP challenge may be delayed to a later study visit due to recent treatment (within the previous 4 days) with a FVIII concentrate or Stimate (DDAVP/desmopressin acetate) or for convenience (at the discretion of the Study Investigator). The Stimate/DDAVP challenge may also be delayed or its route of administration altered if a subject weighs \u226510kg to \\<20kg; a weight-based subcutaneous dose of DDAVP/desmopressin acetate may be administered for subjects \\<20 kg at the discretion of the Study Investigator). The Stimate/DDAVP challenge may be delayed to a later study visit if the intranasal route of administration is compromised and subcutaneous administration of DDAVP/desmopressin acetate is not planned. See Section 3.1.9 for full details on the Stimate/DDAVP challenge.\n\nPart B \\[months 14-25 (\u00b12 weeks)\\]:\n\nUpon successful completion of Part A, subjects may continue Hemlibra (emicizumab) treatment by enrolling in Part B if approved by the Study Investigator and per patient desire to continue treatment. The goal of Part B is to acquire additional data on bleeding events, bleed treatment, intercurrent procedures, changes in quality of life (Haemo-QoL and CATCH questionnaires if \\<17 years of age; Haem-A-QoL and CATCH questionnaires if \u226517 years of age) and joint health (MSKUS). This extended collection period is desired due to the infrequent and variable ABR in individuals with mild hemophilia A. Subjects will receive Hemlibra (emicizumab treatment in Part B for 12 months.\n\nThe study is seeking to address the following knowledge gaps:\n\n* Is Hemlibra (emicizumab)-conferred hemostatic coverage additive to the activity of the endogenous altered FVIII protein in mild hemophilia A patients or is there evidence that endogenous altered FVIII protein is competitive with Hemlibra (emicizumab)?\n* Do specific FVIII mutations confer more or less additive or competitive effect? In silico simulations of the altered protein (based upon the patient's genetic alteration) may be investigated to predict the protein's in vivo function and interaction with Hemlibra (emicizumab) binding (secondary exploratory goal)\n* What is the hemostatic contribution of Hemlibra (emicizumab) in the presence of maximal endogenous altered FVIII protein release (Stimate/DDAVP challenge with coagulation laboratory assays)?\n* Are there patients with specific genetic mutations who would benefit from Hemlibra (emicizumab) usage, or can a sub-population of patients of mild hemophilia be identified for whom Hemlibra (emicizumab) would not represent optimal therapy?\n* Is weekly Hemlibra (emicizumab) safe to administer in patients with mild hemophilia A and does it reduce the incidence of bleeding events or the need for alternate hemostatic agents, including during/following surgeries and procedures?\n* Does weekly prophylactic Hemlibra (emicizumab) result in an increase in QoL and/or activity in mild hemophilia A patients?\n* Does weekly prophylactic Hemlibra (emicizumab) result in an improvement in joint health (ie, the control of progression, stabilization or regression of joint damage) using 6 joint point of care musculoskeletal",

    "brief_summary": "Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) beyond Milan Criteria (MC) who are transplant-eligible will be treated with 6 months of neoadjuvant/downstaging atezolizumab plus bevacizumab while receiving standard of care transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). We hypothesize that atezolizumab and bevacizumab can appropriately bridge patients with HCC beyond MC to transplantation and not increase the risk of 1-year post-transplant rejection.",
    "detailed_description": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the second most common cause of cancer-related death and accounts for over 80% of primary liver cancers worldwide.(1) Curative treatment options include surgical resection in patients with well compensated liver function and radio frequency ablation in small tumors. However, in 90% of patients, HCC occurs in the setting of cirrhosis(2) where optimal management remains liver transplantation (LT) with 5-year survival rates of approximately 80%.(3) Despite the success of LT in treating HCC, only a small portion of patients fit into standard Milan Criteria to receive a LT due to 1) advanced-stage disease and/or large tumor size preventing/delaying organ allocation and 2) a lack of neoadjuvant (bridging) therapies that can effectively down-stage or delay tumor progression for patients while on the LT waiting list. The proposed clinical trial will evaluate the feasibility of using a combination of the chemotherapeutic interventions atezolizumab(4) and bevacizumab(5) in a group of patients with HCC who have tumors beyond the Milan Criteria (in brief, 5 - 10 cm), in order to appropriately bridge them to liver transplantation without increasing the risk of graft rejection within 1-year post-LT.\n\nGlobally, Milan Criteria (MC),(6) defined as one single tumor \\< 5cm or 3 tumors \\< 3cm, is the most commonly recognized criteria for selecting patients for deceased donor LT. However, it is increasingly recognized that these criteria may be restrictive and not always reflect biology of the disease.(3) Variable extended strategies have been employed including the i) extended Toronto Criteria(7) (where no limitation in tumor burden is imposed provided the tumor is not poorly differentiated and there is no evidence of extrahepatic disease or vascular invasion), ii) Ontario criteria, where patients are eligible based on Total Tumor Volume (TTV, \u2264 145cm\\^3) and alpha fetoprotein (AFP \\< 1000 ng/mL), or iii) University of California San Francisco criteria (tumor size \u22646.5 cm) and beyond.\n\nA number of centers have implemented downstaging strategies incorporating AFP dynamics to help select who may benefit.(8) Despite similar survival in patients beyond MC successfully receiving a transplant,(7) a considerably higher rate of drop-off from the waiting list exists and survival in this population is particularly poor.(9) Downstaging patients to MC and transplant most commonly involves locoregional therapies (LRT); however, for patients who do not reach transplant, the long term survival after receiving systemic treatments is low.\n\nThe IMbrave150 study of atezolizumab and bevacizumab versus sorafenib demonstrated response rates of 29.8% vs 12%, respectively, and median overall survival of 19.8 months in the combination arm versus 13.4 months in the sorafenib alone arm (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.52, 0.85; p=0.0009).(10) The synergistic effect of an antiangiogenic plus immune checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) can reactivate the intra-tumoral trafficking of cytotoxic T cells and create a favorable immune microenvironment for CPI antitumoral activity.(11)\n\nThis study has now shifted the treatment paradigm in HCC, suggesting a new standard of care in intermediate stage HCC refractory to local therapies and those with advanced stage disease eligible for first line treatment.(12) This data highlights the importance of systemic treatment in the management of HCC and challenges historical treatment paradigms. It further emphasizes the need to maintain liver function so that patients can receive systemic therapies.\n\nThere is little data to support systemic treatments both in the neoadjuvant setting and as a bridging or downstaging strategy to liver transplantation. Continued eligibility and timing of transplantation are crucial factors which can be influenced by donor availability, Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and blood group. A recent case report has, however, demonstrated the feasibility of PD-1 blockade prior to orthotopic liver transplantation with no evidence of disease recurrence 1-year post-transplant. Nivolumab (OPDIVO, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Princeton, NJ USA)(13) was stopped in this case 6 weeks prior to transplant.(14) The half-life of 27 days for atezolizumab and 20 days for bevacizumab suggests a need to stop at a similar time point when using atezolizumab/bevacizumab.\n\nAtezolizumab (TECENTRIQ\u00ae, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) is a humanized immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody that targets PD L1 and inhibits the interaction between PD-L1 and its receptors, PD-1 and B7-1 (also known as CD80), both of which function as inhibitory receptors expressed on T cells. Therapeutic blockade of PD-L1 binding by atezolizumab has been shown to enhance the magnitude and quality of tumor-specific T-cell responses, resulting in improved anti tumor activity.(15,16) Atezolizumab has minimal binding to Fc receptors, thus eliminating detectable Fc effector function and associated antibody-mediated clearance of activated effector T cells.\n\nAtezolizumab shows anti-tumor activity in both nonclinical models and cancer patients and is being investigated as a potential therapy in a wide variety of malignancies. Atezolizumab is being studied as a single agent in the advanced cancer and adjuvant therapy settings, as well as in combination with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and cancer immunotherapy.\n\nAtezolizumab is approved for the treatment of urothelial carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, small-cell lung cancer, liver and triple-negative lung cancer. Please refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator Brochure (IB) for details on nonclinical and clinical studies.\n\nBevacizumab (AVASTIN\u00ae, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that binds to and inhibits the biologic activity of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in vitro and in vivo assay systems.\n\nBevacizumab was first granted marketing approval in the US on 26 February 2004 in combination with IV 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum. Bevacizumab is approved in over 100 countries for one or more of the following indications: breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, cervical cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, and fallopian-tube cancer.\n\nBevacizumab has been studied in a multitude of Phase I, II, and III clinical trials in more than 22,000 patients and in multiple tumor types. Approximately 1,720,000 patients have been exposed to bevacizumab as a marketed product or in clinical trials. Please refer to the bevacizumab Investigator Brochure for descriptions of all completed Phase I, II, and III trials reported to date.\n\nThe combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab as first-line treatment for non-resectable or metastatic HCC was assessed for safety and efficacy in two studies: GO30140 and YO40245 (IMbrave150).\n\nStudy GO30140 investigated atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in combination as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic HCC.(17) It was a Phase Ib, multicenter, open-label study trial with many arms. Arm A evaluated patients who had not received prior systemic therapy. Arm F included 119 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HCC who were randomized 1:1 to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab or atezolizumab monotherapy as first-line therapy. Study results for Arm A demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) assessment per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) of 37% (36%; 95% CI 26-46). For the patients who responded, 12 patients (12%) achieved a complete response (CR) and 25 patients (24%) achieved a partial response (PR). The combination of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab was generally well tolerated. Arm F demonstrated an objective response rate in 20% (95% CI 11-32), with 1 patient (2%) showing complete response and 11 (18%) with partial response.\n\nStudy YO40245, called IMbrave 150, was a phase III study including 501 randomized patients with unresectable HCC.10 Patients were randomized 2:1 to atezolizumab (1,200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks) plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks) or sorafenib (400 mg twice daily). The duration of their treatment extended until unacceptable toxicity or reduced clinical benefit per the study investigators. There was a significant improvement in overall survival response rates of 29.8% vs 12%, respectively, and median overall survival of 19.8 months in the combination arm versus 13.4 months in the sorafenib alone arm (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.52, 0.85; p=0.0009). The median follow-up was 15.6 months. Median progression-free survival improved to 6.8 months (combination arm) compared to 4.3 months in the sorafenib group (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.47-0.76, p\\< .0001). ORR was also significantly better in the combination group compared to sorafenib (27% vs 12% p\\<0.0001) based on RECIST v1.1. Similar increases were demonstrated using HCC mRECIST18 criteria (33% vs 13%, p\\<0.0001). A comparable amount of Grade 3 - 5 adverse events were seen between groups.\n\nThis trial will enroll patients with locally advanced HCC. Given the relatively poor prognosis and limited treatment options for these patients, this population is considered appropriate for trials of novel therapeutic candidates. The benefit-risk ratio for atezolizumab + bevacizumab is expected to be acceptable in this setting.\n\nEncouraging clinical data emerging in the field of tumor immunotherapy have demonstrated that therapies focused on enhancing T-cell responses against cancer can result in a significant survival benefit in patients with advanced malignancies.(19-21) The PD-L1 pathway serves as an immune checkpoint to temporarily dampen immune responses in states of chronic antigen stimulation, such as chronic infection or cancer. PD L1 is an extracellular protein that downregulates immune responses through binding to its two receptors, PD-1 and B7-1. PD-1 is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells following T-cell activation, and expression is sustained in states of chronic stimulation.(22,23) B7-1 is a molecule expressed on antigen presenting cells and activated T cells. Binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 and B7-1 inhibits T-cell proliferation and activation, cytokine production, and cytolytic activity, leading to the functional inactivation or exhaustion of T cells.(24,25) Overexpression of PD-L1 on tumor cells has been reported to impede anti tumor immunity, resulting in immune evasion.(26) Therefore, interruption of the PD-L1 pathway represents an attractive strategy for restoring tumor-specific T-cell immunity.\n\nThe combination of atezolizumab with bevacizumab is expected to down-grade the tumor size and potentially allow patients to reach the smaller tumor criteria of MC for qualifying for exception points for a liver transplant. Even if the growth is halted and not reduced to MC, stable patients may be able to achieve liver transplant without exception points if a matching donor can be located that would not be suitable for another recipient. These extended criteria donor livers would be discarded yet have shown success in circumstances such as the purpose for the current trial.\n\nLiver transplantation provides the life-saving benefit and curative therapy for liver-limited HCC. Although there has been some success with therapeutics and LRT management for HCC, liver transplantation provides the highest survival outcome (85% at 5-yrs).",

    "brief_summary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects of polatuzumab vedotin when given with combination chemotherapy with or without glofitamab for the treatment of patients with untreated large B-cell lymphoma that grows and spreads quickly and has severe symptoms (aggressive). Polatuzumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, polatuzumab, linked to a toxic agent called vedotin. Polatuzumab attaches to CD79B positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. Glofitamab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as molecules that cause the body to make an immune response (antigens). Drugs used in combination chemotherapy such as etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as prednisone, lower the body's immune response and are used with other drugs in the treatment of some types of cancer. Giving polatuzumab vedotin in combination chemotherapy with or without glofitamab may help treat patients with aggressive large B-cell lymphoma.",
    "detailed_description": "OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 05/23/2024): Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1, polatuzumab vedotin IV on day 1, prednisone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5, etoposide IV on days 1-4, doxorubicin IV on days 1-4, and cyclophosphamide IV on day 5. Patients also receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) 24-72 hours after the last dose of each treatment cycle. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiography during screening and fludeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT) scan, bone marrow biopsy and aspiration and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nARM B: Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1, polatuzumab vedotin IV on day 1, prednisone PO BID on days 1-5, etoposide IV on days 1-4, doxorubicin IV on days 1-4, and cyclophosphamide IV on day 5. Starting with cycle 2, patients also receive glofitamab, over 4 hours, on day 1 and 8 of cycle 2 and day 1 of subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo MUGA scan or echocardiography during screening and FDG PET, CT scan, bone marrow biopsy and aspiration and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nAfter the completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.",
