    "detailed_description": "This is a prospective, open label, multicentre, randomised phase II clinical trial. An adaptive trial design is proposed to allow ineffective treatments to be discontinued early, and to potentially add novel treatment arms as the trial progresses.\n\nPatients will initially receive standard chemotherapy for their locally advanced or metastatic oesophago-gastric adenocarcinoma, according to local practice based upon their HER-2 status (tested locally). In order to be eligible for trial entry, HER-2 negative patients should have received a platinum-fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy doublet of either cisplatin + capecitaine (CX), oxaliplatin + capecitabine (CAPOX), or 5FU + oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) (Arm A), whilst HER-2 positive patients (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+ and FISH positive) should have received cisplatin in combination with either capecitabine or 5-FU (CX or CF) plus trastuzumab chemotherapy (Arm B). Potentially eligible patients will be registered with the trials office whilst undergoing first line chemotherapy.\n\nPatients will become eligible for trial recruitment and randomisation after 18 weeks standard chemotherapy with stable disease (SD) or better on the end-of-treatment CT scan. Please note: if your patient has been receiving a regimen delivered every three weeks (e.g. CX) they should have completed 6 cycles. If your patient has been receiving a regimen delivered every 2 weeks (e.g. FOLFOX) they should have received 9 cycles of treatment. Eligible patients will then be randomised according to HER-2 status as follows:\n\n* HER-2 positive patients (\\~20%) will be assigned maintenance single-agent trastuzumab (current UK standard)\n* HER-2 negative patients (\\~80%) will be randomised 1:1 between surveillance (current UK standard) and maintenance capecitabine.\n\nPatients will be stratified according to: centre region, disease extent and performance status (0 versus 1 versus 2).\n\nReview of patients will occur every 4 weeks in the surveillance arm. In maintenance therapy arms, patients will be reviewed every 3 or every 4 weeks depending upon the treatment strategy. CT assessments of response will occur every 12 weeks (3 months) in all arms of the trial. Treatment will be continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal for another reason.\n\nThe trial is being run from the RM GI and Lymphoma CTU with Professor David Cunningham as the Chief Investigator (CI). Effective arms in the phase II portion of the trial may be taken forward into a phase III maintenance trial powered for overall survival. It is also hoped that, as more robust data becomes available for other biomarker-selected populations (e.g. MET-positive, FGFR-amplified), it may be possible to amend the overall trial design to incorporate these biomarker-targeted maintenance therapies in the HER-2 negative population.",

Stage 1 will determine if treatment with the study drug prevents or slows the rate of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) pathological disease accumulation demonstrated by A\u03b2 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Stage 2 will evaluate the effect of early A\u03b2 plaque reduction/prevention on disease progression by assessing downstream non-A\u03b2 biomarkers of AD (e.g., CSF total tau, p-tau, NfL) compared to an external control group from the DIAN-OBS natural history study and the DIAN-TU-001 placebo-treated participants.",
    "detailed_description": "This study will recruit participants from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network observational study (DIAN-OBS), a multicenter international study supported by the National Institutes of Health (Grant Number U01-AG032438; RJ Bateman), Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) sites, DIAN-TU partner sites, DIAN Expanded Registry (DIAN-EXR), and families identified by the sites. As part of the DIAN-TU-002 protocol, participants undergo longitudinal assessments that include clinical assessment, cognitive testing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and amyloid imaging, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n\nParticipants in DIAN are recruited from families that have at least one member who has been identified as having a mutation linked to dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD). The mutations in presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes that are associated with DIAD have very high penetrance (near 100%). This study will enroll individuals who are either known to have a known disease-causing mutation, or who are at risk for such a mutation (the child or sibling of a proband with a known mutation) and unaware of their genetic status. Because the age at onset of cognitive changes is relatively consistent within each family and for each mutation, an age at onset is determined for each affected parent or mutation as part of the DIAN-OBS study protocol. This study will enroll participants who are asymptomatic and are within a specific window of time of expected age at onset for their family and/or mutation.\n\nThe ability to identify individuals destined to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) with a high degree of confidence provides a unique opportunity to assess the efficacy of therapies at asymptomatic and very early stages of dementia. Families with known disease-causing mutations are extremely rare and are geographically dispersed throughout the world. These constraints necessitate a specialized study design. Participants in this study will not yet have developed any symptoms of AD; they will be \"asymptomatic\" carriers of mutations that cause DIAD and would be expected to perform normally on standard cognitive and functional testing. Further, most mutation carriers will have levels of AD-associated amyloid beta (A\u03b2) and non-A\u03b2 biomarkers that are the same as non-carriers. Imaging and fluid biomarkers will be used to demonstrate that the treatment compounds have engaged their therapeutic targets. A set of cognitive measures designed to assess the very earliest and most subtle cognitive changes will be collected. However, the goal of this study is to address whether decreasing plaque prone A\u03b2 peptides in the absence of measurable or mild elevations of A\u03b2 plaques in participants with minimal to no amyloid plaque at baseline can lead to the subsequent prevention of non-A\u03b2 biomarkers of disease progression. Additionally, because many at-risk individuals decide not to know whether they have the disease-associated mutation, some of the at-risk individuals enrolled in this study will not have the disease-causing mutations; they will be \"mutation-negative.\" It is important to enroll these participants to avoid coercion (e.g., potential participants may feel pressured into genetic testing to learn their genetic status to be eligible for the trial). These mutation-negative individuals will be assigned to the placebo group and data will be used to determine normal ranges of outcome. Participants and site study staff will remain blinded as to these individuals' active or placebo group assignment and mutation status. Thus, the study will be blinded for placebo and for mutation status, except for mutation carriers who are aware of their genetic status. There may be exceptional circumstances as required by local regulation or health authorities where enrollment may be restricted to mutation carriers only, but such mandates will be thoroughly documented and agreed upon by the governing regulatory agency and the study sponsor.\n\nThis study is an adaptive-platform-based study. Several different therapies (each referred to as a study drug arm) may be tested in order to increase the likelihood that an effective treatment will be discovered. The compounds are selected for this trial based on mechanism of action and available data on efficacy and safety profile. In the case of multiple study arms, the study design includes a pooled placebo group (referred to as the mutation positive placebos) shared by all study drug arms. Mutation carriers will be assigned to a study drug arm and subsequently randomized within that arm in an overall 1:1 ratio to active drug: placebo. Mutation-negative participants will all receive placebo treatment. Participants and study staff will not be blinded as to which study drug arm each participant has been assigned; they will be blinded to whether participants have been randomized to receive active drug or placebo.\n\nThe study has 2 treatment periods: Stage 1 is a blinded placebo-controlled period that will continue until the last randomized participant completes 4 years of treatment (i.e., a common close design), and Stage 2 is an open-label period of 4 years (with a planned 2-year interim efficacy analysis) in which all mutation carriers will receive active drug. At the start of Stage 2, participants who were randomized to placebo in Stage 1 will follow the same dose titration schedule and MRI safety schedule used in Stage 1. Participants who were randomized to active drug in Stage 1 will follow a mock dose titration and will have the same MRI safety schedule used during the initial drug titration as Stage 1 but will remain on the dose that they were on at the end of Stage 1. This will protect the blind to the original treatment assignment from Stage 1. Participants, investigators, and the sponsor's clinical team will remain blinded throughout the study to the Stage 1 treatment assignment.\n\nStage 1 of the study is designed to test whether the study drug can slow, prevent, or reverse progression of A\u03b2 pathology associated with AD and Stage 2 is designed to assess the study drug's effect on non-amyloid biomarkers of AD that may lead to future slowing or prevention of clinical symptoms of dementia.\n\nBiomarker, cognitive, and/or clinical endpoints will be specified for each study drug arm. Biomarker data will be analyzed for pre-specified endpoints consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and other AD biomarker outcomes. The clinical and cognitive assessments are designed to assess subtle cognitive changes that may be detectable before the onset of dementia as well as cognitive and clinical decline in symptomatic groups.\n\nRoche announced a decision to discontinue most of the company's global trials of gantenerumab. The DIAN-TU has paused the DIAN-TU-002 Primary Prevention Trial related to gantenerumab while considering other potential options for this platform trial.\n\nThe DIAN-TU plans to re-launch the DIAN-TU-002 Primary Prevention Trial with remternetug in collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company as part of this Master Protocol. The remternetug arm is posted under NCT06647498.",

Secondary endpoints will assess the impact of a centralized precision oncology navigator and expert review of NGS results on enrollment in biomarker-directed clinical trials and overall survival at 2 years after return of NGS results. The study will take approximately 12 months for enrolment and 2 years of follow-up after the date of NGS results.",
    "detailed_description": "Despite data supporting a survival benefit in many cancers, rates of NGS testing and subsequent GIT are reported to be low in real-world data sets. Rates of multigene panel-based testing and targeted therapy use are reported to be higher at NCI-designated cancer centers compared to other practice types, even when they are associated with a \"hub\" site. Molecular tumor boards have demonstrated improvements in overall survival in lung cancer, but these models rely on consults being placed by treating physicians and/or significant institutional resources. Many studies evaluating interventions to increase the use of genome informed therapy (GIT) focus on a single cancer type, thereby hindering the ability to operationalize supportive interventions broadly across all cancer types. Given the collective body of data supporting meaningful clinical improvements when patients have access to GIT, we want to study if interventions that make NGS test ordering and interpretation easier for clinicians will increase the rate of orders for GIT. The use of a centralized precision oncology navigator to facilitate completion of NGS testing, expert clinical review from a clinical pharmacist, and documented clinical decision support embedded in the electronic health record represents a unique and more easily scalable model than full molecular tumor board reviews.",

    "detailed_description": "This is a multi-center, open label Phase II study of patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who will be treated with abemaciclib and atezolizumab alone or in combination.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved abemaciclib or atezolizumab alone or in combination for use in prostate cancer. Abemaciclib is an orally administered molecularly targeted chemotherapy drug called a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which acts to block the ability of cancer cells to divide and thus prevents tumors from growing. In the laboratory setting, this drug is effective in prostate cancer models that have become resistant to standard hormonal treatments, and this drug is currently being studied for its effectiveness in prostate cancer in other clinical trials. Atezolizumab is an intravenously administered drug called an immune checkpoint inhibitor, which acts to activate the immune system to kill cancer cells. Atezolizumab is ineffective on its own in most patients with prostate cancer, but is being tested in combination with other drugs for prostate cancer in other clinical trials. Multiple research groups have demonstrated in laboratory model systems that abemaciclib can may make immune checkpoint inhibitors more effective.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nThe study design divides study participants into two separate cohorts. The first cohort is a set of subjects whose tumors are not known to have mutations in the CDK12 gene (the \"biomarker unselected cohort\") - either because tumor tissue never underwent genetic profiling, or because genetic profiling was performed but did not demonstrate a mutation in the CDK12 gene. In this \"biomarker unselected cohort,\" this study will be testing whether abemaciclib alone or in combination with atezolizumab is an effective treatment strategy.\n\nThe second cohort of participants is a set of subjects whose tumors are known to have mutations in the CDK12 gene based on genetic profiling of the tumor that occurred prior to enrollment on this study. Prior studies suggest that cancers with mutations in the CDK12 gene can shrink in response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. This study will be testing in study participants whose tumors are known to have mutations in CDK12 whether atezolizumab alone or in combination with abemaciclib is an effective treatment strategy.\n\nIn addition, the trial is testing the safety of the combination of the two drugs in both cohorts.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment for as long as they do not have serious side effects and their disease does not get worse. Participants will be followed after completion of study treatment for up to 24 months\n\nIt is expected that about 75 people will take part in this research study.\n\nEli Lilly and Company is supporting this research study by providing funding for research and the study drug abemaciclib.

Is donanemab safe and well-tolerated in people with Down syndrome? Researchers will compare donanemab to a placebo (a look-alike substance that contains no drug) to see if donanemab works to reduce levels of amyloid in the brain.\n\nParticipants in the study will be 35-50 years old and will be in the study for 12 months. Participants will then stay in the study for an additional 12 months in an long-term extension where all participants will receive donanemab. Participants who had a reduction in amyloid (measured by amyloid brain scan) by the end of the first 12 months will receive placebo for the long-term extension, while participants who did not have an amyloid reduction will receive study donanemab for the long-term extension. Everyone (participants and study staff) will remain blinded to treatment for the duration of the study.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Have intravenous (IV) infusions of donanemab (or placebo) every 4 weeks\n* Visit the clinic once every other month for checkups and tests. These tests will include brain scans (magnetic resonance imaging \\[MRI\\] and positron emission tomography \\[PET\\] ), blood draws and memory tests.\n* Have a study partner who who can provide information about the participant and can join participant for some of the study visits.",
    "detailed_description": "The conduct of this Phase 4 clinical study is intended to evaluate the effect of donanemab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, on brain amyloid (centiloids), in the non-demented DS population, with the primary objective of reducing amyloid accumulation. Concurrently, the study aims to investigate the safety and tolerability, and therapeutic potential of donanemab while maintaining the safety and tolerability observed in clinical studies in early AD populations up to the dose of 1400mg.\n\nSafety, tolerability, and efficacy of donanemab will be assessed in a non-demented DS population in the range of 35-50 years of age who are cognitively stable or have Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), which could indicate preclinical and prodromal AD, in a genetic population with \u226518 centiloids on amyloid-PET.\n\nThe study will have a duration of approximately 12 months (52 weeks). A long-term extension (LTE) will also be included, lasting an additional 12 months (52 weeks).",

This study will test the hypothesis that LY2157299 will improve effector T cell tumor infiltration and activity resulting in improved pathologic response rates. The investigators propose that this improved immune response will result in improved disease-free and overall survival.\n\nThe objectives are:\n\n1. Determine the rate of pathologic complete response in patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and the investigational agent LY2157299\n2. Correlate immunoscore changes prior to therapy, during therapy, and at surgical resection with pathologic response and MRI parameters\n3. Immune monitoring to evaluate potential biomarkers of treatment success.\n\nEligible patients will have histologically confirmed rectal adenocarcinoma, AJCC Stage IIA IIIC or AJCC Stage IV appropriate for consideration of primary rectal tumor resection. Patients will undergo a forceps biopsy of the rectal mass as part of the diagnostic workup as well as undergo staging evaluation including an MRI with additional study sequences. Enrolled patients will receive a 14 day course of LY2157299 followed by a repeat biopsy and MRI with study sequences. In this trial the investigators plan to use the maximum tolerated dose of LY2157299 established in human clinical trials, 300mg delivered as 150mg P.O. BID. On day 15 patients will begin chemoradiation with either 5-FU (fluorouracil ) or capecitabine (Xeloda\u00ae). On day 29, patients will undergo another fourteen day course of LY2157299 concurrent with their ongoing chemoradiation.\n\nPatients will undergo 50.4 to 54Gy of radiation in 1.8Gy daily fractions delivered Monday through Friday for a total of 28-30 fractions. The acceptable duration of chemoradiation, including treatment breaks or delays, is up to 8 weeks total. Six to ten weeks after completing their neoadjuvant therapy, patient will undergo a tumor specific mesorectal excision as per standard of care with evaluation of pathologic response rate. Patients will be followed for disease-free survival, progression free survival, local recurrence, and overall survival. A three patient safety lead-in will be performed, where a six week safety period following completion of radiation will be completed prior to enrolling subsequent patients.",

Pirtobrutinib, a type of tyrosine kinase inhibitor, works by blocking the action of the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) protein. The BTK protein signals cancer cells to multiply, and blocking it may help keep cancer cells from growing. It could also improve T cell fitness and decrease inflammation, therefore, may improve the efficacy and safety of T cell-based therapies, such as mosunetuzumab. Mosunetuzumab is a bispecific antibody that binds both T cells and the lymphoma cancer cells and harnesses T cells to interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving pirtobrutinib and mosunetuzumab together may kill more tumor cells in patients with relapsed or refractory grade 1-3a FL and potentially decreases some side effects of mosunetuzumab which are related to T cells being activated (e.g., cytokine release syndrome).",

Abnormalities in these genes may cause the cancer to grow more rapidly. CDK4 and CDK6 are proteins that are involved with the cell growth process. D-type cyclins (CCND1, CCND2, and CCND3) are proteins that help control the activity of CDK4 and CDK6.\n\nAbemaciclib is being studied as a treatment for people with advanced cancer. Abemaciclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. CDK inhibitors work to stop cell growth. In this research study, the investigators are hoping to learn whether Abemaciclib can be used to slow or stop the growth of cancers with specific genetic abnormalities.",

Anastrozole is a standard treatment in women with breast cancer and works more effectively than tamoxifen. This study hopes to learn if anastrozole may also be effective in men. Given that gonadal suppression and CDK 4/6 inhibitors have both improved treatment in women with breast cancer, the study hopes to learn how the addition of Degarelix (gonadal suppression) and Abemaciclib (CDK 4/6 inhibitors) work in comparison to standard of care tamoxifen.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including laboratory evaluations and quality of life questionnaires.\n\nAfter completion of treatment, participants will be followed for up to 10 years\n\nIt is expected that about 60 men will take part in this research study.\n\nEli Lilly, a pharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by providing one of the study drugs.

    "brief_summary": "Alopecia areata (AA) in the acute phase with active hair shedding causes significant psychological distress, prompting the need for effective treatment. While baricitinib has shown efficacy in chronic AA with extensive hair loss (SALT \u2265 50), its impact on acute AA remains unclear. Clinical observations suggest that baricitinib can reduce or halt hair shedding within 4-6 weeks, offering a faster response than conventional treatments like systemic corticosteroids. This 16-week, single-center, open-label study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of baricitinib in 30 patients with acute AA and active shedding. Participants will receive 4 mg daily for 16 weeks, with responders tapering to 2 mg for an additional 16 weeks. Follow-up visits will occur at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 36, 44, and 52. The primary endpoint is achieving an iSARS-AA score of 20 or less at week 16. This study will provide real-world insights into baricitinib's role in managing acute AA.",
    "detailed_description": "Alopecia areata (AA) patients in the acute phase with active hair shedding experience significant psychological distress and an urgent need for effective treatment. The autoimmune nature of AA, driven by T-cell-mediated attacks on anagen hair follicles, leads to progressive hair loss. While baricitinib has been shown to promote hair regrowth in chronic AA with extensive hair loss (SALT \u2265 50), its efficacy in acute AA with active shedding has not been evaluated in BRAVE-AA1/2 trials. Clinical observations suggest that baricitinib can reduce or halt hair shedding within 4-6 weeks, offering a faster response compared to conventional treatments such as systemic corticosteroids, which often take longer or fail to achieve this outcome. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of baricitinib in patients with acute AA experiencing active shedding in a real-world setting. A 16-week, single-center, open-label, prospective trial will be conducted, enrolling 30 patients with active AA and progressive hair loss. Participants will receive 4 mg of baricitinib daily for 16 weeks, with responders tapering to 2 mg for an additional 16 weeks before discontinuation. Scheduled follow-up visits will be conducted at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 36, 44, and 52. The primary endpoint is achieving an iSARS-AA score of 20 or less at week 16. Findings from this study will provide valuable insights into the real-world effectiveness of baricitinib in managing acute AA with active hair shedding.",

    "detailed_description": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Advances in the systemic treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have increased survival in metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC. However resistance to therapy can develop.\n\nNSCLC tumors with EGFR-activating mutations are exquisitely sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors with overall response rates approximating 80%. The third generation EGFR compound osimertinib is a standard first line option. Resistance to the third generation EGFR-TKI osimertinib can develop with a median PFS of 18.9 months. Current research examining acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs has focused on overcoming these main mechanisms of EGFR-TKI resistance and understanding the impact of co-occurring alterations. Frequently altered pathways concomitantly affected with EGFR in lung cancer are cell cycle genes. This study will explore a strategy to inhibit EGFR and CDK4/6 in resistant EGFR mutated lung cancer patients post progression on osimertinib.",

    "brief_summary": "This is a prospective, non-randomized clinical trial that aims to describe the efficacy and toxicity of commercially available, targeted anticancer drugs\\* prescribed for treatment of patients with advanced cancer with a potentially actionable variant as revealed by a genomic or protein expression test. The study also aims to simplify patient access to approved targeted therapies that are contributed to the program by collaborating pharmaceutical companies and to perform next generation sequencing on tumor biopsies for biomarker analyses. Eligible patients have an advanced solid tumor, multiple myeloma or B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma for which standard treatment options are no longer available and acceptable performance status and organ function. A genomic or protein expression test must have been performed on the tumor and the results must identify at least one potentially actionable molecular variant as defined in the protocol. Results from the molecular profiling test will be used to determine an appropriate drug(s) from among those available in the protocol. The choice of drug will be supported by a list of potential profiles, a molecular tumor board, a knowledge library and by study coordinators for review and approval of the match. The protocol-specified treatment will be administered to the patient once any drug-specific eligibility criteria are confirmed and a fresh pre-treatment biopsy is performed for future genetic studies. All patients who receive treatment with a drug available in the protocol will be followed for standard efficacy outcomes including tumor response, progression-free and overall survival as well as duration of treatment. In addition, treatment related toxicity will be evaluated.",
    "detailed_description": "Problem description: evidence is building that matching targeted agents to tumor characteristics can improve outcomes. Such reports have fueled interest among patients and physicians to use molecular testing for treatment planning when standard treatment options have been exhausted. When oncologists aim to provide such personalized treatment to their patients though, obtaining the drugs can be challenging since off-label prescribing, while legal, is generally not reimbursed by insurance companies. Furthermore, outcomes of off-label treatment in routine clinical practice are not systematically recorded. As a result, the research and clinical communities have limited insight in these outcomes, leading to repetitive use of ineffective treatment for some tumor types, while effective treatment strategies might be missed for others. The latter is especially relevant for 'orphan diseases', that are too rare to conduct formal phase II and III trials. In summary, there is a lack of access to potentially effective therapy on one hand, and a lack of knowledge on broader use of such therapies on the other, altogether leading to sub-optimal use of available resources.\n\nEnvisioned solution and study aim: creation of a drug-access program, in which patients are treated with registered targeted therapy matched to their molecular tumor profile, and in which the outcomes of such therapies are recorded systematically, per tumor profile and tumor type (this is important since it is becoming increasingly clear that the tissue of origin is an important determinant of outcome of genetic abnormalities). We hereby aim to improve and broaden the use of registered targeted therapy, whilst facilitating patient access to such therapy.\n\nPlan of investigation: patients will be treated with approved targeted agents, selected based on results of a molecular profiling test of the patient's tumor. Eligible patients will have exhausted standard treatment options, and their tumor must harbor a potentially actionable molecular variant as defined in the protocol. The study will provide a tumor board to help physicians understand the profiling test results and treatment options, and will enable insights about the utility of this approach. In addition, next generation sequencing will be performed on fresh tumor biopsies for additional biomarker discovery. Patients from the Netherlands and the USA will be included in two similar though independent protocols (DRUP and TAPUR), allowing data-exchange and empowering of both trials.\n\nExpected outcome: early signs of clinical activity of approved drugs outside their label, providing effective personalized treatment options, improved patient outcomes and access to targeted therapy.",

The study will investigate if a one month drug holiday from the CDK4/6 inhibitor drug, abemaciclib, will restore the body's sensitivity to the drug and make the subsequent treatment of abemaciclib plus fulvestrant more effective.\n\nThis is a single arm study where patients will receive fulvestrant for 1 month, followed by abemaciclib and fulvestrant every 28 days.\n\nThe treatment will be administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.",

Glofitamab and obinutuzumab are monoclonal antibodies that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Obinutuzumab may also reduce the risk of immune-related conditions from treatment. Pirtobrutinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors.

To evaluate the time-to-complete response without measurable residual disease (CRMRD-).\n\nVI. To evaluate the treatment-free interval among patients who discontinue treatment following CRMRD- status.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To explore associations between baseline tumor characteristics including genetic (e.g. mutations in BTK) and immune profiles (e.g. expression of co-inhibitory receptors and T cell phenotypes) and outcomes in patients administered the combination of glofitamab and pirtobrutinib.\n\nII. To explore the effects of the combination of glofitamab and pirtobrutinib on pharmacodynamic markers relating to drug mechanism (e.g. emergence of clones with mutations conferring resistance to the study combination).\n\nIII. To estimate the quality of life of participants during therapy with glofitamab and pirtobrutinib.\n\nIV. To explore time-to-CRMRD- during therapy with glofitamab and pirtobrutinib.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1 for a total of 2 doses. Patients receive glofitamab IV on days 8 and 15 of cycle 1 and day 1 of remaining cycles. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive pirtobrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) at screening, after every 4 cycles through cycle 13 and then after every 6 cycles.

    "detailed_description": "Immunotherapeutic treatment with check-point inhibitors has increased survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that does not have any mutation to be targeted. However, the concept that tumors evade immune surveillance through a variety of mechanisms, and that activating the immune system can lead to tumor regression in a variety of tumor types has been known for decades. Thus, this study combines the effects to blocking 2 different pathways- inhibition of PD-1 pathway and angiogenic pathway via inhibition of VEGR signaling to improve survival as blocking each pathway individually has demonstrated a modest increment. There has been no study using nivolumab in combination with a VEGFR2 inhibitor, a drug which has both anti-angiogenic and pleotropic immunomodulatory effects and may synergize with the effect of an anti-PD-1 agent, in solid tumors. Activating the anti-tumor effects of T cells by utilizing multiple pathways of both nivolumab and ramucirumab is an endeavor which merits investigation.\n\nThus, the study investigates the synergistic effect of targeted anti-antitumor activity of immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab and immune-suppressive activity of VEGF-inhibitor ramicirumab expecting a favorable overall survival in NSCLC patients, with the additional benefit of tolerable toxicities.",

    "brief_summary": "As stated by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the Socie\u0301te\u0301 Franc\u0327aise de Rhumatologie (SFR), treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) should target sustained remission or at least low disease activity. However, despite significant advances based on various combinations of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologic DMARDs, RA therapies meet treatment goals only in some patients:\n\n* 40 to 50% of patients with early RA, treated with methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy as first-line therapy,\n* 20 to 30% of patients treated with a combination of MTX and biologic as second-line therapy.\n* Less than 10% of patients treated with a combination of MTX and another targeted DMARD, such as baricitinib, as third-line therapy.\n\nTherefore, new strategies targeted at achieving a higher percentage of remission are needed, that do not require waiting for multiple failed therapies. Combinations of biologics have shown synergistic improvement of symptoms in murine models of RA relative to the improvement observed with either agent alone. However, in RA patients, only five randomised clinical trials (RCTs) have explored the efficacy and safety of combining tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor with another biologic (anakinra, abatacept, rituximab or bimekizumab).\n\nBaricitinib is a selective, reversible and competitive inhibitor of Janus kinases (Jaki). This treatment is efficient in a number of therapeutic scenarios in RA and showed a clinical superiority over adalimumab in one RCT (RA-BEAM study in MTX inadequate responders). Of note, baricitinib inhibits many of the pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of RA but does not block signalling downstream of TNF. Owing to the interest in combining different mechanisms of action, the investigators plan to assess the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with baricitinib and a TNF inhibitor. The investigators are aware that combining targeted therapies is not recommended due to a potential increase in the frequency of serious adverse events. However, several case series on patients treated with a combination of targeted therapies have been published, suggesting a certain efficacy in patients with refractory RA. The first ones focused on inflammatory bowel diseases and psoriasis, but more recently, combination of tofacitinib (which belongs to the same Jaki family as baricitinib) with various biologics has been reported in a sample of RA patients. No serious adverse effects were reported over a mean of approximately 11 months of therapy. The clinical improvement was mild but noticeable in these refractory RA cases.\n\nRecently, data of interest from the RA-BEAM study have been reported. Patients who switched from adalimumab to baricitinib showed improvements in disease control. Because the switch from adalimumab to baricitinib occurred without a washout period, and because adalimumab has a mean circulating half-life of approximately 14 days, patients would have received several weeks of dual TNF and Jak1/Jak2 inhibition in the course of the change of treatment. The observation of increased efficacy, with no apparent acute safety issues during the weeks when patients were exposed to both adalimumab and baricitinib, is of interest, and supports our strategy to combine the two treatments for patients with refractory RA.\n\nThe investigators consider that there is a need for investigation into the addition of anti-TNF to baricitinib in patients suffering of refractory RA (inadequate response to TNF inhibitors). The investigators hypothesize that in this population, based on ACR50 score, this combination therapy will decrease disease activity more efficiently than a switch to another targeted DMARD, such as baricitinib.",
    "detailed_description": "Intensive combination therapies have revolutionised the management of solid neoplasms, hematologic malignancies, and acquired-immune-deficiency syndrome. These intensive strategies are based on the need to obtain rapid control of disease activity to afford the chance of stable full remission and avoid irreversible complications. The same goal applies to management of RA. Because current therapeutic strategies may fall short of these target goals and fail to improve quality of life in some patients, novel approaches are needed to improve outcomes. RA is a complex disease involving numerous cell types and inflammatory mediators of innate and adaptive immune systems. The investigators are aware that most of combination bDMARD strategies have been associated with little or no incremental benefit in efficacy compared to single-biologic therapy. However, our study will target mechanisms that differ from those in previous studies. Strategies that simultaneously target different pathways involved in the pathogenesis of RA may enhance treatment responses in patients with RA. Of note, baricitinib does not directly block signalling downstream of TNF, even if an indirect effect on TNF production is likely to occur. Targeting multiple inflammatory cytokines in combination may lead to more effective treatment and enhanced clinical responses in patients with RA compared to the current second-line strategies. The different mechanisms of action of baricitinib and anti-TNF, should ensure the efficacy of the combination. No concurrent trial evaluating similar strategies is registered at ClinicalTrial.gov.",

    "brief_summary": "Obesity, affecting 40% of US adults and costing 173b annually, represents a significant health care burden (1). It is associated with increased risk for multiple chronic diseases including hypertension, type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease, and NAFLD, as well as cancer, osteoarthritis, and obstructive sleep apnea. The investigators plan to test the hypothesis that tirzepatide, a dual GLP/GIP agonist, improves metabolic health (insulin resistance and regional fat distribution and cardiovascular risk profile) not only by inducing weight loss via GLP1-agonism, but also via beneficial cellular and molecular changes in adipose tissue, given that GIP binds receptors in human fat cells. Based on studies in mice showing that GIP alone or tirzepitide treatment decreases inflammation, increases lipid buffering (fat storage in the fat cells instead of releasing it into the bloodstream), and improves glucose homeostasis. The investigators believe that the GIP component of tirzepatide will make fat cells healthier and reverse lipotoxicity, which is one of the mechanisms by which obesity leads to insulin resistance, disordered regional fat distribution, and type 2 diabetes. To date, the effect of dual GLP1 and GIP agonist treatment on adipose tissue has not been evaluated in humans. Given the existing but limited data, dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist treatment in obese humans with metabolic risk factors is an attractive pharmacologic candidate that would lead to both weight loss and healthier fat, potentially offering uniquely powerful synergistic clinical benefits. It is thus of tremendous importance to define the biological effects of dual-agonist treatment on human adipose tissue structure and function, as well as related improvements in regional fat distribution and systemic adipose and muscle insulin sensitivity. In this study, the investigators will randomize overweight (with risk factors) or obese nondiabetic individuals to hypocaloric diet or tirzepatide for 22 weeks with matched weight loss for the first 6 weeks. The investigators will quantify insulin resistance, fat and lean mass, including regional fat distribution, and changes in adipose tissue (needle biopsy from abdominal fat tissue) to see if tirzepatide effects differ from dietary weight loss.",
    "detailed_description": "All participants will come to the Stanford University campus for their baseline, week 6, and week 22 (end of study) tests. Prior to starting the assigned intervention, all participants will undergo a supervised (by study dietitian) week of weight maintenance, followed by baseline tests including insulin resistance test (SSPG), Standardized Meal Tolerance Test (for hormone and metabolite profiles), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), DXA and MRI scans (to quantify total, regional, and intrahepatic fat), and a subcutaneous periumbilical adipose tissue needle biopsy. Following baseline testing, participants begin tirzepatide vs diet. weight loss will be aggressive for the first six weeks with diet to match the tirzepatide weight loss that is expected. After week 6 weight loss will occur naturally on both without matching. Patients will see the dietitian and coordinator every two weeks to review diet and physical activity, and evaluate tolerability/side effects, and obtain morning weight at Stanford. The metabolic tests, regional fat scans, and biopsy will be repeated at week 6 and week 22.",

Specifically, the protocol will allow the investigators to determine whether the main site of action of this novel and recently-approved class of migraine prophylactic drugs act inside or outside the brain and if so, where.",
    "detailed_description": "A brief overview of the study: To test the working hypothesis of the study, the investigators propose to study 60 chronic migraine (CM)/high-frequency episodic migraine (HFEM) patients in 4 visits to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) Comprehensive Headache Center and 2 visits to the imaging center at McLean Hospital. The first 3 visits to BIDMC Comprehensive Headache Center and the first visit to McLean Hospital will take place before treatment, whereas the 4th visit to BIDMC Comprehensive Headache Center and the second visit to McLean Hospital will take place 3 months after initiation of treatment. In these visits, the investigators will collect medical and headache history, perform a physical examination, administer and review subjects' e-diary, and perform functional and structural fMRI brain imaging (see flow chart).\n\nOverall study design: Experimental prospective study involving identification of neurological effects after treatment of CM and HFEM with galcanezumab - an anti-CGRP-monoclonal antibody (mAb).\n\nDesign methodologies: Open-label treatment study comparing the effects of galcanezumab on neurological functioning and brain structure in super-responders, responders and non-responders among CM and HFEM patients.\n\nPrimary goal: To determine whether galacanezumab - a drug that acts mainly outside the brain - reverses abnormal brain functioning in CM and HFEM patients. For this study, signs of abnormal brain functioning include triggering of migraine by deviation from homeostasis (prodromes, sleep deprivation, skipping meals) and abnormal sensitivity to sensory stimuli (light, noise, smell, auras).\n\nKey details of study implementation: The study includes CM and HFEM patients. The intervention is galacanezumab (Emgality\u2122). Galcanezumab is an anti-CGRP-mAb approved by the FDA for the prophylactic treatment of migraine. Because this is not an efficacy study, the primary endpoint will not include reduction in number of migraine/headache days per month. Rather, the primary endpoints of the study will include the following: incidence of prodromes, incidence of triggers, sensitivity to light, noise and smell during and in between attacks, and incidence of aura (as determined by filling the e-diary), gray mater thickness and connectivity strength between brain areas involved in migraine (as determined by fMRI). Each patient will be scheduled to visit the headache clinic at BIDMC 4 times and the McLean Hospital Pain Imaging Center twice (a total of 6 hospital visits). Visits 1 and 6 (at BIDMC) will take 1 hour. Visits 2 and 4 (at BIDMC) will take 30 min. Visits 3 and 5 (at McLean Hospital) will take 2 hours. In addition, each patient will have to fill a daily diary for 4 months (estimated to take 5 minutes per day), and will receive a 5 minute weekly phone call from a study coordinator.\n\nParticipants will undergo the following procedures:\n\n1. Medical and Headache history at BIDMC (questionnaire filled by patients and reviewed by Drs. Ashina and Burstein)\n2. Physical examination including measurements of vital signs at BIDMC (performed by Dr. Ashina).\n3. E-diary education and administration by study coordinator.\n\n   a. The diary e-diary will be administered in the form of a REDCap survey using an email link that participants can access from their personal computer/electronic device.\n4. 2 fMRI sessions at McLean Hospital by Dr. Borsook (see attached protocol from Dr. Borsook at McLean Hospital)\n5. Administration of galcanezumab by Dr. Ashina at BIDMC.\n6. Self administration of galcanezumab at home\n\nMcLean Hospital part of the study: Patients recruited to the study at BIDMC and deemed eligible to participate in the study (per the results of visits 1 and 2), will be referred to McLean Hospital for the fMRI scanning. All fMRI scanning will take place at McLean Hospital under the supervision of our Co-investigator Dr. David Borsook. Subjects will travel to McLean Hospital and be met by the research coordinator at McLean, Jaymin Upadhyay, to escort them to the MRI scanning area. The McLean MRI staff will review the subject's MRI safety checklist and prep the subjects for scanning.Each patient will be scanned twice, once before initiation of treatment with galcanezumab and a second time on day 115 of the study, after being on galcanezumab for about 3 months. Image acquisition will be performed with a Siemens Systems 3 Tesla MRI scanner equipped with a 32-channel head coil. For each patient, a high-resolution, T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence will be acquired \\[slices = 176, field of view = 220 x 220, echo time = 1.74, repetition time = 2520, flip angle = 7\u00b0, resolution = 1 x 1 mm, slice thickness = 1 mm, no gap\\]. Preprocessing for the surface-based morphometric analysis will be performed using FreeSurfer (version 5.3.0) (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu), a semi-automated toolbox for cortical surface reconstruction and visualization Affine registration of the T1-weighted volume to Talairach space is then performed, followed by skull stripping, white matter (WM) segmentation and tessellation of the gray/white matter boundary. Visual inspection and manual correction of topological errors are carried out at each processing step. Following reconstruction of the cortical surface, brains will be inflated, averaged across patients to produce a study-specific brain, and then smoothed using a 10 mm full-width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. Each hemisphere will be parcellated into 34 distinct regions using the Desikan-Killiany atlas. A direct measure of cortical thickness will then be calculated using the shortest distance (mm) between the pial surface and gray-white matter boundary at each point or vertex of the cortical mantle.",

Abemaciclib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It is highly selective inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6, which are proteins involved in cell differentiation and growth. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. Radioligand therapy uses a small molecule (in this case 177Lu-PSMA-617), which carries a radioactive component to destroys tumor cells. When 177Lu-PSMA-617 is injected into the body, it attaches to the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) receptor found on tumor cells. After 177Lu-PSMA-617 attaches to the PSMA receptor, its radiation component destroys the tumor cell. Giving abemaciclib before 177Lu-PSMA-617 may help 177Lu-PSMA-617 kill more tumor cells.",

Radioactive drugs, such as 177-Lutetium-PSMA, may carry radiation directly to tumor cells and not harm normal cells. SBRT uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving 177-Lutetium-PSMA before SBRT may make the SBRT more effective.",
    "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess progression-free survival for men with oligorecurrent prostate cancer after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) versus SBRT plus neoadjuvant lutetium Lu-177 PNT2002 (177Lu-PNT2002), with progression defined on the basis of prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (PSMA PET/CT) scans obtained at standard intervals (12 months and 24 months post-SBRT) or at the time of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based biochemical progression, or initiation of salvage therapy or death.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate disease burden of disease (including local control of irradiated lesions and presence of other disease) on a PSMA PET/CT obtained 24 months after SBRT of SBRT versus SBRT + 177Lu-PNT2002 in patients with oligometastatic disease who have not progressed by that point.\n\nII. To assess physician-scored toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 \\[CTCAE v 5.0\\]) of SBRT versus SBRT + 177Lu-PNT2002 in patients with oligometastatic disease.\n\nIII. To assess patient-reported quality of life (based on the brief pain inventory scale) after SBRT versus SBRT + 177Lu-PNT2002 in patients with oligometastatic disease.\n\nIV. To assess androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-free survival after SBRT versus SBRT + 177Lu-PNT2002 in patients with oligometastatic disease.\n\nV. To determine local control of irradiated lesion at 12 months after SBRT versus SBRT + 177Lu-PNT2002 in patients with oligometastatic disease (based on a scheduled PSMA-PET).\n\nVI. To assess time to locoregional progression, time to distant progression, time to new metastasis, and duration of response after SBRT versus SBRT + 177Lu-PNT2002 in patients with oligometastatic disease (based on standard of care imaging).\n\nCORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To enumerate circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after SBRT.\n\nII. To quantitatively sequence T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires using peripheral blood monocytes at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after SBRT.\n\nIII. To perform radiomics analysis on PSMA PET/CT scans performed at +12 months (mo.), +24 months post-SBRT, or at time of progression.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM 1: Beginning on day 1, patients undergo SBRT to all lesions for 1, 3, or 5 treatment doses (fractions) over the span of 10-20 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM 2: Patients receive 177Lu-PNT2002 intravenously (IV) over 1-10 minutes on days -112 and -56 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on day 1, patients then undergo SBRT to all lesions for 1, 3, or 5 treatment doses (fractions) over the span of 10-20 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, then every 6 months until 60 months of total follow-up.",

Tepotinib is used in patients whose cancer has a mutated (changed) form of a gene called MET. It is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of the abnormal MET protein that signals tumor cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of tumor cells. Ramucirumab is a monoclonal antibody that may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Giving tepotinib with ramucirumab may lower the chance of the cancer from growing or spreading in patients with stage IV or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.",

    "detailed_description": "This is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials evaluate whether investigational drugs are effective against a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drugs are being studied.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved abemaciclib or letrozole for your specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.\n\nThe FDA has approved metformin for diabetes but is considered investigational for its use in cancer.\n\nThe FDA has not approved zotatifin as a treatment for any disease.\n\nAbemaciclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. CDK inhibitors work to stop cancer cell growth. Letrozole is a hormonal therapy that works by lowering the production of estrogen in your body. Estrogen may help to stimulate cancer cells to grow, so lowering the levels of estrogen in your body may work to slow cancer cell growth. Metformin is an antihyperglycemic drug most commonly used to lower the amount of blood sugar in the blood and increase the body's sensitivity to insulin. Metformin also works on cancer cells to stop cancer cell growth and promote cancer cell death. Zotatifin is a selective eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) inhibitor. Selective eIF4A inhibition works by stopping cancer cell growth and enhancing CDK inhibition. In this research study, we are hoping to learn whether the combination of abemaciclib and letrozole alone, with metformin, or with zotatifin is effective at slowing or stopping endometrial and/or ovarian cancer cell growth.",

    "detailed_description": "The WSG ADAPT trial program is one of the first new generation trials addressing the issue of individualization of (neo)-adjuvant decision-making in early breast cancer (EBC) in a subtype-specific manner. The first WSG ADAPT umbrella trial (NCT01779206) aimed to establish early predictive molecular surrogate markers for response after a short 3-week induction treatment.\n\nThe goals of the WSG ADAPT trial program - early response assessment and subtype-specific therapy tailoring to those patients who are most likely to benefit - have contributed to the positive national and international feedback regarding the ADAPT-concept as a whole.\n\nThe aim of this ADAPTlate phase-III-trial is to gain further knowledge of the group of patients at intermediate to high risk for disease recurrence, who have completed definite locoregional therapy (with or without neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy). With ADAPTlate it is planned to investigate if the intermediate to high-risk patient group identified during the screening phase derives additional benefit from treatment with abemaciclib in combination with ET compared to ET alone.",

The current medical management of osteoporosis (or the care gap in diagnosis and treatment) will be measured using this questionnaire at phase 2. Once the phase 2 questionnaire has been completed, Only participants with fragility fractures will be randomized to one of the three following educational intervention groups: 1) the Educational Video Group, 2) the Documentation Group, or 3) the Control Group.\n\nAt phase 3, 12 to 14 months after randomization, the effectiveness of the interventions will be assessed by re-administering the questionnaires to participants who experienced a fragility fracture at baseline. The questionnaires evaluate the status of diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis, modifiable risk factors and the health-related quality of life (EQ-5D). The impact of the interventions on the participants will be assessed by comparing diagnosis and treatments rates in each intervention arm.\n\nIf the long-term viability of the programme is secured, participants with fragility and traumatic fractures will be followed for a maximum period of 20 years using specific encoded personal data contained in the RAMQ and Quebec's drug plan databases.",

    "detailed_description": "This study will recruit participants from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) observational study, a multicenter international study supported by the National Institutes of Health (Grant Number U01-AG032438; RJ Bateman), Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trial Units (DIAN-TU) sites, DIAN-TU partner sites, DIAN Expanded Registry (DIAN-EXR), and families identified by the sites. As part of the DIAN-TU-001 protocol, participants undergo longitudinal assessments that include clinical assessment, cognitive testing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and analysis of blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n\nParticipants in DIAN are recruited from families that have at least one member who has been identified as having a mutation linked to dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD). The mutations in presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) that are associated with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease have very high penetrance (near 100%). This study enrolls individuals who are either known to have a disease-causing mutation or who are at risk for such a mutation (the descendant or sibling of a proband with a known mutation) and unaware of their genetic status. Because the age at onset of cognitive changes is relatively consistent within each family and with each mutation, an age at onset is determined for each affected parent or mutation as part of the DIAN Observational (DIAN-OBS) study protocol. This study will enroll participants who are either asymptomatic and are within a specific window of time of expected age at onset for their family and/or mutation or who have symptoms of mild Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe ability to identify individuals destined to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) and predict the age of onset with a high degree of confidence provides a unique opportunity to assess the efficacy of therapies at asymptomatic and very early stages of dementia. Families with known disease-causing mutations are extremely rare and are geographically dispersed throughout the world. These constraints necessitate a specialized study design. Many of the participants in this study will not yet have any cognitive symptoms of AD; they will be \"asymptomatic\" carriers of mutations that cause dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease and would be expected to perform normally on standard cognitive and functional testing. Imaging and fluid biomarkers will be used to demonstrate that the treatment compounds have engaged their therapeutic targets. A set of cognitive measures designed to assess the very earliest and most subtle cognitive changes will be collected. Additionally, because many at-risk individuals decide not to know whether they have the disease-associated mutation or not, when allowable in individual drug arms, some of the at-risk individuals enrolled in this study will not have the disease-causing mutations; they will be \"mutation negative\". It is important to enroll these participants to avoid coercion (e.g., potential participants may be pressured into genetic testing to learn their genetic status in order to be eligible for the trial) unless the drug-specific design includes open-label treatment. These mutation negative individuals will be assigned to the placebo group and data will be used to determine normal ranges of outcome measures. Participants and site study staff will remain blinded as to these individuals' active or placebo group assignment and mutation status. Thus, the study will be double-blinded for placebo and for mutation status, except for mutation positive participants who are aware of their genetic status. There may be exceptional circumstances when required by local regulation or health authorities where enrollment may be restricted to mutation carriers only, but such mandates will be thoroughly documented and agreed upon by the governing regulatory agency and sponsor.\n\nThis is an adaptive platform-based study. Several different therapies (each referred to as a study drug arm) will be tested in order to increase the likelihood that an effective treatment will be discovered. The compounds are selected for this trial based on mechanism of action and available data on efficacy and safety profile. The study design includes a pooled placebo group (referred to as the mutation positive placebos) which may be shared by study drug arms. Mutation positive participants will be assigned to a study drug arm and subsequently randomized within that arm to the active drug to placebo ratio specified in each drug-specific appendix. When included in individual drug arms, mutation negative participants will all receive placebo treatment. Participants and study staff will not be blinded as to which study drug arm each participant has been assigned; they will be blinded as to whether participants have been randomized to active drug or placebo.\n\nBiomarker, cognitive, and/or clinical endpoints will be specified for each study drug arm. Biomarker data will be analyzed for pre-specified endpoints consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and other AD biomarker outcomes.\n\nInterim analyses of the imaging or fluid biomarker endpoint will assess safety and whether each study drug engages its biological targets. The clinical and cognitive assessments are designed to assess subtle cognitive changes that may be detectable before the onset of dementia as well as cognitive and clinical decline in symptomatic groups.\n\nAfter the last participant in a study drug arm completes the 4-year treatment period, participants in that study drug arm may be eligible to receive active study drug in an open-label extension period.\n\nA cognitive run-in (CRI) period was implemented to allow for enrollment during periods when study drug arms are not randomizing. This enables the DIAN-TU platform to have continuous enrollment during periods before or in-between drug arm randomization.\n\nThe CRI period of cognitive, clinical, and imaging data collection was designed as part of the platform study to utilize the time in between enrollment of study drug arms. The CRI period will enhance study enrollment by identifying eligible participants and engaging them with the cognitive assessments and can reduce practice effects by allowing participants to habituate to the testing process. The CRI further provides important baseline and run-in data that adds control data to the platform and informs about the effects of tested drugs. The data collected in the CRI period will be used for analysis in the respective drug arm under which participants are randomized and treated.\n\nSolanezumab and gantenerumab double blind treatment arms: Primary Completion Date= Nov 2019 and Study Completion= March 2020 (NCT04623242)\n\nGantenerumab open-label extension was discontinued based on findings from an interim efficacy analysis and the status of the drug program.

This study will also investigate the effects of remternetug on biomarkers (measures of the disease including brain scans, blood and spinal fluid tests), examine safety data to identify any potential benefits or risks, and examine how well participants can tolerate remternetug.\n\nStage 1 will determine if treatment with the study drug prevents or reverses amyloid beta (A\u03b2) accumulation compared with placebo in participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD).\n\nStage 2 will evaluate the effect of early anti-amyloid treatment on downstream biomarkers of AD in treated participants compared to external control groups.",
    "detailed_description": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive decline in cognitive function and the ability to perform activities of daily living. The amyloid hypothesis of AD postulates that the accumulation of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) is an early and necessary event in the pathogenesis of AD. This hypothesis suggests that interventions that slow the accumulation of A\u03b2 plaque in the brain or increase clearance of A\u03b2 may be able to slow the progression of the AD clinical syndrome. AD occurs on a continuum from asymptomatic (preclinical) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and then to dementia in mild, moderate, and severe stages. Evidence from both genetic at-risk and age at-risk cohorts, such as in dominantly inherited AD (DIAD) suggests that the pathophysiological process of AD begins well more than a decade before the clinical stage now recognized as AD dementia, and that neurodegeneration is already apparent on MRI by the stage of mild cognitive impairment. Recent clinical trial data suggest that treating AD during the earlier stages could have the greatest potential benefit on the disease by slowing progression\n\nThe ability to identify individuals destined to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) with a high degree of confidence provides a unique opportunity to assess the efficacy of therapies at asymptomatic and very early stages of dementia. Families with known disease-causing mutations are extremely rare and are geographically dispersed throughout the world.\n\nParticipants in this study will not yet have developed any clinical symptoms of AD; they will be \"asymptomatic\" carriers of mutations that cause DIAD and would be expected to perform normally on standard cognitive and functional testing. Further, most mutation carriers will have levels of AD-associated amyloid beta (A\u03b2) and non-A\u03b2 biomarkers that are the same as non-carriers.\n\nAmyloid beta is a protein that accumulates in the brain of people with AD. Although we do not understand exactly what causes AD, the abnormal accumulation of amyloid beta protein in the brain is thought to play an important role in the symptoms of AD. Recent research studies indicate that amyloid beta may start building up in the brain 15 years or more before the onset of memory loss.\n\nImaging and fluid biomarkers will be used to demonstrate that the treatment compounds have engaged their therapeutic targets. A set of cognitive measures designed to assess the very earliest and most subtle cognitive changes will be collected. The overall objectives of this study are to evaluate the biomarker effect, safety, and tolerability of investigational study drugs in participants who are known to have an AD-causing mutation.\n\nThe primary objective of Stage 1 is to determine if treatment with the study drug prevents or slows the rate of A\u03b2 pathological disease accumulation demonstrated by A\u03b2 PiB positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.\n\nThe primary objective of Stage 2 is to evaluate the effect of early anti-amyloid treatment on disease progression by assessing downstream non-A\u03b2 biomarkers of AD (e.g., CSF total tau, NfL, MRI volume) compared to a control group from the DIAN Obs natural history study and the DIAN-TU-001 placebo-treated participants.\n\nRemternetug is a monoclonal antibody. The mechanism of action of remternetug is to target and remove aggregated amyloid plaque, a key pathological hallmark of AD, via microglial-mediated clearance. Remternetug has demonstrated the ability to reduce brain amyloid plaque.\n\nThe remternetug arm is part of Master Protocol DIAN-TU-002 (NCT05552157)",
