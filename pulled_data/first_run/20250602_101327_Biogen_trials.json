    "brief_summary": "In this study, researchers will learn more about a study drug called litifilimab (BIIB059) in participants with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). The study will focus on participants who have either active subacute CLE or chronic CLE, or both. They may also have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The participants did not respond to antimalarial therapy or had problems with the treatment that made it hard to continue.\n\nThe main objective of the study is to learn about the effect litifilimab has on lowering the activity of the skin disease. Researchers will measure symptoms of CLE over time using a variety of scoring tools. These include the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI), the Cutaneous Lupus Activity of Investigator's Global Assessment-Revised (CLA-IGA-R), and the SELENA-SLEDAI Flare Index (SFI).\n\nThe main questions researchers want to answer are:\n\n* How many participants have a score of 0 or 1 on the CLA-IGA-R looking at skin redness after treatment?\n* How many participants have their skin disease activity go down by at least 70%?\n\nResearchers will also learn more about the safety of litifilimab. They will study how participants' immune systems respond to litifilimab. Additionally, they will measure the effect litifilimab and CLE have on the quality of life of participants using a group of questionnaires.\n\nThe study will be split into 2 parts - Part A and Part B. Both parts will be done as follows:\n\n* After screening, participants will be randomized to receive either litifilimab or placebo for the 1st treatment period. A placebo looks like the study drug but contains no real medicine.\n* Participants will receive either litifilimab or placebo as injections under the skin once every 4 weeks.\n* The 1st treatment period will be double blinded which means neither the researchers nor the participants will know if the participants are receiving litifilimab or placebo.\n* This double blinded treatment period will last 24 weeks, after which the 2nd treatment period will begin.\n* During the 2nd treatment period, all participants will receive litifilimab for 28 weeks.\n* After completing treatment in this study, participants that qualify will be given the choice to join the Long-Term Extension study, 230LE305. If they do not, they will move into a follow-up safety period that will last up to 24 weeks.\n* The total study duration for participants will be up to 80 weeks",

Currently, ongoing studies utilize pre-filled syringes (PFS) that can deliver litifilimab subcutaneously (SC), also known as under the skin.\n\nIn this study, researchers want to learn more about new ways of delivering litifilimab SC using either an autoinjector (AI) or an on-body injector (OBI):\n\nBoth devices are designed to deliver litifilimab in an automatic way, especially helping patients who may not be able to use their hands very well, or who may be afraid of needles. While the AI is handheld, the OBI device works by being placed on the skin and can help deliver the highest amount of litifilimab through a single injection. The main objective of this study is to learn how the body processes litifilimab after using the AI device or the OBI device, as compared to using the PFS method.\n\nThe main questions researchers want to answer are:\n\n* What is the highest amount of litifilimab found in the blood after dosing? How much total litifilimab is found in the blood throughout the study? Researchers will also learn more about: Any medical problems the participants have during the study\n* Any injection site pain or reactions the participants may have. Any skin reactions to the OBI device\n* Any changes in the participants' overall health after receiving litifilimab.\n\nThis study will be done as follows:\n\n* Participants will be screened to check if they can join the study.

    "brief_summary": "In this study, researchers will learn more about the use of felzartamab in people with active lupus nephritis, also known as LN. In people with LN, antibodies build up in the glomeruli of the kidneys. Antibodies are proteins in the blood used by the immune system to fight infection. Glomeruli are small filters that remove waste and extra fluid from the blood. This buildup leads to inflammation and damage to the kidneys.\n\nKidney damage can lead to too much protein and blood leaking into the urine. High levels of protein in the urine, called proteinuria, are common in people with LN. Symptoms of LN can include fever, swelling in the legs and body, and high blood pressure. If left untreated, LN can eventually lead to kidney failure.\n\nIn this study, researchers will learn more about how a study drug called felzartamab affects people with LN. Felzartamab is a monoclonal antibody, which means it is an antibody made in a laboratory. Felzartamab can target immune cells that produce antibodies, helping to lower their buildup in the kidneys. The main goal of this study is to learn more about the safety of felzartamab and how it works in the body of people with LN who are taking standard of care. This will help researchers decide if they should do more studies with felzartamab in people with LN. Standard of care is the usual treatment or care given to patients for a disease, as prescribed by their doctor.\n\nThe main question researchers want to answer in this study are:\n\n\u2022 How many participants had adverse events during the study? An adverse event is a health problem that may or may not be caused by the study drug. It can happen during a clinical study or within a certain amount of time after the study has ended.\n\nResearchers will also learn more about:\n\n* How much felzartamab affects proteinuria and the level of creatinine in the urine. Creatinine is a protein that is released into the blood from normal muscle wear and tear. Its levels can help doctors understand how well your kidneys are working.\n* How many participants have a complete response. A complete response means that their urine protein levels decrease to a low level, and their kidney function stays stable.\n* How many participants have a 50% decrease in the level of protein and creatinine in their urine.\n* How much felzartamab affects the participants' lupus-related blood tests.\n* How the body processes felzartamab.\n* How many participants develop antibodies against felzartamab in the blood.\n\nThis study will be done as follows:\n\n* Participants will be screened to check if they can join the study. The screening period will be up to 42 days.\n* Throughout the study, all participants will continue taking their standard of care, as prescribed by their doctor.\n* There are 2 parts in this study. In both parts, participants will receive felzartamab through an intravenous infusion, also known as an IV. This means it is being given into a vein.\n* In Part 1, participants will have up to 14 visits to their study research center. In Part 2, participants may have up to 15 visits.\n* Each participant will be in the study for about 2 years.",

The causative mutation is a trinucleotide (GAA) repeat expansion in the first intron of the frataxin gene, leading to impaired transcription of frataxin. The pathological consequences of frataxin deficiency include a severe disruption of iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, mitochondrial iron overload coupled to cellular iron dysregulation, and an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress.\n\nA hallmark of Friedreich's ataxia is impairment of antioxidative defense mechanisms, which play a major role in disease progression. Studies have demonstrated that nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling is grossly impaired in participants with Friedreich's ataxia. Therefore, the ability of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) to activate Nrf2 and induce antioxidant target genes is hypothesized to be therapeutic in participants with Friedreich's ataxia.\n\nThis 2-part study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) in the treatment of participants with Friedreich's ataxia.\n\nPart 1: The first part of this study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) at various doses in participants with Friedreich's ataxia.\n\nPart 2: The second part of this study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) 150 mg in participants with Friedreich's ataxia. Participants enrolled in Part 2 will be randomized 1:1 to receive omaveloxolone (RTA 408) 150 mg or placebo.\n\nExtension: The extension will assess long-term safety and tolerability of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) in qualified participants with Friedreich's ataxia following completion of Part 1 or Part 2. Participants will not be unblinded to study treatment in Part 1 or Part 2 upon entering the extension study. Participants will receive open-label omaveloxolone (RTA 408) at 150 mg once daily.",

    "brief_summary": "As stated by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the Socie\u0301te\u0301 Franc\u0327aise de Rhumatologie (SFR), treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) should target sustained remission or at least low disease activity. However, despite significant advances based on various combinations of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologic DMARDs, RA therapies meet treatment goals only in some patients:\n\n* 40 to 50% of patients with early RA, treated with methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy as first-line therapy,\n* 20 to 30% of patients treated with a combination of MTX and biologic as second-line therapy.\n* Less than 10% of patients treated with a combination of MTX and another targeted DMARD, such as baricitinib, as third-line therapy.\n\nTherefore, new strategies targeted at achieving a higher percentage of remission are needed, that do not require waiting for multiple failed therapies. Combinations of biologics have shown synergistic improvement of symptoms in murine models of RA relative to the improvement observed with either agent alone. However, in RA patients, only five randomised clinical trials (RCTs) have explored the efficacy and safety of combining tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor with another biologic (anakinra, abatacept, rituximab or bimekizumab).\n\nBaricitinib is a selective, reversible and competitive inhibitor of Janus kinases (Jaki). This treatment is efficient in a number of therapeutic scenarios in RA and showed a clinical superiority over adalimumab in one RCT (RA-BEAM study in MTX inadequate responders). Of note, baricitinib inhibits many of the pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of RA but does not block signalling downstream of TNF. Owing to the interest in combining different mechanisms of action, the investigators plan to assess the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with baricitinib and a TNF inhibitor. The investigators are aware that combining targeted therapies is not recommended due to a potential increase in the frequency of serious adverse events. However, several case series on patients treated with a combination of targeted therapies have been published, suggesting a certain efficacy in patients with refractory RA. The first ones focused on inflammatory bowel diseases and psoriasis, but more recently, combination of tofacitinib (which belongs to the same Jaki family as baricitinib) with various biologics has been reported in a sample of RA patients. No serious adverse effects were reported over a mean of approximately 11 months of therapy. The clinical improvement was mild but noticeable in these refractory RA cases.\n\nRecently, data of interest from the RA-BEAM study have been reported. Patients who switched from adalimumab to baricitinib showed improvements in disease control. Because the switch from adalimumab to baricitinib occurred without a washout period, and because adalimumab has a mean circulating half-life of approximately 14 days, patients would have received several weeks of dual TNF and Jak1/Jak2 inhibition in the course of the change of treatment. The observation of increased efficacy, with no apparent acute safety issues during the weeks when patients were exposed to both adalimumab and baricitinib, is of interest, and supports our strategy to combine the two treatments for patients with refractory RA.\n\nThe investigators consider that there is a need for investigation into the addition of anti-TNF to baricitinib in patients suffering of refractory RA (inadequate response to TNF inhibitors). The investigators hypothesize that in this population, based on ACR50 score, this combination therapy will decrease disease activity more efficiently than a switch to another targeted DMARD, such as baricitinib.",
    "detailed_description": "Intensive combination therapies have revolutionised the management of solid neoplasms, hematologic malignancies, and acquired-immune-deficiency syndrome. These intensive strategies are based on the need to obtain rapid control of disease activity to afford the chance of stable full remission and avoid irreversible complications. The same goal applies to management of RA. Because current therapeutic strategies may fall short of these target goals and fail to improve quality of life in some patients, novel approaches are needed to improve outcomes. RA is a complex disease involving numerous cell types and inflammatory mediators of innate and adaptive immune systems. The investigators are aware that most of combination bDMARD strategies have been associated with little or no incremental benefit in efficacy compared to single-biologic therapy. However, our study will target mechanisms that differ from those in previous studies. Strategies that simultaneously target different pathways involved in the pathogenesis of RA may enhance treatment responses in patients with RA. Of note, baricitinib does not directly block signalling downstream of TNF, even if an indirect effect on TNF production is likely to occur. Targeting multiple inflammatory cytokines in combination may lead to more effective treatment and enhanced clinical responses in patients with RA compared to the current second-line strategies. The different mechanisms of action of baricitinib and anti-TNF, should ensure the efficacy of the combination. No concurrent trial evaluating similar strategies is registered at ClinicalTrial.gov.",

    "brief_summary": "In this study, researchers will learn more about the use of felzartamab in participants with primary membranous nephropathy, also known as PMN. In people with PMN, autoantibodies build up in the glomeruli of the kidney. Antibodies are proteins that help the body fight off infection. An autoantibody is a type of antibody that mistakenly targets and attacks the body's own tissues. Glomeruli are the filters of the kidney that remove waste and extra fluid from the body. In PMN, the build-up of autoantibodies in the glomeruli causes damage to the kidneys.\n\nKidney damage can lead to too much protein and blood leaking into the urine. High levels of protein in the urine, called proteinuria, are common in people with PMN. Symptoms of PMN can include swelling in the legs and body, tiredness, and high blood pressure. If left untreated, PMN can eventually lead to kidney failure.\n\nIn this study, researchers will learn more about how a study drug called felzartamab affects people with PMN. Felzartamab is a monoclonal antibody, which means it is an antibody made in a laboratory. Felzartamab can target immune cells that produce autoantibodies, helping to lower their buildup in the kidneys. The main goal of this study is to compare how felzartamab works compared to a drug called tacrolimus. Tacrolimus is another drug given to people with PMN and kidney disease.\n\nThe main question that researchers want to answer is:\n\n* How many participants achieve a complete response after 104 weeks of treatment?\n* A complete response means that their urine protein levels decrease to a low level and their kidney function remains stable.\n\nResearchers will also learn about:\n\n* How long it takes before the participants' disease gets worse\n* How long the participants' urine protein levels stay low\n* How many participants develop antibodies against felzartamab in the blood?\n* How many participants achieve a complete response after 76 weeks of treatment\n* How many participants have medical problems during the study\n* How felzartamab is processed by the body\n* How felzartamab affects participants' tiredness and overall physical health\n\nThe study will be done as follows:\n\n* Participants will be screened to check if they can join the study. This may take up to 42 days.\n* Participants will be randomized to receive either felzartamab as intravenous (IV) infusions or tacrolimus, taken orally as tablets.\n* If participants have worsening kidney function or worsening proteinuria, or if their PMN relapses, or if they show no signs of improvement in their PMN, they will have a chance to receive rescue treatment.\n* If a participant stops treatment early, there will be follow-up visits every 12 weeks until they reach Week 104.\n* In total, participants will have up to 23 study visits. Participants who do not need rescue treatment will stay in the study for up to 104 weeks. Participants who need rescue treatment will stay in the study for up to 156 weeks.",

If a person with MS has new symptoms that are concerning to them, their doctor may want to see them in the office in order to confirm that these symptoms are due to a true \"relapse\" of activity before starting relapse treatment. This requirement can be frustrating for patients, who may have to take time off from work or travel long distances for such unexpected doctors' visits. In this study, the investigators will use input from patients with MS and MS physicians to create a relapse questionnaire that can be used to confirm a relapse has occurred. The investigators will also evaluate if having a more direct line of communication with the provider's office improves overall patient care and satisfaction.",
