    "brief_summary": "Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is a kidney condition. It happens when the body's immune system creates groups of proteins (called immune complexes) that build-up in the kidneys causing swelling (inflammation). Over time, this inflammation may lead to kidney damage and cause the kidneys to no longer work properly. The main aim of this study is to check how well mezagitamab changes protein levels in the urine (proteinuria) compared to placebo in adults with primary IgAN. A placebo looks like medicine but doesn't have any active ingredients in it. Other aims are to check how safe mezagitamab is and how well participants with primary IgAN can tolerate it compared to placebo, and to find out if and how well mezagitamab continues to maintain kidney function over the long term compared to placebo.\n\nParticipants will be placed in 1 of the 2 treatment groups; the main group and the open-label group. In the main group, participants will be placed in 1 of the 2 treatment groups by chance (either mezagitamab or placebo) at a 2:1 ratio. This means that out of 3 participants, 2 will receive mezagitamab and 1 will receive placebo. The participants will receive either mezagitamab or placebo for almost half a year in two 1-year cycles. They will be observed for another half year in each 1-year cycle and will have check-ups about every month during this time.\n\nIn the open-label group, a small number of participants who have lower levels of protein in their urine or have kidneys that do not filter the blood well, will receive mezagitamab treatment. This will include participants who have previously received mezagitamab in another study, TAK-079-1006. Every participant will receive mezagitamab in the same way as those in the main group receiving mezagitamab.\n\nDuring the study, participants will visit their study clinic several times.",

However, recent studies showed that optimization of dose regimen of the same anti-TNF in these patients may still be associated with clinical response in 25% of patients. Indeed, in a recent bicentric, retrospective and non-randomized study, the investigators showed that IBD patients under ADA maintenance therapy who experience a secondary loss of response and in whom trough levels are \\>4.9\u00b5g/mL, swapping to another class was significantly better than optimizing ADA, in term of time without discontinuation of treatment.",

    "detailed_description": "Introduction Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by four distinct but closely related dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically around the world in recent decades, with cases reported to WHO increased from 505,430 cases in 2000 to 5.2 million in 2019. The total number of dengue cases in Malaysia has increased from merely 6,543 cases in year 1995 to 130,101 cases in year 2019. Knowledge, attitude and behaviour change remain the most effective driving tool against dengue infection and it becomes very necessary to plan an integrated module for primary prevention of dengue infection especially among school children. School-based health education is a crucial tool to enhance knowledge and raise awareness of the seriousness of dengue among school children, and to transfer knowledge and practices from classrooms to homes. The present study intends to develop, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of theory based integrated dengue education module in improving the knowledge, attitude, practice, environmental index and dengue index among school children in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nMethods Study design This is a two-arm randomised, single blinded, controlled, parallel, trial.\n\nStudy duration The study will be conducted over a period of 24 months, from 1st September 2023 until 31st August 2025, with data collection will be commenced on 1st November 2023.\n\nStudy location The study will be conducted in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nStudy population This study will be carried out in primary and secondary school under supervision of Ministry of Education (MOE). The study participants will be students standard four and form four school children from government primary and secondary school in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria The inclusion criteria for this study are i) Malaysian citizen, ii) standard 4 or form 4 from primary and secondary school respectively, iii) consented to participate in the study by parents or caregivers, and iv) consented by the school. The exclusion criteria i) not able to read Bahasa Malaysia or English, ii) physically or mentally impaired with disability card holder, and iii) temporary student as defined as less than 6 months during the study period.\n\nSample size estimation The sample size calculation for this study was calculated based on the primary outcome desire which is knowledge on dengue prevention and control. The sample size calculation was calculated using the formula for testing the different in proportion between two groups. After adjustment for attrition rate of 70% from previous study, the sample size needed for this study is 800 pairs of intervention and control groups which amount to 1600 participants.\n\nSampling method and subject recruitment This study will use a multistage sampling technique. The first stage of sampling will use proportionate sampling base on district in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur to select the 40 schools. One classroom will be selected form each selected school. Thus, the second stage sampling will randomly select 20 standard 4 classrooms and 20 form 4 classrooms from selected primary and secondary school respectively. All school children in selected classroom will be invited to participate in the study.\n\nRandomisation School cluster randomization will be used to ensure administrative efficacy, lessened risk of experimental contamination, and enhancement of subject compliance. 20 standard 4 classrooms and 20 form 4 classrooms from primary and secondary school, then will be divided randomly into intervention and control group. The unit of randomization will be on a 1:1 basis in either the control or intervention group.\n\nBlinding This study will use the single blinding method in which the respondent will not be aware of their group status. This type of blinding aims to minimize performance bias or also known as the Hawthorne effect in which the participant may change their responses or behaviour if they knew which group, they were allocate in (McCambridge et al., 2014). It is not possible to blind the field researcher as they would be the one who will deliver the intervention module to the selected respondents.\n\nResearch phase and tools This research protocol details the process of development, implementation, and effectiveness assessment of the theory based integrated dengue education module in improving the knowledge, attitude, practice, environmental cleanliness index and dengue index among school children in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur. The study will be conducted over 24 months, from June 2023 to May 2025. The study consists of three main phases, which are; Phase I: Need assessment Phase II: Development of Intervention module Phase III: Implementation and effectiveness measurement\n\nPhase I: Need assessment Need assessment of the intervention will be conducted through combination approach of community diagnosis. Assessment of the of current knowledge, attitude and practice on dengue prevention and control will be via literature review, survey, Nominal Group Discussion (NGD) and Focus Group Discussion (FGD) among subject matter expert (SME)) and stakeholder. All information will be used for module development (phase II) to design the method and media of delivery, content, and assessment.\n\nPhase II: Development of intervention module A systematic step-by-step procedure will be conducted for designing and developing the Theory Based Integrated Dengue Education Module.\n\nPhase III: Implementation and effectiveness measurement The Implementation of final module will be conducted at selected school. To ensure the standardisation of intervention, trained researcher will conduct the intervention at selected school. To ensure the standardisation, pre-recorded video, briefing and serial supervision by the main investigator will also be practiced throughout the intervention period. Pre and post intervention questionnaire will be collected using validated, self-administered questionnaires at four-time points (T0, T1, T2, T3) to measure the effectiveness of the intervention module.\n\nQuestionnaire\n\nA self-administrated questionnaire in two language versions (English and Malay) in printed format will be used in this study. The questionnaire used in the study is a new instrument that will be developed. The questionnaire will be divided into five parts as below:\n\nPart 1: respondent information. Consist of questions of sociodemographic data, socioeconomic and history of dengue infection.\n\nPart 2: Knowledge on dengue prevention and control Part 3: Attitude on dengue prevention and control Part 4: Practice on dengue prevention and control Part 5: Environmental cleanliness index and Aedes index\n\nValidity and reliability Content validity of the questionnaire will be assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SME) that include a public health medicine specialist, family medicine physicians, health educators, occupational health doctor, and occupational-related officer. This evaluation will be performed by various agencies such as the Ministry of Health, NIOSH, DOSH, SOCSO, and Ministry of Higher education. The content validation ratio (CVR) will be calculated to assess the acceptability of the questionnaire. Furthermore, the comments and feedback by the Subject Matter Experts (SME) will be taken into consideration for further correction of the questionnaire. In addition, the Content Validity Index (CVI) will be calculated to assess the relevance and clarity of the questionnaire by the assigned experts. Following that, the Item CVI (I-CVI) and the scale average CVI (S-CVI/Ave) will be calculated. The questionnaire will then be modified according to the agreement level of the experts based on the calculated CVI.\n\nThe reliability of the instrument will be measured using internal consistency method calculated in IBM SPSS (Version 28).\n\nData collection After the initiation of the study, consent will be obtained by the liaison officer from school children who fulfil the eligibility criteria. Subsequently baseline data (T0) will be obtained from school children who consented to join the study. Those subject who consented to join the study and will be allocated in the intervention group will be given appointment within 1 month for delivering of intervention package according to class. The total duration of intervention session will be around 30 minutes for 3 series of meeting. After completion of intervention, the school children will be asked to answer the post intervention assessment measuring outcome of the study immediately (T1), one month (T2) and three months (T3). The control group will undergo the same assessment as the intervention group at baseline, T1, T2 and T3. T\n\nEthics approval and consent to participate This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee for Research Involving Human Subjects of Universiti Putra Malaysia (JKEUPM-2023-347). All participants will be informed that their enrolment will in no way affect their relationship with their teacher. Consent from each participant parents' or caregiver' will be obtained using a consent form upon agreement to participate in the study before answering the baseline questionnaire. Participants are allowed to withdraw at any point during the study.\n\nConsent for publication and dissemination Consent from the participants for publication will be obtained from the same consent for participation. The results will be reported and presented in international peer-reviewed journals, conferences and other platforms. No personnel or school information will be disclosed in the dissertation writing and other published manuscript.",

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Bortezomib and ixazomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

    "detailed_description": "Aims of the study:\n\nTo evaluate the prevalence of Fabry Disease (FD) among a cohort of high risk patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) presenting at the University Hospital W\u00fcrzburg over the last 10 years. Fabry disease is a rare disease that is known to be consistently underdiagnosed due to its largely variable symptoms. Considering that an early Fabry diagnosis is crucial for maximum benefit from therapies available, screening for Fabry patients can contribute to preventing development and worsening of symptoms in Fabry patients with LVH. In addition, a positive diagnosis in a family member opens the possibility to diagnose further family members in an earlier stage of the disease, therefore allowing treatment of symptoms and organ manifestations before they become irreversible.\n\nBackground:\n\nFabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked disease caused by enzyme \u03b1-Galactosidase A (\u03b1GAL) deficiency resulting from mutations in the gene encoding this enzyme. Many patients present with a \"private\" specific mutation found only in that particular family and, thus, several hundreds of mutations are currently known. This multiplicity in mutations contributes to large variations in residual enzyme activity and different clinical presentations (Baptista A, 2015). Due to this variable phenotype, the disease is still largely underdiagnosed. Therefore, the reports of a prevalence of \\~1 per 40,000 / 100,000 persons in the general population are probably an underestimation (Terryn W, 2013). Previous screening studies for FD in high risk populations (left ventricular hypertrophy) report much higher frequencies, highlighting the need of including this disease among the differential diagnoses of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) of unexplained origin (Terryn W, 2012; Baptista A, 2015).\n\nLeft ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), detected both by imaging techniques (echocardiography, MRI) and by electrocardiography (ECG) is the predominant cardiac finding in Fabry patients (Linhart A, 2006). In a cross sectional study of untreated FD patients, half of the men and one third of the women were classified as having LVH (defined as LVMi of \\>51 g/m2.7 for males and \\>48 g/m2.7 for females) (Kampmann C, 2008). In screening studies in patients with LVH, the prevalence of FD is higher, including reports of a prevalence of up to 12% (Terryn W, 2012). Considering that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been shown to significantly reduce left ventricular mass and wall thickness, an early diagnosis and treatment of these patients has the potential to modify the natural course of the disease and reduce morbidity and mortality. In addition, it offers the important possibility to diagnose family members in an earlier stage of the disease.\n\nIn FD, myocardial hypertrophy is known to be progressive over time and occurs earlier in men than in women. In female heterozygotes, suggested random X chromosome inactivation and the inability of the cells expressing the wild type allele to cross correct the metabolic defects lead to symptoms that are similar to those in hemizygous males (Linhard A, 2006). Due to the heterozygous status in female patients, diagnosis is much more difficult with direct genetic analysis representing the gold standard. Cardiovascular involvement substantially contributes to disease-related morbidity and mortality in FD. Over the past decade, several studies have suggested that FD can present regularly in patients with an echocardiographic phenotype of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), defined by the presence of LVH in the absence of abnormal loading conditions such as arterial hypertension (AHT) or aortic valve abnormalities. It was supposed that these abnormal loading conditions generally explained LVH and therefore these patients were excluded in screening studies for FD so far. As a considerable part of the Fabry population has AHT and most of the patients with LVH followed by cardiologist in everyday practice have hypertension or valvular disease, a screening for FD in patients with LVH should include patients with hypertension and valvular disease, as will be the case in this current proposal. Establishing the cause of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a common challenge in clinical practice, given its high prevalence and the variety of diseases it may be associated with. This is particularly relevant from the clinical standpoint because of the therapeutic implications regarding the differential diagnoses. In this project we aim to assess the prevalence of FD in the W\u00fcrzburg cohort of patients with LVH presenting over the last years. The results of this project will not only contribute to give the proper diagnosis and treatment to so far unidentified Fabry patients, but is also anticipated to help highlighting the relevance of considering FD as a possible cause of LVH in general clinical practice.\n\nPrimary study objective:\n\nTo identify FD patients in the W\u00fcrzburg Cohort of patients with LVH of otherwise unexplained origin.",

The two medication regimens being compared are Valganciclovir (FDA approved to prevent and treat CMV infection) vs Maribavir (FDA approved to treat CMV infection) plus Acyclovir (FDA approved to prevent HSV infection).",
    "detailed_description": "Maribavir has been evaluated for the prevention of CMV infection in Phase II and Phase III trials within allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients. At 6-months post-transplant, the rates of CMV infection using PCR were not different between treatment and placebo arms, although the rates of pp65 antigenemia were lower in the Maribavir group. However, these studies used a low dose of 100mg PO BID. In subsequent studies within solid organ transplantation, Maribavir dosed at 400 to 1200mg PO BID was equally efficacious to valganciclovir for the treatment of CMV infection. Of note and importance to this proposal, the rates of neutropenia were 4-5% in the Maribavir treated patients vs. 15-18% in Valganciclovir patients. Thus, at an appropriate dose, Maribavir appears to have similar efficacy to Valganciclovir in treating CMV infection with a significantly reduced incidence of neutropenia. Currently, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials assessing the safety and efficacy of adequately dosed (=400mg PO BID) Maribavir for the prevention of CMV infection in solid organ transplant recipients.\n\nAim 1. Assess the incidence of leukopenia in those randomized to Maribavir vs. Valganciclovir prophylaxis in adult kidney transplant recipients at high-risk of CMV infection.\n\nHypothesis 1. The incidence of clinically meaningful leukopenia, defined as a WBC count of \\< 3,000 cells/mm3 and a reduction in total mycophenolate dose below 1,500 mg/day or valganciclovir dose below 900mg per day (adjusted for renal function), will be significantly lower in the Maribavir arm, as compared to the Valganciclovir arm.\n\nAim 2. Assess the efficacy of Maribavir vs. Valganciclovir prophylaxis in adult kidney transplant recipients at high-risk of CMV infection.\n\nHypothesis 2. The incidence of CMV infection and disease will be similar between the Maribavir arm, as compared to the Valganciclovir arm, at 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-transplant.\n\nAim 3. Assess the impact of Maribavir vs. Valganciclovir prophylaxis on healthcare utilization and costs in adult kidney transplant recipients at high-risk of CMV infection.\n\nHypothesis 3. Healthcare utilization will be lower in the Maribavir arm, as compared to the Valganciclovir arm, at 6- and 12-months post-transplant, driven predominantly by reduced number of telephone calls, televisits, and laboratory monitoring encounters.\n\nExploratory Aim 4. Assess the impact of Maribavir vs. Valganciclovir prophylaxis in adult kidney transplant recipients at high-risk of CMV infection on patient-reported outcomes for quality of life and satisfaction.\n\nExploratory Aim 5. Assess any differences in leukopenia, efficacy, healthcare utilization and patient reported outcomes by race and sex in patients randomized to Maribavir vs. Valganciclovir prophylaxis in adult kidney transplant recipients at high-risk of CMV infection.",

BV has shown promising results in other CD30 expressing non-hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including relapsed angio-immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases (PTLD) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with ORR rates of 50%, 40% and 45%, respectively. Despite expression of CD30 on tumor cells, no objective responses were observed in relapsed primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). Strikingly, thus far correlative studies have not found predictive markers in tissue or blood that are predictive for response to treatment. Since CD30 expression in tumor tissue is unrelated to treatment outcome, this suggests involvement of phenomena like tumor heterogeneity, drug uptake in the tumor micro-environment or very low CD30 expression below the immunohistochemistry (IHC) threshold. In this imaging study the biodistribution of brentuximab will be investigated by using Zirconium-89 (89Zr)-labeled brentuximab. 89Zr-brentuximab imaging will help to assess tumor uptake and pharmacokinetic (PK) and -dynamic properties of brentuximab in patients who are intended to be treated with BV, either in one of the registered indications (HL, CTCL and sALCL) or as part of the HOVON 136 trial for patients with DLBCL. The hypothesize is that the results of this imaging study might be used to facilitate the identification of patients that would benefit most from BV treatment",

    "detailed_description": "In recent years, the increase in drug-resistant bacteria and associated infections has become one of the major issues in the international community as adverse events associated with the inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents. Although the frequency and percentage of inappropriate use is currently unknown, it has been shown that at least 30% of antimicrobials prescribed in the U.S. are inappropriately used. If no action is taken against inappropriate antimicrobial use, it is estimated that 10 million people will die annually worldwide from drug-resistant organisms by 2050, with an estimated 4.9 million deaths related to drug-resistant organisms and 1.2 million deaths due to drug-resistant organisms already estimated for 2019. In addition, while the development of new antimicrobial agents has declined since the 1980s, the threat of new drug-resistant organisms, especially in hospitals, has increased, and if antimicrobial agents are not used appropriately, there is concern that there will be no effective antimicrobial agents available to treat infections in the future. It is important to avoid such situations by using antimicrobial agents, which are a limited resource, appropriately at this stage, and appropriate use of antimicrobial agents is necessary to prevent drug resistance (Antimicrobial Resistance: AMR).\n\nThird molar extraction is the most commonly performed procedure in oral and maxillofacial surgery. One of the main complications after third molar extractions is surgical site infection (SSIs), which is reported to manifest as swelling, pain, abscess, and fever. According to a Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials, the risk of SSIs after third molar extraction in physically fit young patients is about 10%, but in patients with low immunity before extraction, the risk increases up to 25%. Prophylactic administration of antimicrobial agents has an important role in preventing SSIs. However, the efficacy of antimicrobial prophylaxis against SSIs in third molar extractions is controversial. While some studies have reported that antimicrobials are effective in preventing SSIs after third molar extraction, others have reported that they are not.\n\nGuidelines for third molar extraction vary widely in the duration of antimicrobial administration (e.g., Japanese guidelines state a single dose to within 48 hours). In clinical practice, the final decision lies with the surgeon, but this difference in dosing period is a source of confusion. If the duration of administration could be shortened without increasing SSIs, it would contribute to the current presentation of AMR. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the effect of different durations and doses of penicillins, which are considered first-line drugs after third molar surgery, on the prevention of SSIs.",

In some people, the liver makes an abnormal version of the AAT protein, called Z-AAT. Making an abnormal version of the AAT protein can result in liver disease as Z-AAT builds up in liver cells, which leads to liver problems such as liver scarring (fibrosis), continuing liver damage (cirrhosis), and eventually endstage liver disease. Fazirsiran is a medicine that reduces the creation of the Z-AAT protein and thus the build-up of this abnormal protein in the liver. People with this type of liver disease who already have mild liver scarring will take part in the study. They will be treated with fazirsiran or a placebo for about 2 years. This study will check the long-term safety of fazirsiran, whether participants tolerate the treatment and if there are any effects on liver scarring.

The trial will be conducted in three parts: a dose escalation (Part 1), expansion phase (Part 2), followed by an extension phase (Part 3).\n\nThe objectives of the dose escalation phase (Part 1), is to determine the safety profile of orally administered TAK-788, including the MTD, DLTs, RP2D, pharmacokinetic profile. The primary goal of the expansion component of the trial is to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of TAK-788 in seven histologically and molecularly defined cohorts at the RP2D (determined based on dose escalation phase of the trial).\n\nThe seven expansion cohorts will be:\n\n1. NSCLC participants with EGFR exon 20 activating insertions, who have either not received or not shown an objective response to an EGFR TKI, and who have no active, measurable CNS metastases;\n2. NSCLC participants with HER2 exon 20 activating insertions or point mutations and no active, measurable CNS metastases;\n3. NSCLC participants with EGFR exon 20 activating insertions or HER2 exon 20 activating insertions or point mutations and active, measurable CNS metastases;\n4. NSCLC participants with other targets against which TAK-788 is active (examples include EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 substitutions \\[with or without T790M mutations\\] and other uncommon EGFR activating mutations), without active CNS metastases;\n5. NSCLC participants with EGFR exon 20 activating insertions, who have previously shown an objective response to an EGFR TKI and subsequently progressed, without active CNS metastases;\n6.

The patients will undergo evaluation with panenteric capsule endoscopy, intestinal ultrasound and inflammatory biomarkers before treatment onset, at week 14 and week 52",
    "detailed_description": "Mucosal healing has been widely accepted as the ultimate therapeutic goal in treatment of IBD patients and is associated with improved short and long-term outcomes in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (CD). However, the vast majority of the available clinical data pertains to colonic mucosal healing. In CD, the small bowel is involved in at least 75% of the patients, frequently in locations that are not accessible to ileocolonoscopy Active small bowel disease can be detected in at least 50% of CD patients in clinical remission\\[3\\]. Moreover, colonic and small bowel mucosal healing do not parallel each other, and it is quite common to detect inflammation in one segment while the other demonstrates endoscopically active disease.\n\nSmall bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) is the prime modality for evaluation of the entire small bowel\\[5\\]. It provides a safe and accurate way to screen and evaluate the entire small bowel, using a clinically validated endoscopic score such as the Lewis score (LS). Several studies evaluated the use of SBCE in monitoring mucosal healing in Crohn's disease, in both active and quiescent disease. The safety profile of SBCE in CD is excellent, especially after verification of small bowel patency using a patency capsule (PC).\n\nTo date, prospective data pertaining to the efficacy of biologics in induction of small bowel mucosal healing is very limited. The only prospective study to date was relatively small (36 patients) and demonstrated a significant improvement in mucosal inflammation and achievement of mucosal healing in patients that received Adalimumab and were evaluated with SBCE at week 0, 12 and 52 The rate of mucosal healing increased significantly from week 12 to 54.. No such data exists for other biologics. Recently, a combined pan-enteric capsule (PillCam Crohn's capsule) was developed by Medtronic. The capsule is based on an existing PillCam Colon 2 with a modified reading software. This capsule enables evaluation of mucosal inflammation and healing in the entire digestive tract in a single safe and non-invasive procedure. The new software of Rapid 9 includes a new method of describing the inflammatory burden on each of the 3 tertiles of the small bowel and two of the colon as well as the \"old\" Lewis score. In a feasibility 5 center prospective trial the capsule exited the colon while photographing in 83% of patients and reached the recto-sigma in 95%.\n\nIntestinal ultrasound (IUS) is an accurate, safe and cheap modality for bedside evaluation of the small bowel. It was evaluated for both diagnosis and monitoring of intestinal inflammation in CD, and can be also utilized to assess the response to treatment. Recently, a quantitative score (Limberg index (LI)) for quantification of small bowel inflammation on IUS was validated.\n\nThe aim of our study is to assess the utility of the Pillcam Crohn's capsule in assessment of panenteric mucosal healing in CD patients treated with vedolizumab Study interventions\n\nVisit 1 (before vedolizumab is started):\n\n* Clinical activity\n* Patients will perform patency capsule (PC) and give fecal sample for FC and microbiome.\n* If PC is safely excreted within 30 hours and FC \\> 100 mg/kg, the patient will undergo SBC and will be enrolled if LS \u2265 220 or CDEIS\\>5.\n* Blood will be drawn for measurement of CRP levels and complete blood count (CBC).\n* IUS will be performed. Second visit and third visit(week 14 and 52): will include clinical evaluation, CBC, CRP, FCP, microbiome, SBC and IUS.",

The mainstay of hemophilia treatment is factor replacement therapy with FVIII clotting factor concentrates (CFC) and these can be given episodically in response to bleeding or prophylactically to prevent bleeding. The main adverse effect of FVIII CFC is the development of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies termed inhibitors, and these render replacement therapy less effective if they are low titer inhibitors or completely ineffective if they are of the high titer variety. These so-called 'inhibitor patients' cannot rely on FVIII CFC for their treatment and are treated with other CFC called bypassing agents such as activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC/Feiba). While these agents can be effective in some patients for prophylaxis, they are not as effective for bleed prevention as FVIII CFC for patients without inhibitors.Recently, emicizumab (Hemlibra, Roche), was developed and licensed for the prevention of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A with and without inhibitors.

With this in mind, we propose to study the in vivo combination of Feiba in patients with inhibitors on emicizumab.\n\nIntervention: Administration of Feiba on the lower end of the licensed doses (or lower) and running thrombin generation assay (TGA) in patients on emicizumab.\n\nObjectives: To demonstrate the thrombin generation of the in vivo administration of Feiba at various doses to patients with congenital hemophilia A and inhibitors who are on emicizumab and to assess the safety of a single Feiba infusion in patients with congenital hemophilia A with inhibitors.\n\nStudy population: Male patients with congenital hemophilia A of any severity and any age with a history of high titer factor VIII inhibitor who are currently treated with emicizumab for a minimum of 2 months without interruption.\n\nStudy methodology: Patients who agree to participate will be infused a single, weight-based dose at each visit in the Infusion Center or the Outpatient Clinic. Depending on the thrombin generation of each individual patient following the initial dose, the study team will schedule the next infusion visit for subsequent Feiba dose.\n\nStudy endpoint: Once any patient on this trial achieves normal or near normal (within 10%) thrombin generation, they will not receive subsequent Feiba infusions even if that occurs after the lowest dose. Thus, no patient is expected to have excessive thrombin generation.\n\nStatistics: The study will only employ descriptive statistics. The main outcome measure will be to determine the dose of Feiba that most closely approximates normal thrombin generation in patients with congenital hemophilia A with inhibitors who are on emicizumab.\n\nPlans for analysis: the goal is to complete all study procedures within 12 months and have 2 months for data analysis and evaluation. Overall the goal is to complete the project including a submission for an abstract and publication within 14 months from the start of patient accrual.",

    "brief_summary": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (or TTP for short) is a condition where blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body. The clots can limit or block the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the body's organs, such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. As a result, serious health problems can develop. The increased clotting that occurs in TTP uses up the cells that help the blood to clot, called platelets. With fewer platelets available in the blood, bleeding problems can also occur. People who have TTP may bleed underneath the skin forming purple bruises, or purpura. TTP also can cause anemia, a condition in which red blood cells break apart faster than the body can replace them, leading to fewer red blood cells than in normal.\n\nTTP is caused by a lack of activity in the ADAMTS13 enzyme, a protein in the blood involved in controlling clotting of the blood. The ADAMTS13 enzyme breaks up another blood protein called von Willebrand factor that forms blood clots by clumping together with platelets. Some people are born with this condition, while others develop the condition during their life. Many people who are born with TTP experience frequent flare-ups that need to be treated right away. TAK-755 is a medicine that replaces ADAMTS13 and may prevent or control TTP flare-ups, called acute TTP events.\n\nThe main aim of the study is to check for side effects of long-term treatment with TAK-755. Treatment will be given in 2 ways:\n\n1. TAK-755 treatment given either every week or every other week to prevent acute TTP events from happening (the \"prophylactic\" cohort).\n2. TAK-755 treatment given to control an acute TTP event when it happens (the \"on-demand\" cohort).\n\nParticipants in the prophylactic cohort will receive treatment in the clinic or at home for up to approximately 3 years. They will visit the clinic at least every 12 weeks. Participants in the on-demand cohort will receive daily treatment for the acute TTP event until the flare-up has gotten better. They will have a follow-up visit at the clinic 4 weeks later.",

    "brief_summary": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is caused by food or acid coming up from the stomach into the esophagus, repeatedly. The esophagus is the tube that carries food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach. The body uses stomach acid to break down food, but when acid rises up into the esophagus it can hurt or damage it. People with GERD often feel food coming back up into the throat and mouth and have a burning feeling in their stomach, chest, or throat, called heartburn. Other symptoms of GERD include pain in the stomach or throat, difficulty eating, and throwing up. Sometimes GERD damages the lining of the esophagus, creating breaks. This is called erosive esophagitis (EE).\n\nDexlansoprazole is a type of medicine that helps lower the amount of acid made in the stomach. It has been shown to heal EE and maintain (keep) healing of EE in adults and teenagers. This study is being done to find out if dexlansoprazole can also heal EE and maintain the healing of EE in children.",

Approximately 76 patients will be enrolled in this study. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to receive dexlansoprazole 60 milligrams (mg) or dexlansoprazole 30 mg for 8 weeks during the Healing of EE Period. Following Week 8, participants will enter the Maintenance of Healed EE Period and will receive half their healing dose of dexlansoprazole, (i.e., either 30 mg, dexlansoprazole 15 mg).\n\nAll participants will be asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the study. All participants will be asked to record any time they have heartburn symptoms in a diary.\n\nParticipants who complete the 16 weeks of the Maintenance of Healed EE Period (Week 24) and have maintained healing of EE as confirmed by endoscopy, will enter a Post-Treatment Follow up Period for up to 3 months after the last dose of study drug. During this period participants will continue to complete the symptom questionnaires daily in the eDiaries and return for a clinic visit each month. Participants who require an invasive procedure or treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or histamine 2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)/EE will be discontinued from the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period and a Final Study Visit will be performed.\n\nThis multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide.

The aim of the study is to determine if treating to a target of corticosteroid-free (CS-free) IUS outcomes + clinical symptoms + biomarkers is superior to a target of clinical symptoms + biomarkers alone in achieving CS-free endoscopic remission measured by the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD).\n\nQualified participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of 2 different target treatment groups.\n\nGroup 1: Participants will be treated over 48 weeks to achieve a target of corticosteroid-free IUS-based outcomes + clinical remission + biomarker remission. At Week 22 and 30, the IUS-based component of the target will be IUS response and at Week 38, the final treatment target will be TMH. Group 2: Participants will be treated over 48 weeks to achieve a target of corticosteroid-free clinical remission + biomarker remission.",

    "detailed_description": "Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a lymphoid neoplasm characterized by the presence of CD30-positive Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells in a background of inflammatory cells. The majority of patients with HL have a good outcome with first-line chemotherapy such as ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) or BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine,procarbazine and prednisone) sometimes combined with radiation therapy. However, the same lymphoma has different results in the older than 60 years-old patients. This population of 60 years of age or older accounts for 20% of all HL cases. Age at diagnosis is an independent adverse prognostic factor for HL. The poor outcome in this group is due to both toxicity of chemo and radiotherapy resulting in higher treatment-related mortality and insufficient dosing of the applied treatment.\n\nMost clinical trials exclude older patients with HL because older patients have more unfavorable risk profiles and the approaches to treat older patients with HL with intensive regimens resulted in treatment associated mortality of up to 21%. More effective treatments to get better results in this patient population are required.\n\nIn 2001 the problem about the need for effective treatments with acceptable toxicity for the older patients with HL was discussed. After that different international groups accepted the challenge of trial organization for older patients with HL.\n\nTwo phase 2 studies were developed with modified chemotherapy regimens. The first, BACOPP (Bleomycin, doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone and procarbazine), was a BEACOPP regimen modified, used in younger patients. In this study, 65 patients with early unfavorable or advanced stage HL aged between 60 and 75 years were included.\n\nEighty-five percent of patients achieved complete remission, 3% achieved partial remission, and 7% developed progressive disease. Eighteen patients died (30%), including 7 treatment-associated deaths. This chemotherapy regimen although was effective, had an important toxicity in this older HL patient population. The second trial was PVAG (regimen composed of gemcitabine, prednisone, vincristine and adriamycin). The treatment was used in elderly HL patients in early unfavorable and advanced stages. Fifty-nine patients were enrolled in this study; 78% of patients achieved complete remission (CR) o CR uncertain; 3,4% responded with partial response; 25% didn't achieve a response or relapsed. Seventeen deaths were observed, but only 1 of them was secondary to treatment-related toxicity.\n\nThe VEPEMB phase II study (vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, prednisolone, procarbazine, etoposide, mitoxantrone and bleomycin) was also developed. For VEPEMB study, 105 HL patients over 65 years of age were treated, of which 48 were early stage (IA-IIA) HL patients and 57 were advanced stage (IIB-IV) HL patients. CR was achieved in 98% of early stage and 58% of advanced stage HL patients. Five-year actuarial OS rate was 94% in early stage and 32% in advanced stage HL patients. Two patients died during the treatment induction, but not related to treatment toxicity In the United Kingdom, the VEPEMB treatment was adopted in the new SHIELD (Study of Hodgkin in the Elderly Database) program, that was a prospective study made up of two components: I.) a phase II trial with VEPEMB treatment and II.) a prospective registration study of patients no treated as part of the VEPEMB study. One hundred and seventy-five patients were enrolled in this program, 103 patients received VEPEMB treatment and 72 patients received other therapies (ABVD regimen, CHOP, CLVPP regimen, etc). In this study, 74% of CR in early stage and 61% of CR in advanced stage in older HL patients were observed with the VEPEMB treatment. Three-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 81% and 74% respectively. Of patients achieving CR, 13% with early-stage and 5% with advanced-stage disease progressed. The overall treatment-related mortality was 7%. VEPEMB has demonstrated minimal pulmonary toxicity in this study, (only 1 patient). This therapeutic regimen provides adequate disease control in elderly patients with HL, with acceptable toxicity and sustained remission in those who have a complete response.\n\nBrentuximab vedotin (BV) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of three components: a) the chimeric anti-CD30 antibody cAC10, b) Monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) and c) a protease-cleavable linker that attaches MMAE to cAC10. Binding of BV to cells is followed by internalization of the ADC and cleavage of the peptide linker by lysosomal enzymes, and subsequent release of MMAE, an antimitotic agent, blocks the polymerization of tubulin, resulting in G2/M phase growth arrest and apoptotic death in a way similar to taxanes.\n\nMoreover, due to membrane permeability of MMAE, a possible cytotoxic effect on bystander malignant cells and surrounding stroma may occur. In vivo, BV inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis and complete tumor regression in mouse xenograft models of both HL and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) with improved efficacy relative to the unconjugated antibody.\n\nFirst Phase I trial was made in patients with relapsed/refractory CD30 positive lymphomas. Brentuximab vedotin was administered every 3 weeks at doses escalating from 0,1 to 3,6 mg/kg. Forty-five patients were treated in this study. Ninety-three percent of the patients had classical Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nThe maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for doses every 3 weeks was defined as 1,8mg/kg and the dose-limiting toxicities were febrile neutropenia, prostatitis. Objective responses were observed in 17 patients including 11 CR.\n\nA pivotal open-label, single arm Phase II trial studied the efficacy and safety of BV in patients with relapse or refractory HL after autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). The used dose was 1,8mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for a maximum of 16 infusions. One hundred two patients were enrolled with a median age of 31 years. The ORR was 75% and 34% of patients achieved a CR. The median duration of response was 6.7months and it increased up 20.5 months for patients who achieved a CR.\n\nThe most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurring in \\>10% of all patients were peripheral neuropathy (PN) (42%), nausea (35%), fatigue (34%), neutropenia (19%), diarrhea (18%), pyrexia (14%), vomiting (13%), arthralgia (12%), pruritus (12%), myalgia (11%), peripheral motor neuropathy (11%) and alopecia (10%).\n\nThe combination of BV with ABVD and AVD chemotherapeutic regimens was investigated in a phase I study in 51 untreated patients with HL. The maximum tolerated dose of BV combined with ABVD or AVD was not reached and no DLT was observed up to 1.2 mg/kg every 2 weeks.\n\nHowever, an increased incidence of pulmonary toxicity was observed with the association with bleomycin. Ninety-two percent of patients achieved CR which compares favorably with historical controls. A phase 3 study comparing BV combined with AVD versus ABVD alone is ongoing.\n\nBased on the previous phase I study of Younes of the combination of BV with ABVD or AVD therapy, no dose-limiting toxicity were observed with 1.2 mg/Kg of BV, and the maximum tolerated dose was not exceeded at 1.2 mg/Kg of BV combined with ABVD or AVD. Since the combination of BV and EPEM has not been tested before a safety run in stage phase is added to the protocol.",

    "brief_summary": "Idiopathic Hypersomnia (IH) is a condition where people feel extremely sleepy during the day, especially in the morning, even if they sleep a lot at night. They may have trouble waking up in the morning, no matter how much they sleep (sometimes more than 11 hours per day), and they can't help feeling tired, even after taking daytime naps. Because of this sleepiness, they may have trouble focusing, thinking clearly, or keeping up with daily activities. They may also have symptoms like dizziness or feeling lightheaded. Orexin is a chemical made in the brain that helps keep a person awake and alert. TAK-360 acts like orexin. Previous studies have shown that medicines that act like orexin may keep people awake.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to learn how safe TAK-360 is and how well adults with IH tolerate it. Researchers also want to find out if TAK-360 can help people with IH stay awake and how much TAK-360 is needed to do that.\n\nParticipants will be randomly (by chance, like drawing names from a hat) chosen to receive either TAK-360 or a placebo. The placebo looks just like TAK-360 but does not have any medicine in it. Using a placebo helps researchers learn about the real effect of the treatment.",

Dexamethasone, also FDA approved, is a type of steroid and is usually combined with other chemotherapy for the treatment of blood cancers, such as myeloma and leukemias.\n\n* Ixazomib targets a part of cells called proteasomes. It works by slowing down or blocking proteasomes from doing their job of digesting proteins. In myeloma cells, there is a greater need for proteasomes to digest proteins; the buildup of excess proteins causes cell death.\n* Pomalidomide has also been shown to cause tumor cell deaths. Dexamethasone can stop white blood cells from traveling to areas myeloma cells are causing damage. When combined with myeloma drugs, it sometimes makes those drugs work better.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are:\n\n* Testing the safety of ixazomib when given with pomalidomide and dexamethasone\n* Pomalidomide and ixazomib are given individually for the treatment of multiple myeloma.

    "detailed_description": "This study consists of 2 phases: Dose-escalation and cohort-expansion phase.\n\nDose-escalation phase:\n\nThe purpose of the dose-escalation phase is to generate data to characterize the initial safety and tolerability profile of TAK-280 and determine the 2 recommended doses for expansion (RDEs) of TAK-280 to be administered during the cohort-expansion phase.\n\nCohort-Expansion Phase:\n\nThe cohort expansion phase will be conducted in 3 indications. Only in 1 selected indication participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either TAK-280 high dose or low dose. In the remaining 2 indications to be studied in the cohort-expansion phase, participants will receive only one dose level of TAK-280.",

    "brief_summary": "This is a multi-arm phase II platform-basket screening study designed to test multiple experimental therapies simultaneously in patients with NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2-SWN, formerly known as neurofibromatosis type 2) with associated progressive tumors of vestibular schwannomas (VS), non-vestibular schwannomas (non-VS), meningiomas, and ependymomas.\n\nThis Master Study is being conducted as a \"basket\" study that may allow people with multiple tumor types associated with NF2-SWN to receive new drugs throughout this study. Embedded within the Master Study are individual drug substudies.\n\n* Investigational Drug Sub-study A: Brigatinib\n* Investigational Drug Sub-study B: Neratinib",
    "detailed_description": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of investigational drugs to learn whether the drug(s) works in treating a specific disease. As a basket study, the trial will enroll patients with NF2-SWN with associated progressive tumors of vestibular schwannomas (VS), non-vestibular schwannomas (non-VS), meningiomas, and ependymomas\n\nThe MASTER STUDY is intended to enroll participants who will be allocated into different treatment arms (SUB-STUDIES) which will each have an additional consent and enrollment processes.\n\nMASTER STUDY\n\n-- The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, randomization to an experimental treatment sub-study, if qualified, and observation for up to 10 years.\n\n* Participants who have tumors grow during a treatment sub-study will be permitted to enroll in a different experimental treatment sub-study if they are eligible.\n* Participants who are not eligible for enrollment in a different treatment sub-study will be permitted to remain under observation on the Master Study to understand the growth pattern of these tumors (natural history)\n\n  * Participants will be eligible to remain on this Master study for up to 10 years.\n  * It is expected that about 80 people will take part in the Master Study\n  * The study will randomize a maximum of 40 patients to each of the experimental arms. The overall size of the trial is not fixed by design because it include arm-dropping rules for futility and allow for the possibility of arm addition by amendment.\n\nSUB-STUDY A (brigatinib) Drug Sub-study A will test the activity of brigatinib for treatment of NF2-related tumors.\n\n* Brigatinib is approved for the treatment of people with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)- positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed or are intolerant to crizotinib. In preclinical models, brigatinib has shown evidence of activity against models of NF2-deficient tumors.\n* Forty (40) people will take part in the Brigatinib Sub-study.\n* The sub-study with brigatinib includes two stages.\n* In Stage 1, 20 subjects with any allowable tumor type will be accrued to each arm. A minimum of 2 subjects per tumor type (vestibular schwannoma, non-vestibular schwannoma, meningioma, and ependymoma) must be accrued in Stage 1. Interim analysis will be performed after Stage 1 to determine the radiographic response rate (RR) for each tumor types. Subsequently, in stage 2, another 20 subjects will be accrued into the 2 baskets with the most promising early results. If the results are equally promising for more than 2 baskets, subjects will be allocated to the appropriate number of baskets.\n\nSUB-STUDY B (neratinib) Collaborator: National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) through a grant provided by Puma Biotechnology Drug Sub-study B will test the activity of neratinib for treatment of NF2-related tumors.\n\n* Neratinib is approved for the treatment of people with early stage HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer following treatment with trastuzumab-based therapy. In preclinical models, neratinib has shown evidence of activity against models of NF2-deficient tumors.\n\n  - It is expected that 20 people will take part in the Neratinib Sub-study. A minimum of 2 subjects per tumor type (vestibular schwannoma, non-vestibular schwannoma, meningioma, and ependymoma) must be accrued. Analysis will be performed to determine the radiographic response rate (RR) for each tumor types.\n* A subset of 5 participants will be enrolled into the PET imaging biomarker study. These participants will have additional PET scans performed just prior to the first dose of neratinib and after starting the treatment (witin 24 to 72 hours).",
