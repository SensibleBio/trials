    "detailed_description": "The slow progress for notable trials in metastatic, hormone-sensitive disease is attributed to the long duration of follow-up required, as well as the focus on time-to-event end points, i.e. overall survival, in clinical trial design. These landmark trials (CHAARTED, STAMPEDE, LATITUDE), which used overall survival as their endpoints, required, on average, 10 years from start of trial to first peer-reviewed publication. Given the challenge of using traditional measures of response (RECIST criteria) when designing prostate cancer clinical trials, the Prostate Cancer Working group 2 (PCWG2) made trial-design recommendations. One was to separate treatment outcomes into early measures of response and later time-to-event measures of progression. The goal is to shift the trial objective to capture and reflect the actual effect of the tested treatment and, in doing so, provide a more timely drug development milieu for the metastatic patient. These early measure of response end points, such as undetectable PSA with testosterone recovery, are now being actively integrated into clinical trial design.",

    "brief_summary": "Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO).\n\nIn people with RVO, a blood vessel that carries blood away from the retina (vein) becomes blocked. The retina is the very back part of the eye. The blocked vein causes fluid and blood to leak into the retina and thereby causes a swelling of the macula (the center of the retina responsible for fine vision). This swelling is called macular edema.\n\nWhen a vein in the retina is blocked, the levels of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) rises. VEGF helps the growth of new blood vessels. This can lead to macular edema and may cause the vision to become blurry.\n\nThe study treatment intravitreal (IVT) aflibercept is given as an injection into the eye. It works by blocking VEGF and this can help repair vision problems related to RVO. IVT aflibercept is already available and is prescribed by doctors as the standard of care treatment for macula edema secondary to RVO. Standard of care is a treatment that medical experts consider most appropriate for a disease.\n\nStandard of care is given every 4 weeks in people with macula edema secondary to RVO. While repeated injections of aflibercept may prevent worsening of vision, it may place a burden on the patient. However, a higher amount (8 mg) compared to the standard of care (2 mg) of IVT aflibercept is being tested in studies. This higher amount could be given less often. The amount of IVT aflibercept given is measured in milligrams, also known as mg.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn how well a higher amount of the study treatment aflibercept works in people with macular edema secondary to RVO. To answer this, researchers will measure changes in vision called best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the study participants between study start and after 36 weeks of treatment. Changes will then be compared between those participants who received the higher amount of IVT aflibercept and those that received standard of care.\n\nTo learn how safe the study treatment is in the participants, the researchers will count the number of participants from study start and up to 64 weeks later that have:\n\n* adverse events\n* serious adverse events\n\n\"Adverse events\" are any medical problems that the participants have during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think they might be related to the study treatments. An adverse event is considered \"serious\" when it leads to death, puts the participants' lives at risk, requires hospitalization, causes disability, causes a baby being born with medical problems or is otherwise medically important.\n\nDependent on the treatment group, the participants will either receive the higher amount of aflibercept or standard of care as an intravitreal injection for up to 60 weeks. The study will consist of a test (screening) phase, a treatment phase and an end of study phase. Each participant will be in the study for up to 64 weeks.\n\nOne visit to the study site is planned during the screening phase, followed by visits approximately every 4 weeks (16 in total) during treatment and one visit at the end of the study.\n\nDuring the study, the study doctors and their team will:\n\n* check patients' eye health using various eye examination techniques\n* measure patients' eye vision (BCVA)\n* take blood and urine samples\n* do physical examinations\n* check vital signs\n* examine heart health using electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* do pregnancy tests in women of childbearing age\n\nIn addition, participants will be asked to fill a questionnaire on vision-related quality of life.",

In rabbit models, the half-life of both bevacizumab and ranibizumab were reduced by a factor 1.8 and 1.3, respectively, after pars plana vitrectomy. In a study examining intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide in human eyes, the half-life was found to be 18.6 days in non-vitrectomized eyes and 3.2 days in vitrectomized eyes, but there was considerable intrasubject variation. Patients with various disease states, including neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) have been managed with monthly anti-VEGF therapy successfully after vitrectomy surgery. Another study performed by the DRCR net showed that patients with DME treated with anti-VEGF are not affected in the long term if they had had a previous vitrectomy. High dose aflibercept may improve anatomic and visual outcomes in this patient population. Also, high dose aflibercept may allow for longer treatment intervals in these vitrectomized eyes.",
    "detailed_description": "Patients with Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) and previous Pars Plana Vitrectomy (PPV) will be treated with a treat-extend-stop (TES) protocol that was previously published. Below is the description of the TES protocol published in the International Journal of Retina and Vitreous. This protocol was originally used in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) but it is being adapted for treatment of patients with DME in this study.\n\nPatients were treated following the treat-and-extend-stop (TES) protocol, which is a variant to the treat-and-extend regimen. The TES treatment protocol required 3 loading injections at 4-to-6-week treatment interval. Upon clinical examination and on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), dosing interval was extended by 1 to 2 weeks in patients with dry macula. Any evidence of fluid on OCT and decreased vision was carefully monitored. If fluid or worsening of vision was detected, the dosing interval was reduced. After successful management of patients following decreased interval, patients were allowed to increase interval by 1 week for the next 2 to 4 injections. In patients with good response without worsening vision, but exhibiting presence of mild fluid during the initial 4 to 6 week treatment interval, the same interval was maintained. In patients with complete absence of fluid in the macula, dosing interval was extended by 1 to 2 weeks. Extension of dosing interval continued until 12 weeks was reached between visits. To avoid recurrence of fluid, patients were monitored carefully once the 12-week interval was reached. Patients who experienced deterioration of vision or increase in metamorphopsia were instructed to contact the office for earlier return visit.\n\nIn this study, patients that have had a previous vitrectomy and have DME will be treated with high dose aflibercept until fluid has resolved and then the time interval in between treatments for those patients will be extended, while maintaining a fluid-free macula.\n\n* VEGF Trap, 8 mg is intended for intravitreal administration.\n* VEGF Trap, 8 mg study drug will be provided in single-use vial\n* The appearance of the vial will be in clear glass 2R vial with 13 mm West 4432/50 gray stopper with FluroTec\u00ae coatings and 13 mm royal blue flip-off seal.\n* The formulation of the VEGF Trap, 8 mg is sterile, vialed VEGF Trap recombinant protein, 114.3mg/mL, in an aqueous buffered solution, pH 5.8, containing 50 mM arginine monohydrochloride, 10 mM histidine, 5% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.03% (w/v) polysorbate 20.\n* Store refrigerated at 2\u00b0C - 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F - 46\u00b0F) in the original carton to protect from light.\n\nVisual acuity and CMT will be recorded prior to vitrectomy and prior to inclusion into the trial, after the PPV. Visual acuity and CMT will be recorded at each treatment visit. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) will also be assessed at the visit prior to inclusion using wide-field fundus photos (FP) and fluorescein angiography (FA). DR will also be assessed as a secondary endpoint at 6 months and at the one-year visit utilizing FP and FA\n\nStudy Duration\n\nThe study duration will be one-year of active treatment with high-dose aflibercept in patients with DME that have been previously vitrectomized.\n\nSafety Reporting including SAEs, AESI and Pregnancy\n\nSafety reports will be transmitted to post-approval surveillance, per usual protocol for phase 4 studies, including SAEs, AESIs and pregnancy. For SAEs, these will be reported to both post-approval surveillance, Regeneron and the ASRS ReST committee. SAEs would include death, cerebrovascular incidents, myocardial infarction, hospitalization and a decrease in vision over 6 lines. AESIs would include inflammatory events including uveitis and iritis, intraocular inflammation, retinal detachment/retinal tear, traumatic cataract, transient elevation in intraocular pressure requiring glaucoma surgery, or managed by greater than three new glaucoma drops. Efforts will be made to not include patients that are pregnant and those patients that are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant will be excluded.\n\nFurther safety reporting details are outlined as below. Safety Reporting i) Adverse Event Reporting. The Institution agrees that the Sponsor Investigator shall report the following safety information in connection with the Regeneron Product to Regeneron at medical.safety@regeneron.com within twenty-four (24) hours of awareness, and it shall be collected/recorded in English on the FDA MedWatch Form or other safety reporting form as applicable:\n\n1. All Serious Adverse Events (\"SAEs\") (regardless of causality) from the time of consent through 30 days of the last dose of the Regeneron Product (VEGF Trap, 8mg).\n\n   (a) SAEs as defined by FDA 21 CFR 312.32, which includes, for the avoidance of doubt, adverse events that: (i) are life-threatening, and/or (ii) result in (A) death, (B) in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, (C) persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or (D) a congenital anomaly or birth defect; and (b) all serious and/or nonserious reports of: (i) overdose, (ii) abuse, (iii) misuse, (iv) medication error (defined as an unintended failure in the drug treatment process that leads to, or has the potential to lead to, harm to the Study subject (for example, issues related to dispensing and administration which VEGF Trap, 8 mg (Aflibercept HD) - Protocol Guidance either (A) reach the Study subject or (B) are intercepted and never reached a Study subject, but had the potential to cause harm), (v) occupational exposure and/or (vi) lack of therapeutic efficacy.\n\n   (i) Symptomatic overdose (dose greater than 8 mg), including overdose due to medication error, i.e., error in prescription, administration, dispensing, dosage, unauthorized indication or population\n2. Adverse Events of Special Interest (\"AESIs\") occurring during the study (a) n/a for VEGF Trap, 8mg inflammatory events including uveitis and iritis, intraocular inflammation, retinal detachment/retinal tear, traumatic cataract, transient elevation in intraocular pressure requiring glaucoma surgery, or managed by greater than three new glaucoma drops.\n3. Pregnancy. (a) Any pregnancy occurring in a female Study subject \\[or female partner of a male Study subject\\], during the Study or within 120 days of the last dose of the Regeneron Product. (b) Any complication of pregnancy affecting a female Study subject \\[or female partner of a male Study subject\\], and/or fetus and/or newborn that meets the SAE criteria. (c) Outcomes for all such pregnancies.\n\nii) Safety Reporting Requirements to FDA. The Sponsor Investigator will record and report safety information in accordance with the Protocol and will report safety information to the FDA or local health authority in accordance with the applicable requirements. Additionally, all reports to the FDA or local health authority shall be reported to Regeneron. A detailed narrative summarizing the course of the event, including its evaluation, treatment, and outcome should be provided on the MedWatch Form or other reporting form as may be provided by Regeneron. Specific or estimated dates of event onset, treatment, and resolution should be included, when available. Medical history, concomitant medications, and laboratory data that are relevant to the event should also be summarized in the narrative. For fatal events, the narrative should state whether an autopsy was or will be performed and include the results if available. Information not available at the time of the initial report must be documented in a follow-up report. Source documents (including hospital or medical records, diagnostic reports, etc.) shall be summarized in the narrative on the FDA MedWatch Form or other reporting form as may be provided by Regeneron retained by the Sponsor Investigator and shall be available upon request.\n\nSAE Reporting Period:\n\nThe SAEs that are subject to this reporting provision are those that occur from time of informed consent through 30 days after discontinuation of the Regeneron product. SAEs that occur more than 30 days after discontinuation of the Regeneron product will be reported only if the investigator believes the study drug caused the AE/SAE.\n\nSafety Reporting Mailbox: medical.safety@regeneron.com\n\nStatistical Considerations including the sample size justification\n\nFifteen patients would be planned to be included in this phase 4 study. This should provide statistical power to assess visual acuity improvements and CMT decrease from baseline interval between high dose aflibercept therapy. This should also allow for enough power to compare both PK data and cytokines levels in patients, with and without vitrectomy, with DME Statistical analysis would be two-armed students paired t-testing and ANOVA testing.",

    "detailed_description": "Approximately 12% of adults in the United States, United Kingdom and other industrialized nations suffer from chronic sinus disease. Corticosteroids and antibiotic regimens are often used to treat the condition but the level of evidence to justify this approach is limited and at best offers only a transient solution. Furthermore, adverse side effects from the use of long-term oral steroids and concerns about skewing of the mucosal microbiota from overuse of antibiotics make these options problematic.\n\nCurrently, there are insufficient options for the approximately 30 million patients in the US suffering from chronic sinus disease. Recent phase 3 clinical trials found that dupilumab, an anti-IL4\u03b1 receptor monoclonal antibody, reduces symptoms and polyp size in individuals with CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Similarly anti-IL5 antibodies have also been shown to have modest efficacy in this group of patients. However, for the approximately 65% of individuals with non-polyp related chronic sinus disease, these agents were not evaluated and there remains few viable options for therapy.\n\nChronic rhinosinusitis is defined as symptoms of nasal obstruction, facial pain or pressure, and mucopurulent drainage for at least 12 weeks along with evidence of mucosal disease by radiographic evidence or rhinoscopy. At least ten endotypes have been described although there is considerable overlap in terms of mucosal morphology, allergic status, the presence of polypoid tissue, and expression of biomarkers such as cytokines, specific IgE and other proteins. It may be incorrect to assume that the effectiveness of dupilumab demonstrated for those suffering with nasal polyps is exclusive to this CRS cluster alone.\n\nOne aspect to explain the differential effects of certain drugs and biologics on the treatment of CRS relates to host nasal and sinus microbial environment. The microbiome of CRS patients has been found to have reduced diversity, increased bacterial populations, and ultimately to have less stable bacterial networks. This imbalance of the microbiome may be a potential cause for sinus inflammation. Studies have demonstrated that Propionibacterium acnes for example, acts as an important stabilizing organism in the bacterial networks. Removal of this bacterial species e.g. from antibiotic use, may allow for more pathogenic organisms such as Staphylococcus or Streptococcus to flourish leading to increased inflammation.\n\nAn example of how Staphylococcus aureus may increase inflammation is through the production of superantigen that is thought to skew nasal inflammatory responses towards a Th2 dominated disease endotype. Other groups, have concluded that the host mucosal microbiota helps predict disease severity and might also predict susceptibility to certain therapies. Indeed, treatment with certain antibiotics has shown to modulate mucosal bacterial populations leading to clinical improvement and reduced polyp formation in some patients. It is not known whether host microbial and inflammatory milieu adequately predicts polyp formation or helps predict treatment success in the presence of dupilumab. The current study will include investigation of this important exploratory outcome.\n\nThe investigators have previously shown that modulation of both the innate and adaptive immune responses can impact dendritic cell and basophil responses in vitro and that these changes correlate with treatment success of patients with chronic allergic rhinosinusitis. The investigators also more recently discovered that IL-4 and IL-13 secreted by human basophils upregulates CD20 (mannose receptor), CD23 (Fc\u03b5RII) and pSTAT6 expression on monocytes, while also promoting CCL17 (TARC) production by these cells. Other investigators have shown that the mannose receptor on monocytes negatively modulates TLR-4 innate immune signaling on dendritic cells that in turn affects T-cell polarization and response to allergens. The investigators might expect dupilumab to help attenuate this pathway resulting in a reduction of local sIgE production in the mucosa for example. It is already known that dupilumab reduces the expression of other inflammatory mediators such as CCL17 in asthma and atopic dermatitis. These aspects will be examined in the exploratory investigations using cell culture assays, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence pre and post treatment.\n\nThe overarching objective of this study is to determine the clinical effectiveness of dupilumab for the treatment of CRS that includes several potential disease endotypes with the exclusion of the nasal polyp cluster that has previously been determined. The additional information gained from secondary and exploratory outcomes will help provide important insight for applied research studies and may also provide practical guidance to clinicians on how to select patients for treatment.",

The study is looking at patients who have severe IgE-mediated food allergy. If the patient has an allergy, the body's defense system (immune system) overreacts to an allergen (eg, certain foods like peanuts, milk, shellfish) by making antibodies called IgE. An antibody is a protein that allows the immune system to find and fight off things the body does not recognize (allergens). IgE antibodies are sent out by cells like plasma cells. These antibodies and allergens bind to other cells that send out chemicals, causing an allergic reaction. The aim of the study is to see what side effects happen when linvoseltamab is combined with dupilumab.\n\nThe study is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* What side effects may happen from taking the study drugs\n* Does linvoseltamab combined with dupilumab affect other types of antibodies in the blood at different times\n* How much study drug(s) is in the blood at different times",

The study is focused on participants who have one of two types of cancer: follicular lymphoma (FL) or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) that has come back after treatment (called \"relapsed\"), or did not respond to treatment (called \"refractory\"). FL and MZL are subtypes of Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma (NHL).\n\nThis study will be made up of two parts (Part 1 not randomized, Part 2 randomized - controlled).\n\nThe aim of Part 1 of the study is to see how safe and tolerable the study drug is when used in combination with lenalidomide, in participants with FL or MZL, and to determine the dose of the study drug to be used in Part 2 of this study. This combination is considered \"first-in-human\" as it has not been tested as a combination treatment in humans before.\n\nThe aim of Part 2, of the study is to assess how the combination of the study drug and lenalidomide works compared to the combination of rituximab (called \"the comparator drug\") and lenalidomide. The combination of comparator drug and lenalidomide is the current standard-of care treatment for FL and/or MZL. Standard of care means the usual medication expected and used when receiving treatment for a condition.\n\nThe study is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* What side effects may happen from taking the study drug in combination with lenalidomide\n* How much study drug is in the blood at different times\n* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug (which could make the study drug less effective or could lead to side effects)\n* The impact from the study drug on quality of life and ability to complete routine daily activities",

Odronextamab is a bispecific antibody that can bind to two different antigens at the same time. Odronextamab binds to CD3, a T-cell surface antigen, and CD20 (a tumor-associated antigen that is expressed on B-cells during most stages of B-cell development and is often overexpressed in B-cell cancers) and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Bridging therapy has been used to maintain disease control and to increase the chance of successful receipt of CAR-T cell therapy. However, bridging therapy is typically given after leukapheresis, which does not help prevent disease progression between the decision for CAR-T cell therapy and leukapheresis. Giving odronextamab as bridging therapy before leukapheresis may delay disease progression to allow leukapheresis and increase the likelihood of successful CAR-T cell therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphomas.",
    "detailed_description": "OUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive odronextamab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16 of cycle 1 (dose step-up), and on days 1, 8 and 15 of cycles 2-4 and then once every other week of remaining cycles. Cycles repeat every 21 days for the first 4 cycles, then every other week for up to a total of 12 months (including the first 2 cycles). After 2 cycles, patients undergo leukapheresis followed by lymphodepletion and CAR-T infusion per standard of care. If there is a significant delay of leukapheresis, patients may receive up to 12 additional weeks of treatment. Patients who achieve CR after cycle 2 may opt out of leukapheresis and CAR-T cell infusion and may continue to receive odronextamab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), collection of blood and oral or rectal swab samples and tissue biopsy throughout the study. Additionally, patients may undergo lumbar puncture and bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed till 90 days or the initiation of the next lymphoma directed therapy for toxicity check, and total duration of follow-up is up to 5 years.",

    "detailed_description": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents more than 80% of lung cancers, and approximately 35% of NSCLC patients present with stage III disease. Standard treatment for patients with locally advanced NSCLC, which may be defined as American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage III disease or unresectable stage II disease, typically consists of conventionally fractionated (1.8-2.0 Gray (Gy) per day) radiotherapy (RT) to a total dose of approximately 60 Gy with concurrent chemotherapy. Based on the PACIFIC trial (NCT02125461), patients without disease progression after concurrent chemoradiotherapy are typically offered a one-year course of the adjuvant PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab, regardless of PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS). Recent results from the PACIFIC-2 trial (NCT03519971) failed to demonstrate a survival benefit of adding concurrent durvalumab to chemoradiotherapy, and therefore the PACIFIC regimen of adjuvant immunotherapy following chemoradiation remains the standard of care for unresectable LA-NSCLC.\n\nBased on the PACIFIC trial standard, both the RT and systemic therapy utilized to treat LA-NSCLC patients in standard of care follow a non-biomarker selected \"one-size-fits-all\" approach in the US. In advanced NSCLC, however, patients with high PD-L1 TPS score (\u2265 50%) benefit more from the immune checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, and cemiplimab compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy alone, and single agent immunotherapy (IO) has become a first-line standard of care for such patients. Omitting chemotherapy from the treatment of LA-NSCLC patients with high PD-L1 expression who will receive IO is a logical step. On the other hand, patients with low PD-L1 TPS score (\\< 50%) benefit less from single agent IO in advanced NSCLC, and IO is typically offered together with chemotherapy. Given the poor response to IO for patients with low PD-L1 TPS expression, the investigator team believes that combination IO plus chemotherapy could be particularly beneficial in the low-TPS LA-NSCLC setting.\n\nInduction (also referred to as neoadjuvant) IO before RT for LA-NSCLC has several potential advantages. For example, the native tumor functioning as an in-situ vaccine in the neoadjuvant setting, with an intact lymphatic system and unirradiated nodal status, could promote optimal immune priming. Indeed, neoadjuvant IO has shown impressive efficacy in both deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) rectal cancer and melanoma. For early-stage NSCLC, this approach is highlighted in recent neoadjuvant trials of immune checkpoint inhibition in combination with chemotherapy for resectable NSCLC, such as CheckMate 816 (NCT02998528), Keynote-671 (NCT03425643), and NADIMII (NCT03838159). Furthermore, results from the PACIFIC trial and real-world data show that approximately 25% of LA-NSCLC patients started on chemoradiotherapy never receive consolidation durvalumab, and approximately 50% of patients started on consolidation durvalumab do not complete the intended year of treatment. Thus, administering induction IO may be particularly advantageous for LA-NSCLC patients to enhance IO treatment delivery.\n\nSPRINT (NCT03523702) was a multi-institutional Phase II trial where biomarker-selected (PD-L1 TPS \u2265 50%) LA-NSCLC patients were treated with 3 cycles of induction pembrolizumab to reduce the extent of thoracic RT, and cytotoxic chemotherapy was omitted from the treatment regimen. Patients with PD-L1 TPS \\< 50% received standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) followed by standard adjuvant treatment, to serve as a non-randomized comparator for evaluating toxicities and clinical outcomes. Following induction, PD-L1 TPS \u2265 50% patients received PET-based dose-painted RT according to a novel and personalized approach that was studied in two prior trials (NCT02073968, NCT03481114) that can decrease toxicities by utilizing shortened courses of RT and reducing doses administered to small tumors and nodes. Based on these studies, PET response to induction IO using PERCIST criteria may serve as a useful prognostic factor to identify LA-NSCLC patients more likely to respond to novel IO regimens at an earlier time point in treatment (prior to administration of RT). This observation is also supported by prior prospective and retrospective studies showing that response on PET rather than CT may be a better predictor of survival for NSCLC patients receiving IO. Furthermore, early identification of IO response provides added insight to a tumor's unique immune biology that could be used to individualize subsequent RT, IO, and/or chemotherapy treatment plans. Overall, SPRINT demonstrated high treatment efficacy with limited toxicity and introduces PET response to induction IO as a novel endpoint that allows for early assessment of treatment activity, and which could potentially serve as a new paradigm in LA-NSCLC interventional studies.\n\nBased on this experience, the investigator team believes that the SPRINT treatment approach (induction IO followed by RT and consolidation IO) can be used to investigate other novel IO combinations for biomarker-selected LA-NSCLC. One such immune target is lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3), which is expressed by various immune cells, and regulates effector T-cell activation and responses. LAG-3 inhibition restores the effector function of exhausted T cells, enhancing their ability to attack tumor cells. In addition, LAG-3's inhibitory effects on T cells appear distinct from those of PD-L1, serving as a potential rationale for combining LAG-3 and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition. In metastatic melanoma, the RELATIVITY-047 trial (NCT03470922) showed that combination PD-1 and LAG-3 blockade with nivolumab and relatlimab, respectively, improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared to nivolumab alone with a favorable toxicity versus nivolumab plus the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab. These findings suggest that combination PD-1 and LAG-3 inhibition may have potential utility for treatment of other malignancies, such as NSCLC. Furthermore, a Phase I study of cemiplimab and fianlimab in unresectable stage IIIB-C or IV NSCLC (NCT03005782) showed that the combination demonstrated clinical activity with a similar safety profile compared to cemiplimab alone. Given the promising findings observed in SPRINT, RELATIVITY-047, and NCT03005782, the research team believes that dual immune checkpoint blockade with the PD-1 inhibitor cemiplimab plus the LAG-3 inhibitor fianlimab administered before and after thoracic RT, as per the SPRINT approach, has valuable therapeutic potential for LA-NSCLC patients.\n\nTreatment will be administered in three phases as detailed in this registration: (1) three cycles of induction IO, with histology-specific platinum doublet chemotherapy (PDC) added for subjects with PD-L1 TPS \\<50%; (2) thoracic RT (with concurrent PDC recommended for subjects with PD-L1 TPS \\<50%); (3) 13 cycles of consolidation IO.",

Measurements of keloid lesions will be standardized and performed using Verneir Calipers. These are accurate to the nearest 0.01mm in their measurement of all dimensions. Keloid distensibility (hardness) will be measured using a tonometer, a tool that has been adapted for use in systemic sclerosis and can give insight into softening of lesions.\n\nSubjects who meet inclusion criteria for eligibility will undergo Baseline assessments at Week 0, including clinical assessments (number, location and measurements via tonometer and calipers), review of concomitant medications, standardized clinical photography, questionnaires (a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and a Keloid-Quality of Life Index (K-QLI) questionnaire), and additional skin assessments if he/she concurrently has atopic dermatitis (EASI, IGA, BSA and SCORAD will be used to evaluate existing atopic dermatitis). Blood samples and skin biopsies will be collected for mechanistic studies (described below) at various timepoints for RNA, DNA and protein analyses, as well as for analyses of IgE and serum CRP. Two 4.5 mm biopsies will be performed at Baseline: one from a keloid lesion and one from an adjacent non-lesional area.

Patients without evidence of metastatic disease, with tissue remaining from a pre-treatment biopsy, and who are being considered for standard treatment by prostatectomy, will be invited to participate and will be on study for up to 15 months.",
    "detailed_description": "The original design of this protocol was to examine the use of a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding Androgen Receptor (AR), alone or with nivolumab, to induce and/or augment therapeutic T-cells following androgen deprivation in participants with newly diagnosed prostate cancer scheduled to undergo prostatectomy in one of three treatment arms. Based on emerging preclinical data that the timing of PD-1 blockade with the first immunization may be critical, and that combining PD-1 and LAG-3 blockade can improve the anti-tumor efficacy of vaccination in murine models of prostate cancer, the trial was amended to include two additional treatment arms testing the timing of PD-1 blockade and the addition of LAG-3 blockade. All participants will receive treatment with degarelix for 8 weeks prior to prostatectomy. In the first part of the study encompassing the first 3 treatment arms, participants will be also be randomized to receive either no additional treatment, a DNA vaccine encoding AR, or a DNA vaccine encoding AR and nivolumab. The additional arms will randomize patients to receive cemiplimab (PD-1 antagonist) with vaccine or cemiplimab with fianlimab (LAG-3 antagonist) and vaccine, with each agent initiated with the first immunization.\n\nParticipants receiving vaccination will begin that treatment prior to degarelix, based on preclinical findings that this may be a preferred sequence of treatment. The overall goal is to determine whether a DNA vaccine can augment the number of prostate tumor-specific infiltrating CD8+ T cells elicited with androgen deprivation, and whether this might be further augmented by combination with T-cell checkpoint blockade.\n\nBecause these cells should have cytolytic effector function, the primary clinical endpoint is pathological response (pCR and secondarily MRD) at the time of prostatectomy. This endpoint was chosen based on observations from previous clinical trials evaluating androgen deprivation therapies alone in this setting.\n\nSafety will also be a primary objective of the current study, as this vaccine and nivolumab have not been previously used in this early stage population. An additional secondary clinical endpoint will be 1-year PSA progression-free survival, after completion of all therapy, and with evidence of testosterone recovery.\n\nLaboratory and correlative endpoints will include whether vaccination, with or without concurrent T-cell checkpoint blockade, elicits greater numbers of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and whether AR-specific prostate tissue-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and persistent systemic immunity are detectable after treatment with vaccination. Other correlative studies will evaluate FLT PET/CT (Arms 1-3) as an investigational means of specifically identifying tumor infiltration by proliferating T cells as an early marker of treatment response, and whether uptake in other normal tissues is associated with autoimmune toxicity. While this is a relatively small trial, given a focus on correlative endpoints, a phase 2 expansion design was chosen to further evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy if pathological responses are observed in the initial part of the trial. If pathological responses exceeding 20% are observed, this will be considered significantly different from what has been historically observed, and would justify proceeding with future larger studies evaluating these combination approaches in the neoadjuvant stage of prostate cancer.\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\n1. To evaluate the safety of androgen deprivation and pTVG-AR DNA vaccine, alone or in combination with T-cell checkpoint blockade, in patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer\n2. To determine if pathological complete responses or minimal residual disease (MRD) can occur in patients with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation and pTVG-AR, alone or in combination with T-cell checkpoint blockade, prior to definitive surgery\n\nSecondary Clinical Objective:\n\n1. To estimate 1-year PSA progression-free survival (post-prostatectomy)\n2.

    "detailed_description": "Cemiplimab is a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies are proteins naturally found in the blood. A monoclonal antibody is a special antibody that is manufactured as a medication to target specific proteins in the body that may be involved in cancer. Cemiplimab works by blocking programmed death-1 (PD-1), a cell receptor on immune cells. By blocking PD-1, it is expected that the immune cells will attack cancer cells.\n\nThe study is being conducted in participants that have had surgery and radiation therapy for a type of skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell cancer, and who have a risk that this cancer may come back.\n\nThe main purpose of the study is to determine if cemiplimab will prevent cutaneous squamous cell cancer (CSCC) from returning after surgery and radiation. Currently, we know that certain types of CSCC have a high chance of coming back after surgery and radiation. At this time, there is no approved treatment to give patients after surgery and radiation to prevent high-risk CSCC from coming back. We are investigating if the addition of cemiplimab will decrease the chance of these high-risk cancers coming back.\n\nThe study will also investigate if cemiplimab may help participants live for longer.\n\nThe study has two parts. Part 1: participants will receive every 3 weeks via intravenous infusion (drip into a vein) either cemiplimab (study drug) or placebo (similar to the study drug but without active medicine). After 12 weeks of treatment, cemiplimab or placebo will be given every 6 weeks. Part 1 of the study includes a screening period (up to 28 days), a treatment period (approximately 48 weeks), an end of treatment visit (approximately 30 days after completion of study drug treatment period) and a post-treatment follow-up period (approximately up to 5 years or until skin cancer returns or the study ends).\n\nPart 2 of the study is optional and provides the participant with the option to receive cemiplimab if the cancer comes back if the participant was initially receiving placebo. There is no placebo in Part 2 of the study. If the cancer comes back, the study doctor will discuss with participants if they are eligible to participate in the optional part 2 of the study.\n\nPart 2 of the study includes a brief screening period, a treatment period (approximately 96 weeks) and an end of treatment visit (approximately 30 days after the completion of the study drug treatment period).",

An important therapy for AERD is aspirin therapy after desensitization (ADAT). This is an inexpensive and proven therapy to improve the burden of sinus disease in AERD. Aspirin desensitization is the mechanism by which tolerance is induced in AERD patients. This is a 1-2 day outpatient procedure whereby increasing doses of aspirin are administered and the patients invariably experience some degree of hypersensitivity reactions.\n\nIt is important to understand the effect of medications on the aspirin desensitization. It is known that the leukotriene modifier medications decrease the severity of the reactions in AERD. Other treatments such as antihistamines and the biologic agent omalizumab might have an effect on either blocking or blunting reactivity in AERD during desensitization.\n\nDupilumab is a new respiratory biologic approved for atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic asthma and nasal polyposis. As such, it is well situated to be used for many AERD patients whose disease cannot be well controlled. The effect of dupilumab on the aspirin desensitization process and reaction is unknown and is the topic of this investigation.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine the effect of dupilumab on reactions during aspirin challenge/desensitization.",

The purpose of this study is to see if the study medication dupilumab helps prevent those with mild to moderate asthma from having increased asthma symptoms, after being exposed to an experimental rhinovirus inoculation. This is a study about dupilumab which is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of moderate to severe asthma. Dupilumab is a medication that blocks pathways that cause asthmatic inflammation in the lungs, leading to symptoms and worsening lung function. During this study, subjects will be given either dupilumab or placebo and will subsequently be exposed to the the \"common\" cold virus (rhinovirus). The virus that the investigators are using has been safely used before in many studies like this involving thousands of volunteers, and the safe use of the virus in this research study has been reviewed by the FDA. The investigators will track asthma symptoms during the study with lung function tests, questionnaires, specimen collection, biomarkers, and physical exams. For data analysis the investigators will assess the samples collected to determine changes in the treatment groups. The investigators will also asses the symptom scores and deviations from baseline measures for lung function.",
    "detailed_description": "Rhinovirus (RV) is responsible for up to 70-80% of asthmatic exacerbations in children and adolescents requiring urgent care or hospitalizations. Understanding the mechanism by which this otherwise relatively innocuous infection produces asthma exacerbations is essential towards mitigating these episodes. Two theories have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. One is that asthmatics have defective innate and adaptive immune responses to viral respiratory infections, leading to increased viral-associated pathology with an associated enhanced inflammatory response. An alternative - and not mutually exclusive - explanation is that RV indirectly exacerbates an ongoing allergic response to bystander allergens. Dupilumab blocks type 2 inflammatory responses and is known to prevent asthma exacerbations. It both attenuates the reduced innate immunity observed in asthmatics and also reduces the ability to engage a type 2 allergic inflammatory response to bystander allergens. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that RV mediated worsening of asthma will be attenuated in the presence of dupilumab. This study examines cellular and molecular mediators of these interactions, which could help understand the intimate mechanism(s) underlying dupilumab's protective effect in asthmatics.\n\nA total of 60 patients with mild persistent asthma will be enrolled and randomized in this study (30 active treatment and 30 placebo).\n\nThe double-blind, randomized design minimizes any sources of bias. The placebo group provides a reference for the interpretation of study results, so the net effect of dupilumab could be discerned. The dupilumab dose regimen selected for this study (300 mg q2w after an initial loading dose of 600 mg) is consistent with the approved dose for patients with asthma. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on innate antiviral and type 2 inflammatory biomarkers, epithelial barrier repair, and adaptive immune responses following rhinovirus infection in asthmatic patients. The exploratory objectives include evaluating the effect of dupilumab in reducing the severity of rhinovirus-induced respiratory symptoms, its effect on lung function (eg FEV1, FEV1/FVC) and asthma control. As well as evaluating the effect of dupilumab on other biomarkers and viral load. The sample size was selected empirically, informed by similar successful studies conducted in the past. For example, in a previous double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of omalizumab in the prevention of RV-induced asthma exacerbations, a total n of 20 (10 per group in the final analysis) was sufficient to achieve a secondary endpoint based on FEV1/FVC ratio). These data demonstrate the intrinsic power of the viral challenge model. The population included in the current trial has been further enriched (mild to moderate persistent asthmatics, on ICS \u00b1 other long-term controllers).",

In addition, the investigators will correlate improvements in microbial diversity/decreased staph abundance with clinical improvements as assessed via questionnaires and objective/subjective smell function and also as improvements in cellular/immune T2 inflammation as assessed by reduced expression of T2 cytokines/chemokines and eosinophil/eosinophil-derived proteins.",
    "detailed_description": "Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) is an important clinical problem and is associated with profound unmet medical needs given the absence - until recently - of adequate medical therapies. It has an estimated prevalence of 2-4% in the USA and Europe but also has disproportionate burden on quality of life and economic burden.\n\nCRSwNPs is predominantly (in 62-85% of patients) a type 2 (T2) disease, as demonstrated by an IL-4high, IL-5high, IL-13high cytokine signature and prominent infiltration with eosinophils, basophils, and newly recruited mast cells. Another characteristic feature of CRSwNPs is the colonization of the sinonasal space with Staphylococcus aureus (Staph). Staph comprises \\<10% of the bacterial biomass of the healthy nose but infections with this pathogen is observed in the majority of CRSwNP patients and especially in those with asthma comorbidity or AERD.\n\nEvidence exists for an upregulatory vicious circle involving type 2 inflammation promoting an immune deficient state with reduced innate immune responsiveness to staph, leading to colonization/infection with staph and then with the staph producing exotoxins and other pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that promote and exacerbate the T2high state. A central endogenous immune defense to protect against colonization and infection with staph consists of innate immune-derived anti-microbial proteins (AMPs). There are two major families of AMPs, the defensins and the cathelicidins that together comprise \\>2000 proteins. These cationic proteins provide immune defenses against a range of pathogens. Downregulation of the \u00df-defensins (BD)-2 and BD-3 and cathelicidin LL-37 is particularly relevant to atopic dermatitis (AD) and underlies the particular susceptibility of AD skin to colonization and infection with staph. Thus, in AD staph can comprise up to 90% of the bacterial species present on the skin. These AMPs are predominantly expressed in epithelial cells including of the skin but are also expressed by airway epithelial cells (AECs). Sinonasal AECs produce all the \u00df-defensins (BD1-4) and BD1-3 expression is reduced in allergic inflammatory diseases of the airway. In addition to AMPs shared with the dermis, another important AMP, S100A7 (psoriasin) is also uniquely reduced in CRS.\n\nThis diminished expression of \u00df-defensins and cathelicidin in AD has been ascribed to overproduction of IL-4/IL-13. Inhibition of AMP expression in upper airway allergic disease has also been ascribed to these cytokines. In addition to inhibiting its production, IL-4/IL-13 also block the mobilization of BD-3 to the surface of staph. T2 cytokines further promote staph infection in AD by enhancing binding of these pathogens to atopic skin. Finally, IL-4/IL-13 may further enhance susceptibility to infection through their adverse impact on tight junction barrier function, thereby promoting microinvasive disease and access of PAMPs to submucosal targets.\n\nThe final component of the pro-inflammatory vicious circle is the capacity of Staph-derived enterotoxins to feedback to enhance production of T2-associated cytokines, thereby further exacerbating eosinophilic inflammation and the reduced innate immune defense against pathogens. This enhancement of the T2 signature has traditionally been ascribed to the production of superantigens (and antigens) by staph that engage Th2 effector cells residing in the sinuses via their T cell receptor and stimulates their further activation and cytokine secretion. However, staph-derived PAMPs including lipoteichoic acid and staph enterotoxin B (SEB) can also induce secretion of T2-promoting cytokines such as IL-33 and TSLP by engagement of toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and other pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) on AECs.\n\nIn summary CRSwNPs frequently comprises a state in which staph-derived PAMPs exacerbate an already established T2high inflammatory condition, T2-derived cytokines but in particular IL-4 and IL-13 interact with AECs to reduce AMP production, and reduced expression of AMPs promotes the colonization and further infection with staph.\n\nThis pathogenic mechanism is now unambiguously established in atopic dermatitis. This was demonstrated via the ability of blockade of IL-4/IL-13 via administration of anti-IL-4R to decrease Staphylococcus aureus colonization and increase microbial diversity in atopic dermatitis - an effect that strongly correlated with clinical benefit. The investigators propose that a similar molecular mechanism for dupilumab will be observed in CRSwNPs.",

    "detailed_description": "Chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX (5-fluoruracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel is the backbone of modern therapy of metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Generally, the chemotherapy regimen is chosen based on the patient's performance status and ability to tolerate the specific side effect profiles of the two regimens. As many patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma suffer from multiple co-morbidities that develop with the disease, they are often subjected to treatment interruptions, dose reductions, and palliative single-agent therapies. Thus, better treatments are needed for this disease. A treatment modality for many cancer types is represented by immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, over 98% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma are deemed 'cold', which means that they have an uninflamed tumor microenvironment incapable of spurring an immune response during therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In fact, immune checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab (Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte Associated protein 4 blocker) and nivolumab (Programmed Cell Death 1 blocker) have not shown efficacy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma as single agents.\n\nAlterations in the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF appear to sensitize tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitors and may be a surrogate biomarker of efficacy of these compounds. In retrospective studies, immune checkpoint inhibitors in SWI/SNF altered pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma resulted in improved tumor responses and longer progression-free survival and overall survival. In addition, preclinical studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors plus gemcitabine show superior antitumor effects compared to gemcitabine alone in both orthotopic murine pancreatic cancer cell line grafts and in genetically engineered mouse models.\n\nThus, the investigators propose a clinical trial of the immune checkpoint inhibitor cemiplimab plus standard of care gemcitabine to evaluate efficacy and safety of this combination in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma harboring SWI/SNF alterations who did not respond or were intolerant to the standard of care chemotherapies (FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel). The investigators hypothesize that the combination cemiplimab plus gemcitabine will lead to better overall survival, progression free survival, and overall response rate compared to historical controls.",

Cemiplimab is a monoclonal antibody that stimulates the immune system by blocking the PD-1 pathway. Tumors use the PD-1 pathway to escape attacks from the immune system. By blocking the PD-1 pathway, cemiplimab may help the immune system recognize and attack tumor cells. Docetaxel is in a class of medications called taxanes. It stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Ramucirumab is a monoclonal antibody that may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.

    "detailed_description": "1. RATIONAL\n\n   Melanoma with Brain Metastasis Background\n\n   Brain metastases in patients with advanced and metastatic melanoma are a frequent complication and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in this patient population. As the incidence of brain metastases continues to increase in patients with metastatic melanoma, it is urgent that the investigators identify effective therapies.\n\n   Recent data have shown an incidence of brain metastases in \u2264 50% of patients with metastatic melanoma (Chukwueke U et al 2016). Because this is typically a late complication of systemic disease, melanoma-related brain metastases have been associated with significant neurologic morbidity and a poor median overall survival, with treatment, of approximately 9 months (Ramanujam S et al 2015). Factors that predict survival include age, performance status, and the number of brain metastases, which are summarized as the melanoma-specific graded prognostic assessment (Sperduto PW et al 2010).\n\n   Systemic Therapy for Melanoma Patients with Brain Metastases\n\n   Patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma and symptomatic brain metastases (SBM) have a high unmet medical need. On one hand, treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab yields the best results in patients with asymptomatic disease, according to CM204 and ABC studies (Tawbi HA et al 2021)(Long GV et al 2021), but it has worse outcomes for patients with symptomatic disease, according to CM204 study (Tawbi HA et al 2021). On the other hand, targeted therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib yields a high response rate that is independent of the symptomatic status (Davies MA et al 2017) although the durability of these responses is usually short termed, in contrast with immunotherapy (Davies MA et al 2017).\n\n   A phase I clinical trial has demonstrated a promising maintained activity with the combination of cemiplimab and fianlimab in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who were all na\u00efve to anti-PD-1 therapy for advanced disease (n=98). The ORR was 61%, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 15 months (Hamid O et al 2023). The combination is currently being investigated in patients with melanoma at diverse stages (Baramidze A et al 2023)(Panella TJ et al 2023). Additionally, the relativity clinical trial has demonstrated an improvement of PFS with the combination of nivolumab and relatlimab in comparison to nivolumab (Tawbi HA et al 2022), although patients with brain metastases were underrepresented.\n\n   In addition, a previous communication suggests that the treatment with immunotherapy is not as efficacious for patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma and brain metastases previously treated and progressed to targeted therapy (Lau PKH et al 2021).\n\n   The sandwich approach (starting with targeted therapy based in encorafenib and binimetinib followed by dual immune checkpoint blockade without waiting to progression) has been demonstrated that sequencing targeted and immunotherapy is a feasible strategy in the SECOMBIT clinical trial (Ascierto PA et al 2021).\n\n   Recetly, the Spanish Melanoma Group (GEM) has published the results of the EBRAIN/GEM1802 clinical trial, evaluates the treatment with encorafenib and binimetinib (EB) followed by radiotherapy in symptomatic and asymtomatic patients with BRAF mutated melanoma and brain metastases, showing and intracranial objective response of 70.8% and complete response of 10.4%. This clinical trial also explores if radiotherapy after achieving an objective response or stable disease in the brain could improve the intracranial progression free survival (icPFS). Median icPFS and OS were 8.5 and 15.9 months, respectively (8.3 months for icPFS and 13.9 months OS for patients receiving radiotherapy). In conclusion, encorafenib plus binimetinib showed promising clinical benefit in terms of icRR and tolerable safety profile. Sequential radiotherapy is feasible but it does not seem to prolong response (Marquez-Rodas I et al 2024).\n2. HYPOTHESIS For patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma and symptomatic brain metastases, an induction treatment with encorafenib and binimetinib (EB) for about two months (i.e. 8 weeks) followed by cemiplimab plus fianlimab (CF) would allow a 6 month icPFS rate of 40% in comparison to historical control of 20% based on CM204 symptomatic arm (Margolin KA et al 2021).\n3. STUDY TREATMENTS Induction treatment with oral encorafenib 450 mg once daily (QD) + binimetinib 45 mg twice daily (BID)(combination: EB) for approximately two months (i.e. 8 weeks) followed by cemiplimab 350 mg + fianlimab 1600 mg combination every 3 weeks (Q3W)(Combination: CF) administered to patients intravenously (IV) for up to two years. Treatment may be discontinued due to death, PD or non-acceptable toxicity. Encorafenib plus binimetinib should be discontinued at least 72 hours prior to the first dose of cemiplimab plus fianlimab. Rechallenge with encorafenib 450mg QD + binimetinib 45 mg BID will be mandatory for those patients that progress under CF, with the exception of patients with intracranial response or stabilization and only extracranial PD in which case CF could be continued at the physician criteria. In the case of continuing treatment with CF, tumor assessment should be repeated after 8 weeks to confirm the progression and the benefit of CF to the brain.\n4. OBJECTIVES Primary Objectives To evaluate the 6 month intracranial progression-free survival (icPFS) proportion of Encorafenib plus Binimetinib followed by Cemiplimab plus Fianlimab in patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma and symptomatic brain metastases.\n\n   Secondary Efficacy Objectives\n\n   To assess the following efficacy endpoints:\n   * 12 month icPFS rate\n   * Intracraneal PFS (icPFS)\n   * Extracraneal PFS (ecPFS)\n   * Global PFS (PFS)\n   * Overall survival (OS)\n   * Intracranial objective response rate (icORR) at 2 and 6 months\n   * Extracraneal ORR (ecORR) at 2 and 6 months\n   * Basal Quality of Life (QoL), at 2 and 6 months\n   * Basal systemic steroids decrease at 2 and 6 months\n   * Modified Barthel index improvement at 2 and 6 months Secondary Safety Objectives To assess the following the safety profile of the combination through continuous assessment of Adverse events (AE) and Treatment-related AEs (TRAEs).\n\n   Secondary Exploratory Objectives To evaluate the correlation between biomarkers and the clinical outcomes of treatment with encorafenib plus binimetinib followed by cemiplimab plus fianlimab in patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma and symptomatic brain metastases.\n5. ENDPOINTS The primary endpoint for ENCEFALO is the 6 month intracranial progression-free survival (icPFS), defined as the proportion of patients alive and free of icPFS according to modified RECIST criteria at 6 month evaluation (week 24 +/- 3 weeks) after the start of study treatment. The icPFS will be assessed locally by investigators.\n\n   Secondary Efficacy Endpoints\n   * 12-months icPFS: Percentage of patients free of icPFS according to modified RECIST criteria at 12 month evaluation (week 48 +/- 3 weeks).\n   * icPFS locally assessed according to modified RECIST criteria, median and global curve estimated by kaplan meier method\n   * ecPFS locally assessed according to modified RECIST criteria, median and global curve estimated by kaplan meier method\n   * PFS locally assessed according to modified RECIST criteria, median and global curve estimated by kaplan meier method\n   * OS locally assessed, median and global curve estimated by kaplan meier method\n   * Change in patient reported outcomes in Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), assessed through the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) version 3.\n   * Changes in Barthel score from baseline.\n   * Change in systemic steroids usage from baseline. Secondary Safety Endpoints\n\n   Type, incidence, frequency, severity and relation to the treatment of reported adverse events, physical examinations and laboratory tests:\n   * Frequency and severity of adverse events assessed by NCI CTCAE v5.0.\n   * Frequency of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) assessed by NCI CTCAE v5.0.\n   * Frequency of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation. Secondary Exploratory Endpoints\n   * Expression of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood samples at several time points throughout the study treatment.\n   * Presence of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMDCs) in blood samples at several time points throughout the study treatment.\n6. STUDY DESIGN\n\n   The trial will enroll competitively up to 33 patients. The study will enroll the first 18 patients and monitor for progression at 6 months (24-weeks assessment). If there are 4 or less patients free of progression at the 6-months tumor assessment the accrual will be closed. Otherwise, a minimum of 15 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 33 evaluable patients. All patients will have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of unresectable metastatic BRAF-mutated melanoma, with one or more brain metastases with a diameter of 5 to 50 mm and symptomatology associated with the disease, defined as symptom related with intracranial hypertension or cognitive impairment. all patients will be \u2265 18 years and ECOG PS 0-2 (See Section 8 for further detail on eligibility).\n\n   The design includes a screening phase in which patient eligibility is addressed, a treatment phase, and a follow-up phase.\n\n   Study treatment will begin as soon as possible after signing the informed consent and inclusion will be completed as is indicated in protocol.\n\n   All enrolled patients will receive an induction treatment with oral encorafenib 450 mg once daily (QD) + binimetinib 45 mg twice daily (BID)(combination: EB) for approximately two months (i.e. 8 weeks) followed by cemiplimab 350 mg + fianlimab 1600 mg combination every 3 weeks (Q3W)(Combination: CF) administered to patients intravenously (IV) for up to 2 years. Treatment may be discontinued due to death, PD or non-acceptable toxicity\n\n   . Rechallenge with encorafenib 450mg QD + binimetinib 45 mg BID will be mandatory for those patients that progress under CF, with the exception of patients with intracranial response or stabilization and only extracranial PD in which case CF could be continued at the physician criteria. In the case of continuing treatment with CF, tumor assessment should be repeated after 8 weeks, and no longer, to confirm the progression and the brain benefit.\n\n   The primary endpoint is efficacy determined by the 6-month icPFS proportion. All patients will undergo periodic mandatory tumor assessments by CT or MRI scan every 8 weeks \u00b1 7 days for the first year from the start of study treatment and recommended every 12 weeks \u00b1 7 days afterwards until progression or patient withdrawal. Further CT/MRI scans could be performed upon suspicion of disease progression according to standard clinical practice and physician criteria. Safety will be assessed at every visit through continuous monitoring of signs and symptoms and periodic laboratory analysis.\n7. SAMPLE SIZE Using Simon's two-stage Minimax design (Simon R 1989), assuming the null hypothesis as the rate of patients not progressing in the brain at 6 months (defined as a success) is about 20% (Tawbi et al. 2021), will be tested against a one-sided alternative (40%). In the first stage Simon's two-stage minimax design, 18 patients will be accrued. If there are \u22644 successes (defined as patients not progressing at 6 months) in these 18 patients, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, a minimum of 15 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 33 evaluable patients.",

    "brief_summary": "Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have diabetic macular edema.\n\nDiabetic macular edema (DME) is a diabetes-related eye disorder. In DME, the macula, which is the central part of the retina at the back of the eye, swells up resulting in vision problems. This happens due to leakage of fluid from damaged blood vessels.\n\nThe study treatment, 8 milligram (mg) aflibercept is injected into the eye. It works by blocking a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which causes abnormal growth and leakage of blood vessels at the back of the eye.\n\nA lower dose of aflibercept (2 mg) is already approved for the treatment of DME. Based on the findings of another study, the higher dose of aflibercept (8 mg) is expected to reduce the frequency of injections required for treating DME while being equally safe and working as well as the lower dose. The higher dose could make it easier to treat DME and improve quality of life for people with DME.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn if high-dose (8 mg) aflibercept given every 16 weeks works as well as low-dose (2 mg) aflibercept given every 8 weeks in Chinese participants.\n\nFor this, the researchers will compare the change in participants' 'best corrected visual acuity' (BCVA) after 48 weeks of starting the treatment. BCVA is the clearest vision a participant can have with the help of corrective lenses, such as glasses. It will be measured by the number of letters the participant can read on an eye chart. This is known as their Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letter score.\n\nParticipants will be randomly (by chance) assigned to one of two treatment groups to receive study treatment as an injection into the eye up to Week 56:\n\n* 2 mg aflibercept every 8 weeks after receiving 5 initial monthly doses\n* 8 mg aflibercept every 16 weeks after receiving 3 initial monthly doses\n\nEach participant will be in the study for around 63 weeks with up to 18 visits to the study site. This includes:\n\n* one visit up to 21 days before the treatment starts during which the doctors will confirm that the participant can take part in the study\n* 16 visits during which the treatment will be given. Most of these visits will have a gap of 4 weeks except for one visit that will happen a few days after the previous visit\n* one visit 4 weeks after the treatment ends\n\nDuring the study, the doctors and their study team will:\n\n* check the participants' vision and their overall eye health using different eye tests\n* check participants' health by performing tests such as blood and urine tests\n* ask the participants questions about the disease and study treatment and how these impact their quality of life\n* ask the participants what adverse events they are having An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events, irrespective of whether they think they are related to the study treatment.\n\nAccess to study treatment after the end of this study is not planned. Participants can switch to available approved treatments for DME.",
    "detailed_description": "EYLEA (aflibercept 40 mg/mL solution for injection) at a dosage level of 2 mg administered intravitreally (IVT) is approved in over 100 countries for the treatment of DME. Despite the proven efficacy and safety of EYLEA in patients with DME, there remains an unmet need for alternative therapies that can decrease the burden of DME treatment via a reduction in the required frequency of IVT injections, while improving visual and anatomic outcomes. The overall one and two year results of PHOTON, a global phase 2/3 trial evaluating high dose (HD or 8 mg) aflibercept in participants with center-involved diabetic macular edema (DME), demonstrate the benefit of HD aflibercept for reducing the frequency of injections required for the treatment of DME while providing visual and anatomic outcomes non-inferior to and a safety profile indistinguishable from EYLEA, 2 mg aflibercept, the established standard of care for the treatment of DME. The observed reduction in the number of HD aflibercept injections required for the treatment of DME over 2 years in PHOTON is expected to translate into the benefit of reducing the burden of treatment and, thereby improving the quality of life for DME patients, their caregivers and health care providers. This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of HD aflibercept in Chinese participants with DME over 60 weeks with the primary objective of achieving non-inferior best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) with an extended dosing interval (every 16 weeks after 3 initial monthly injections) vs. 2 mg aflibercept (every 8 weeks after 5 initial monthly injections) similar to the results obtained in PHOTON. This study is designed to support the registration of HD aflibercept for the treatment of DME in China.\n\nPrimary Objective: The primary objective of the study is to determine if treatment with HD aflibercept at intervals of 16 weeks provides non-inferior best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) compared to 2 mg aflibercept dosed every 8 weeks in Chinese participants\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n* To determine the effect of HD aflibercept vs. 2 mg aflibercept on anatomic and other visual measures of response;\n* To evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics (PK) of HD aflibercept in Chinese participants.\n\nPrimary endpoint:\n\n* Change from baseline in BCVA by ETDRS letter score at Week 48\n\nSecondary endpoints:\n\n* Change from baseline in BCVA by ETDRS letter score at Week 60\n* Participants gaining \u226515 letters at Week 48 and Week 60\n* Participants achieving an ETDRS letter score of at least 69 (approximate 20/40 Snellen equivalent) at Week 48\n* Participants with no IRF and/or no SRF in the center subfield at Week 48\n* Change from baseline in central subfield thickness (CST) at Week 48\n* Change from baseline in leakage on fluorescein angiography (FA) at Week 48\n* Change from baseline in National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ) total score at Week 48\n* Occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) through Weeks 48 and 60\n* Participants developing a treatment-emergent ADA response or Nabs to aflibercept through EOS at Week 60\n* Systemic exposure to aflibercept as assessed by plasma concentrations of free, adjusted bound, and total aflibercept from baseline through Week 48 This study is a phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-masked, active-controlled study in Chinese participants with DME involving the center of the macula to investigate the efficacy and safety of HD aflibercept versus 2 mg aflibercept.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to determine if treatment with HD aflibercept at 16 week intervals provides non-inferior BCVA compared to 2 mg aflibercept dosed every 8 weeks in Chinese participants.\n\n322 eligible participants randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the following 2 treatment groups:\n\n1. 2q8: 2 mg aflibercept every 8 weeks following 5 initial monthly doses (n=161) and\n2. HDq16: HD aflibercept every 16 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses (n=161). The study consists of a screening period, a treatment period, and an end of study (EOS) visit at Week 60. The study duration for a participant is approximately 63 weeks. The EOS is defined as the last visit of the last participant. No study treatment will be administered at the EOS visit at Week 60.\n\nHD aflibercept is the sponsor's study intervention under investigation. The following intervention groups are included in the study:\n\n* 2 mg aflibercept every 8 weeks (2q8)\n* 8 mg aflibercept every 16 weeks (HDq16)",

    "brief_summary": "The Glo-BNHL trial is trying to find better medicines for children and young people with B-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL) that does not go away (refractory B-NHL) or does but comes back again (relapsed B-NHL). B-NHL is a type of cancer that develops inside or outside of lymph nodes (glands) and organs such as the liver or spleen. Examples of B-NHL are Burkitt Lymphoma and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma, which may be other names used to describe this type of cancer. It is very difficult to cure relapsed or refractory B-NHL. The medicines used now are very powerful with many side effects and only cure around 30 in every 100 children treated. It is very important that investigators quickly find better medicines for these children and young people.\n\nThe Glo-BNHL trial will include three groups of children and young people, each given a new medicine (either alone or with chemotherapy). The investigators are looking to make sure the new medicines are safe and that they work to treat the cancer. If the medicine in one group does not work for a child in the trial, then they may be able to join a different group to have another new medicine.\n\nExperts from around the world will carefully pick the medicines most likely to be helpful to be part of the trial. If one of the new medicines seems not to be working as well as hoped then the investigators will take it out of the trial as soon as possible. This will let other new medicines be added to the trial and tested. If a medicine does seem to be working well, then it will continue in the trial to make sure it really is the most useful medicine available.\n\nChildren from around the world will be invited to take part in the trial. The investigators will then check on them for at least two years after they finish the trial treatment to look for possible side effects of the new medicine.",
    "detailed_description": "Glo-BNHL is an adaptive prospective international multicentre platform clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel agents for the treatment of children, adolescents, and young adults with relapsed and/or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (r/r BNHL). The trial is designed to generate sufficient evidence to potentially be practice-changing in this rare cancer setting. With the trial incorporating an initial stage evaluating efficacy followed potentially by an expansion stage to provide confirmatory analysis, the trial could be considered to be phase II/III.\n\nNovel agents will be prioritised for inclusion in the platform according to an overarching prioritisation list and a robust systematic scientific assessment, performed by the international Trial Steering Committee (TSC).\n\nThe platform consists of three parallel treatment arms, each one investigating a different novel agent in a group of patients. The platform allows the testing of a pipeline of novel agents in each treatment arm consecutively. Patients in the platform may be enrolled into any of the available treatment arms for which they are eligible. The classes of novel agents prioritised for inclusion at the initiation of the trial are:\n\n* Treatment Arm I: Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs)\n* Treatment Arm II: Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) with standard chemotherapy\n* Treatment Arm III: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells\n\nThe platform trial has an adaptive Bayesian design that facilitates efficient GO/NoGO decisions relevant to the target population enrolled in each treatment arm. The Bayesian approach estimates the probability that a novel agent is clinically effective and enables decision-making even with small numbers of patients. It can also incorporate prior knowledge, thereby maximising the utility of all available data in this rare population. It facilitates continuous evaluation of any novel agent as the sample size increases.\n\nFurthermore it allows for the discontinuation of an agent if the observed trial data demonstrate a high probability that the novel agent is ineffective at any time, allowing the next agent in the pipeline to be introduced. If the prioritisation of classes of novel agents by the TSC changes, treatment arms can be amended, added, or removed to reflect this. Not all Treatment Arms will necessarily be open to recruitment at all times.",

The drug works by controlling allergic inflammation of the esophagus. The esophagus is a food pipe that transfers food from the mouth into the stomach. Participants with EoE have dysfunction of the muscle of the esophagus (impaired peristalsis) that is not favorable for the transport function.\n\nMain question this study aims to answer is: Whether Dupilumab helps improve muscle activity of the esophagus in participants with EOE?\n\nParticipants will:\n\nTake Dupilumab every week for 12 weeks. Visit the clinic before and after starting the medication. Keep a diary of symptoms.",
    "detailed_description": "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EOE) is an allergic inflammation of the mucosa of the esophagus. One or more of the common food constituents (milk, egg, soy, wheat, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish) in a susceptible host (people with history of atopic dermatitis or asthma) is the cause of allergic inflammation in EOE. It is a Th-2 immune cell mediated allergic inflammation that leads to infiltration of the esophageal mucosa with eosinophils (\\> 15/high power field/HPF), which leads to submucosal fibrosis, esophageal stricture, narrow esophageal lumen, and reduced distensibility of the esophagus. Patients present with symptoms of dysphagia, food impaction, heartburn, and other non-descript symptoms. The condition can start in childhood and continue in adulthood; however, patients may present at any age. Current incidence estimates range from 5 to 10 cases per 100,000, and current prevalence estimates range from 0.5 to 1 case per 10001. Some of the EOE patients respond to acid inhibition therapy and it may be that acid reflux is the cause of EOE in some patients.\n\nThe inflammatory damage to the esophageal epithelium results in symptoms of esophageal dysfunction, such as dysphagia. Chronic inflammation of the esophagus may also lead to remodeling, stricture formation, and fibrosis6. The fibrotic aspect of progressed disease is not well understood, and whether or not this can be reversed with treatment is unknown. Current therapeutic approaches include chronic dietary elimination, swallowed topical formulation of corticosteroids and esophageal dilation. Emergency endoscopy for prolonged and/or painful food impaction is associated with a risk of severe esophageal injury, and it does not alter the underlying pathogenesis or progression of the disease. Although swallowed topical corticosteroids have been reported in clinical trials to induce partial clinical responses and histologic remission, they are not uniformly effective and can be associated with fungal infections as well as disease recurrence after discontinuation. Studies shows that Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL4 and IL13 is an effective treatment in patients with EOE.\n\nFew years ago, the investigators observed an additional mechanism of dysphagia in EOE patients, which relates to the esophageal motor function. The latter is best assessed by esophageal manometry study, which is normal in the majority (80%) of EOE patients. However, esophageal manometry records only the function of inner, i.e., circular muscle layer of the esophagus, which is only 50% of the total esophageal muscles mass (muscularis propria). The other 50%, i.e., longitudinal muscle is the outer of the 2 muscle layers of the esophagus. A series of studies from my laboratory reveal that the longitudinal muscle layer is responsible for the descending relaxation of the peristaltic reflex. Descending relaxation is critical because it allows esophagus to distend and bolus to proceed in aboral direction with minimal resistance to the flow of swallowed contents. The investigators found that patients with EOE have, 1) dysfunctional longitudinal muscle which manifests as a lower amplitude of contraction as compared to normal subjects and, 2) temporal discoordination between the contractions of the two muscle layers15. Both of the above scenarios can lead to impaired descending relaxation that can results in a smaller luminal CSA of the esophagus during peristalsis as compared to normal subject, which will appear as a narrow lumen esophagus on the barium swallow study, a scenario similar to an esophageal stricture, well described in patients with EOE. A narrow lumen esophagus will result in resistance to the passage of bolus or in other words difficulty swallowing (dysphagia).\n\nPatients with EOE have reduced distensibility of the esophagus, as measured by Endoflip technique. The Endoflip study requires placement of a bag inside the esophagus and distending it with saline to measure pressure and the bag luminal CSA. While Endoflip is an important advancement to measure the luminal CSA, it does not record distensibility under physiological condition of swallowing, i.e., swallow-induced peristalsis. Using intraluminal impedance technique, the investigators have pioneered a methodology to measure the luminal CSA during peristalsis. Using above methodology, the investigators found that in many participant groups, i.e., nutcracker esophagus, esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction and functional dysphagia, the luminal CSA during peristalsis is significantly smaller as compared to normal healthy subjects. The luminal CSA ahead of contraction during peristalsis is an indirect measure of the descending relaxation of the peristaltic reflex. Recent studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine and Gastroenterology show that a 24-week treatment with Dupilumab leads to an approximately 50% reduction in dysphagia symptoms, \\>90% reduction in the eosinophil count, 70% reduction in the histologic scoring system and 18% improvement in the esophageal distensibility. The goal of the study is to determine if treatment with Dupilumab will result in reversal of the longitudinal muscle dysfunction during peristalsis seen in patients with EOE.\n\nThe Dupilumab is an FDA approved study for the treatment of EOE. The current investigation is not intended to support, 1) a significant change in the advertising for the drug, 2) does not involve a change of route of administration, dose, participant population, or other factor that significantly increases the risk (or decreases the acceptability of the risk) associated with the use of the drug product. The investigation will be conducted in compliance with the requirements for review by an IRB and with the requirements for informed consent. 3) A previously reported study has showed a significant inflammation reduction in 60% EoE patients when taking Dupilumab for 12 weeks. This study aims to study its effects on restoring peristalsis in EoE participants when taken for 12 weeks. 4) Participants after study completion will be continuing standard treatment guidelines as indicated by the study PI or participant's physician.",

    "detailed_description": "This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase Ib trial of ASP8374 plus cemiplimab among recurrent malignant glioma participants.\n\nInitially, eligible participants will enroll to Cohort 1 which will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ASP8374 when combined with cemiplimab among recurrent malignant glioma participants using a 3+3 design.\n\nUpon determination of the MTD/RP2D of ASP8374 plus cemiplimab in Cohort 1, a dose expansion will be performed in which eligible participants who are candidates for surgical resection will enroll to Cohort 2 and will be randomized into one of two treatment groups (2A-2B).\n\nGroup 2A: IV ASP8374 plus cemiplimab within 14\u00b1 5 days prior to surgery at the MTD/RP2D established in Cohort 1.\n\nGroup 2B: No immune checkpoint therapy prior to surgery.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved ASP8374 as a treatment for any disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved cemiplimab for recurrent malignant glioma but it has been approved for other uses.\n\nThe research study procedures include: screening for eligibility, then study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits. Participants will receive study treatment for up to two years and will be followed for their tumor's response, whether or not their disease gets worse, and for side effects.\n\nIt is expected that about 24 people will take part in this research study. At least 6 in cohort 1 and 18 in cohort 2.\n\nPharmaceutical company Astellas is supporting this research study by providing study funding and study drug, ASP8374 and Regeneron is supporting this research by providing study drug cemiplimab.",
