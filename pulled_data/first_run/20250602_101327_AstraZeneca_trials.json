Up to 3 dose level combinations of selumetinib and olaparib will be tested. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of each study drugs. Each new group will receive a higher dose of either selumetinib or olaparib study drugs than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose combination of the study drugs is found.\n\nIf you are enrolled in Phase 2, you will receive the highest study drug combination that was tolerated in Phase 1.\n\nStudy Drug Administration:\n\nEach study cycle is 28 days.\n\nYou will take both selumetinib and olaparib by mouth 2 times each day, about 12 hours apart (1 dose in the morning, 1 dose in the evening). You should fast (have nothing to eat or drink except water) for at least 2 hours before and 1 hour after your dose. If you vomit or miss a dose, you should not retake the dose. Wait and take your next scheduled dose.\n\nDepending on the dose level of selumetinib you are receiving, you may only take the study drug on Days 1-5 of each week. The study doctor will tell you how often you should take selumetinib.\n\nYou will be given a study drug diary to record when you take each dose. The study staff will show you how to fill it out.\n\nYou will wait to take your morning dose of study drugs at the clinic on certain days.

In addition, through genetic testing of the blood or tumor, an altered gene has been found that suggests the tumor may not be able to repair its genetic material (DNA) when it becomes damaged.\n* This aspect of the cancer may cause it to be more sensitive - that is, more effectively killed by certain types of drugs such as the study agent being evaluated in this trial, Olaparib.\n\n  * Olaparib is a type of drug known as a PARP inhibitor. Some types of breast cancer and ovarian cancer share some basic features that make them sensitive to similar treatments. Information from those other research studies suggests that this drug may help to treat metastatic breast cancer.\n\n    * This study will evaluate whether olaparib is effective in breast cancer patients whose tumor has a mutation in one of the other genes that function with BRCA1 and BRCA2 to repair damaged DNA .This mutation may have been inherited from a parent, or may have developed only in the tumor.\n    * This study will also evaluate whether olaparib is effective in breast cancer patients whose tumor has a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 that was acquired by the tumor, but not inherited.",
    "detailed_description": "* This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. \"Investigational\" means that the study drug, Olaparib, is being studied for use in this setting and the research doctors are trying to learn more about it-the side effects it may cause and if the drug is effective in treating this type of cancer.\n* What is a DNA repair gene mutation?\n\n  -- In order to survive, all cells, even cancer cells, must be able to repair their genetic material (DNA) when it gets damaged. A mutation is an alteration or change in a gene- either inherited from a parent or acquired over time- that prevents the gene from working properly. Faulty genes (or genes that carry a mutation) have been linked to increased risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.\n* What is Olaparib?\n\n  * Olaparib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing. Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor which means that it blocks an enzyme (proteins that help chemical reactions in the body occur) in cells called PARP. PARP helps repair DNA when it becomes damaged. It has been shown that the tumors in individuals who have inherited or acquired a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes are often sensitive to killing by PARP inhibitors.\n  * In normal cells and many other tumors, repair of damage to the DNA requires pathways of genes that work with BRCA1 and BRCA2. Therefore, when a drug that inhibits PARP from working is given to people with a BRCA mutation, or a defect in another gene that works with BRCA1 and BRCA2, both ways of repairing damaged DNA no longer work. The combined effect of knocking out both DNA repair mechanisms is so severe that the cancer cells could die. This might stop the growth of type of breast cancer, but this is not known.\n  * The FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Olaparib for use in advanced ovarian cancer with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Olaparib is not approved for breast cancer.",

    "brief_summary": "Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) and Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). \"Advanced\" usually means that the cancer keeps growing even with treatment. The cancer may also be \"metastatic\", which means that it has spread to other parts of the body or the surrounding tissue.\n\nThe study drug, Datopotamab deruxtecan, is designed to work by attaching to the tumor cells and stopping the tumor growth. Datopotamab deruxtecan is also known as Dato-DXd.\n\nIn this study, the researchers want to find out how well Dato-DXd works to stop tumors from growing in Chinese participants with NCSLC or TNBC. This is the first time Dato-DXd is being studied in Chinese population.\n\nParticipants in this study will get Dato-DXd through a needle as an injection. They will get 1 dose of Dato-DXd every 3 weeks until their cancer gets worse or they leave the study for another reason.\n\nParticipants will visit their study sites at least once every 3 weeks for as long as they are in the study. The study doctors will take blood samples every 3 weeks and take images of the participants' tumors every 6 weeks until the participant leaves the study.",
    "detailed_description": "This is a Phase 1/Phase 2, multicentre, open-label, multiple-cohort study, which is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, Pharmacokinetic, and immunogenicity of Dato-DXd in adult Chinese participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumours. It is a single-arm study with no blinding.\n\nThis study is divided into different cohorts. Participants of the same cohort are with the same tumour type. The starting cohorts are Cohort 1 (NSCLC) and Cohort 2 (TNBC). Future cohorts will consist of other advanced or metastatic solid tumour types, including, but not limited to, advanced/unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma or urothelial carcinoma that is refractory or intolerant to SoC therapy or for which no Standard of Care therapy is available.\n\nCohort 1 and Cohort 2 will be prioritised for immediate enrolment and the protocol will be amended as needed for the future cohorts.\n\nCohort 1: The target population of Cohort 1 is adult Chinese participants with advanced or metastatic NSCLC with or without actionable genomic alterations(AGAs) (ie, alterations in genes with approved therapies, such as EGFR, ALK, or other known AGAs).\n\nEligible participants without AGAs will have been previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody either in combination or sequentially. Participants without AGAs who received anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody as frontline therapy may have received the combination of platinum-based chemotherapy and anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody in the second-line setting.\n\nEligible participants with AGAs will have been previously treated with one or two prior lines of applicable targeted therapy that is approved for the participant's genomic alteration and platinum-based chemotherapy as the only prior line of cytotoxic therapy. Participants with AGAs may have received up to one anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody treatment alone or in combination with chemotherapy.\n\nA total of approximately 40 eligible participants in China will be enrolled in this cohort, including approximately 6 participants with AGAs.\n\nCohort 2: The target population of Cohort 2 is adult Chinese participants with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC who have received at least 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced breast cancer, counting the (neo)adjuvant therapy as a prior chemotherapy regimen if progression occurred within 12 months after completion of the therapy (DFI \u2264 12 months).\n\nA total of approximately 78 eligible participants in China will be enrolled in this cohort. Cohort 2 will enroll at most around 20% (approximately N=15) of enrolled participants with a DFI \u2264 12 months.\n\nEnrolled participants will be treated with Dato-DXd at 6.0 mg/kg via an IV infusion on Day 1,every 3 weeks.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to estimate the effectiveness of Dato-DXd by assessment of confirmed ORR by independent central review.",

    "detailed_description": "This is a prospective, open label, multicentre, randomised phase II clinical trial. An adaptive trial design is proposed to allow ineffective treatments to be discontinued early, and to potentially add novel treatment arms as the trial progresses.\n\nPatients will initially receive standard chemotherapy for their locally advanced or metastatic oesophago-gastric adenocarcinoma, according to local practice based upon their HER-2 status (tested locally). In order to be eligible for trial entry, HER-2 negative patients should have received a platinum-fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy doublet of either cisplatin + capecitaine (CX), oxaliplatin + capecitabine (CAPOX), or 5FU + oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) (Arm A), whilst HER-2 positive patients (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+ and FISH positive) should have received cisplatin in combination with either capecitabine or 5-FU (CX or CF) plus trastuzumab chemotherapy (Arm B). Potentially eligible patients will be registered with the trials office whilst undergoing first line chemotherapy.\n\nPatients will become eligible for trial recruitment and randomisation after 18 weeks standard chemotherapy with stable disease (SD) or better on the end-of-treatment CT scan. Please note: if your patient has been receiving a regimen delivered every three weeks (e.g. CX) they should have completed 6 cycles. If your patient has been receiving a regimen delivered every 2 weeks (e.g. FOLFOX) they should have received 9 cycles of treatment. Eligible patients will then be randomised according to HER-2 status as follows:\n\n* HER-2 positive patients (\\~20%) will be assigned maintenance single-agent trastuzumab (current UK standard)\n* HER-2 negative patients (\\~80%) will be randomised 1:1 between surveillance (current UK standard) and maintenance capecitabine.\n\nPatients will be stratified according to: centre region, disease extent and performance status (0 versus 1 versus 2).\n\nReview of patients will occur every 4 weeks in the surveillance arm. In maintenance therapy arms, patients will be reviewed every 3 or every 4 weeks depending upon the treatment strategy. CT assessments of response will occur every 12 weeks (3 months) in all arms of the trial. Treatment will be continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal for another reason.\n\nThe trial is being run from the RM GI and Lymphoma CTU with Professor David Cunningham as the Chief Investigator (CI). Effective arms in the phase II portion of the trial may be taken forward into a phase III maintenance trial powered for overall survival. It is also hoped that, as more robust data becomes available for other biomarker-selected populations (e.g. MET-positive, FGFR-amplified), it may be possible to amend the overall trial design to incorporate these biomarker-targeted maintenance therapies in the HER-2 negative population.",

The study has been designed to allow an investigation of the optimal combination dose and schedule whilst ensuring the safety of patients with intensive safety monitoring. There are three main parts to this study; Part A, Combination dose finding and Parts B and D, Dose expansion. Part C, AZD6094 dose finding sub-study in advanced solid tumour patients is ongoing in Japan.\n\nAZD9291 (osimertinib) is a potent irreversible inhibitor of both the single epidermal growth factor receptor sensitising mutation positive (EGFRm+) (tyrosine kinase inhibitor \\[TKI\\] sensitivity-conferring mutation) and dual EGFRm+/T790M+ (TKI resistance-conferring mutation) receptor forms of EGFR. AZD9291 therefore has the potential to provide clinical benefit to patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring both the single sensitivity mutations and the resistance mutation following prior therapy with an EGFR TKI. AZD9291 (osimertinib) was awarded FDA accelerated approval in November 2015, followed by conditional approval in the EU, full approval in Japan and additional markets in 2016, for the treatment of patients with EGFR T790M+ NSCLC who have progressed on or after EGFR TKI therapy.\n\nEnrolment into the patient cohort that evaluated AZD9291 treatment in combination with MEDI4736 as 1st line treatment has been terminated due to an increased incidence of ILD-like events (interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis), and is no longer being evaluated in this study.\n\n.",

Two thirds of patients (Arm B) will go on to receive a further 5 cycles (every 21 days) of R-CHOP with Acalabrutinib. Acalabrutinib will be taken orally twice daily continuously in 21 day cycles.\n\nOne third of patients (Arm A) will continue with 5 cycles of R-CHOP.\n\nPatients will be followed up initially for 24 months and then for disease status and survival until 114 progression events have been observed.",
    "detailed_description": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common of the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Whilst the majority of patients will respond well to conventional treatment (R-CHOP - rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone), a significant number of patients lymphoma will not respond to initial therapy or their disease will return after completion of therapy. In a number of B-cell diseases an enzyme called, Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) prevents death of tumour cells, including in DLBCL. Acalabrutinib is an orally active BTK-inhibitor and it is thought that stopping BTK being activated may help in treating B-cell diseases. It is hypothesised that the addition of Acalabrutinib to standard R-CHOP immunochemotherapy may improve outcomes of patients with DLBCL.\n\nREMoDL-A is a randomised, phase II, open label, multicentre study that will be open in up to 50 centres. Up to 553 patients (453 randomised) will be recruited.\n\nFollowing informed consent all patients will receive 1 cycle of conventional R-CHOP chemotherapy. At the same time the diagnostic pathology block will be sent for molecular profiling by the Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service (HMDS). The delivery of the first cycle of R-CHOP will allow a sufficient interval for real time determination of molecular phenotype. Patients whose biopsies yield sufficient tumour material for profiling will be randomised 2:1 in favour of the experimental arm (R-CHOP + acalabrutinib).\n\nThe primary objective will be to establish if combining acalabrutinib with R-CHOP improves efficacy, compared to R-CHOP alone, for the treatment of previously untreated patients with DLBCL to a degree that justifies further development of this approach.",

Osimertinib will be held for 3 days before the first dose of radiation and resumed 3 days after the last dose.\n\nAfter radiation, all patients will continue osimertinib therapy. If subsequently there is any evidence of progression, there will be an assessment of whether a repeat course of radiation is feasible. If it is feasible to repeat SABR to sites of progression, this will be performed and osimertinib resumed. If SABR is not possible, then a change in systemic therapy will be required.",

    "detailed_description": "Cancer genetic testing has become a standard evidence-based practice, with established risk reduction and cancer screening guidelines for genetic carriers. With FDA approval for PARP inhibitors in patients with advanced breast, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancer, there is an additional therapeutic rationale for testing all breast, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancer patients for germline genetic mutations. Yet, access to genetic specialists is limited in many area, and the traditional model of pre- and post-test counseling with a genetic professional will not support the rising indications for cancer genetic testing. Thus, there is an urgent need to consider alternative delivery models to increase access and uptake of testing, while maintaining adequate patient outcomes.\n\nThis study aims to assess if traditional pre-test (visit 1) and post-test (visit 2: disclosure) counseling delivered by a genetic counselor can be replaced with a self-directed web-based eHealth intervention to provide critical data to inform optimal ways to deliver cancer genetic testing in patients with breast, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancer, while maintaining quality of care and favorable cognitive, affective and behavioral outcomes.\n\nSpecific Aim 1: To determine if web-based eHealth delivery of pre-test and/or post-test counseling can provide equal or improved cognitive and affective short-term and 6-month outcomes as compared to the two-visit standard of care delivery model with a genetic counselor. The investigator's primary outcomes will be changes in knowledge and anxiety. Secondary outcomes will include uptake of testing, depression, cancer specific distress, uncertainty and health behaviors and provider time.",

    "detailed_description": "Initially, patients with EGFR mutation positive NSCLC respond well to osimertinib, a third generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), but eventually progress. Upon progression, three main resistance mechanisms can be found (1, 2): 1) alteration of the drug target by secondary or tertiary EGFR mutations (e.g. C797S mutation in the EGFR kinase domain), 2) alteration of downstream signal transduction proteins (e.g. KRAS mutation / amplification) and 3) bypass track resistance like MET or HER2 amplification. A fourth, less frequent, mechanism involves morphological alterations: dedifferentiation by epidermal-mesenchymal transition (EMT) or change to small-cell-lung carcinoma (SCLC), including RB1 loss.\n\nNew therapeutic strategies are being developed to target these resistance mechanisms and reports have been published about successful treatment of HER2 and MET amplification. Drugs targeting the C797S mutation are entering the clinic.\n\nNext Generation Sequence (NGS) technology rapidly evolves and it is now feasible to analyse broad panels of genetic alterations in tumor tissue as well as in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).\n\nctDNA based T790M detection is a valid method to test for resistance to first or second generation EGFR TKI's and the ctDNA based technique is increasingly being used for patients with progression on the third generation EGFR TKI osimertinib. Actually, the distribution of osimertinib resistance mechanisms, as known to date, largely comes from ctDNA based datasets, because biopsy based analyses are scarce. Due to impaired sensitivity of ctDNA based analyses when compared to tissue based analysis, especially for copy number variations, these reports might be misleading and lead to suboptimal treatment. Early reports of tumor samples obtained after progression on first / second generation EGFR TKI's have shown that ctDNA and tumor based drug resistance analyses can be concordant or disconcordant and that the tests should be regarded as complimentary \\[Oxnard et al\\].\n\nSensitivity and specificity of ctDNA and biopsy based drug resistance analysis after osimertinib treatment and how these tests behave within individual patients are unknown.\n\nThorough and complete osimertinib resistance analysis enables optimal treatment decision making and might identify new targets for molecular treatment, thereby potentially improving patient outcome.",

    "brief_summary": "Breast cancer is an optimal \"model disease\" for studying personalized medicine. Breast cancer was the first malignancy for which a predictive factor forecasting response to therapy was identified nearly 50 years ago; the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER). Furthermore, breast cancer is by far the malignancy in which prognostic and predictive factors have been most extensively studied. Primary medical treatment (pre-surgical medical therapy) offers a unique setting to explore predictive factors due to the fact that primary breast cancers are easily accessible to repeated tissue sampling and evaluation of therapy response both clinically and radiologically. For many years, the investigators have studied predictive factors in primary medical treatment of breast cancer. In the present project, the investigators will implement a new trial concept where the current knowledge from previous trials with respect to predictive markers (hormone receptors, HER2; TP53, CHEK2 and RB1), will be combined with massive parallel sequencing (MPS). Thereby, the investigators aim to design the \"next-generation\" primary medical treatment where 1) therapy regimens are individualized based on a limited number of known predictive factors and, 2) MPS is used to explore additional predictive factors and their co-regulators in order to fully identify the mechanisms of drug sensitivity / resistance across individual tumours and pave the way for further personalized breast cancer therapy in the future. As for the new era of \"genomic medicine\", the current trial concept will allow individual tumours to be characterized by their unique gene mutation / epigenetic modification profile upfront, to allocate patients to their optimal personalized medicine as compared to \"classical\" drug testing through phase II/III trials.",

    "detailed_description": "CFI-400945 is a new type of drug for breast cancer. Laboratory tests show that it works by blocking a specific protein called Polo-like Kinase 4 (PLK4) that is involved in cancer cell growth. CFI-400945 may slow down the growth of cancer cells or may cause cancer cells to die. This drug has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in more than 60 patients. It appears to be well tolerated with few side effects. CFI-400945 seems promising but it is not clear if it can offer better results than standard therapy.\n\nDurvalumab is a new type of drug for many types of cancer. Durvalumab is an immunotherapy drug and not a chemotherapy drug. Laboratory tests show that it works by allowing the immune system (PD-1 and PD-L1 interaction) to detect your cancer and reactivating the immune response. This may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer cells to die. Durvalumab has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in more than 6000 people. In laboratory studies, when used together with CFI-400945, results seem promising but it is not clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment alone. This is the first time that the combination of CFI-400945 and durvalumab has been tested in patients.",

These results may support labelling statements with regard to posology and food.",
    "detailed_description": "Selumetinib is approved by the FDA for the treatment of paediatric patients 2 years of age and older with NF1 who have symptomatic, inoperable PN.\n\nThe efficacy of selumetinib in the treatment of NF1 related inoperable PN in paediatric participants was demonstrated in the SPRINT study in which selumetinib was taken at 25 mg/m2 bid under fasted conditions (fast for 2 hours before each dose and 1 hour after each dose). Safety data from this study showed that selumetinib has a generally predictable and manageable safety profile in this population. Gastrointestinal AEs were commonly reported but were predominantly mild/moderate in severity, predictable, and generally did not affect the ability of participants to remain on treatment. However, GI AEs in this paediatric study were reported at a higher frequency than that reported in an analysis of selumetinib in adult oncology participants. Dosing in a fed state is known to reduce GI tolerability for some oncology drugs; such a dosing regimen has an added benefit of improving compliance and adherence to dosing posology.\n\nFood-effect studies conducted in healthy participants (Study D1532C00069) and adult participants with cancer (Study D1532C00020) show that consumption of a high fat meal reduces absorption of selumetinib: in healthy participants Cmax was reduced by 50% and AUC by 16%; and in participants with cancer Cmax was reduced by 62% and AUC by 19%. A further study in adult healthy participants (D1532C00089) found that a low fat, low calorie meal reduces the rate of absorption (Cmax reduced by 65% and tmax delayed by 2.5 hours) and the extent of absorption (AUC reduced by 38%) after a single dose of selumetinib. The finding that a low fat meal had a greater impact on exposure than a high fat meal is unusual and without a clear explanation although in vitro dissolution data suggest that the capsule shell disintegration may be impacted by food.\n\nThe study is designed to evaluate the steady state systemic exposure and safety (especially GI tolerability) of selumetinib 25 mg/m2 bid given with a low fat meal versus the same dose given in a fasted state. A third treatment period (T3) will be initiated if there is a significant reduction in exposure (AUC0-12, SS between T2 vs T1) when selumetinib is given with a low fat meal compared with a fasted state; T3 will evaluate the PK and safety of an adjusted dose of selumetinib when given with a low fat meal. The recommendation as to whether to initiate T3, and the dose to be used in T3, will be made by a DRC. This recommendation will be reviewed with FDA before dosing in T3 is initiated.\n\nApproximately 20 participants will be enrolled to achieve 16 evaluable participants completing T2. An evaluable participant is defined as having received study treatment and provided the last required PK sample in T2.\n\nA Data Review Committee(DRC) will review the PK and safety data from T1 and T2 and determine whether T3 is required. If T3 is required the DRC will select the dose to be used. The recommendation will be reviewed with FDA before dosing in T3 is initiated.",

    "detailed_description": "The evaluation of CCCA in the HR+/HER2- invasive lobular breast cancer patient population allows assessment of treatment efficacy with an achievable sample size of HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients within an acceptable and scientifically meaningful duration of recruitment. CCCA can be assessed immediately after last patients end of treatment. Central blinded pathological assessment of CCCA is planned in this study as a standardized preparation of the sampled tissue by the central pathologist. This pathologist is blinded regarding the study therapy administered, i. e. with or without capivasertib.\n\nThe addition of capivasertib to fulvestrant in many clinical trials correlates with an improvement in PFS compared to fulvestrant alone in patients with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. This effect was observed regardless of a PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation. None of the ongoing studies investigate the effects of the combined treatment in invasive lobular breast cancer. Given that these tumors are less likely to respond to chemotherapy, identification of patients that can be spared from chemotherapy is desirable. On the other hand, it is important to identify patients with invasive lobular breast cancer not responding to neoadjuvant ET who might be at increased risk for recurrence, who would therefore potentially benefit from further adjuvant therapies including chemotherapy.\n\nGiven the high rates of PI3K pathway alterations in such tumors, it is expected that the CCCA rate could be increased by adding capivasertib to fulvestrant. GBG expect that the potential benefit of improved CCCA rate with a combination treatment compared to fulvestrant monotherapy would outweigh the potential risks due to added toxicity, which has already been shown in clinical trials to be well tolerated by patients.",

Patients are treated with Durvalumab (arm A) or Durvalumab + Tremelimumab (arm B) after biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced resectable SCCHN of the oral cavity. After surgery, the standard of care treatment is radiotherapy, and, depending on risk assessment concurrent cisplatin. Patients will be treated with Durvalumab (arm A) or Durvalumab and Tremelimumab (arm B) during six additional cycles, starting from day one of the postoperative radiotherapy.",
    "detailed_description": "Durvalumab has shown activity in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Locally advanced resectable cancers of this type represent a challenge, as the majority of these patients still die from this disease in spite of surgery, radio- and chemotherapy.\n\nCheckpoint inhibitors have recently proven to prolong life in recurrent/metastatic SCCHN, and several new molecules are currently tested in clinical trials in this indication, including PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 antibodies, either as single agent or in combination. These compounds might represent a valuable treatment for SCCHN patients in the adjuvant setting, given the favorable toxicity profile. Combination of Durvalumab (PD-L1 inhibition) and Tremelimumab (CTLA-4 inhibition) is currently tested in recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer, and compared to Durvalumab as single agent, and to standard of care chemotherapy.\n\nIn this study both options, i.e. durvalumab as a single agent or Durvalumab in combination with Tremelimumab, will be tested in a randomized fashion. Randomization would be used to reduce selection bias, in a non-comparative study. Newly diagnosed patients with SCCHN of the oral cavity, will be treated with a single dose of Durvalumab with or without Tremelimumab two weeks before scheduled surgery.\n\nWhen patients are first diagnosed with a resectable oral SCC, a biopsy is taken to confirm the diagnosis, and surgery is planned. This standard practice thus involves sequential tissue harvesting, both at the time of biopsy as well as the final resection specimen, making it possible to observe hallmarks of immune response when patients are treated once with Durvalumab with or without Tremelimumab after confirmation of the diagnosis on biopsy, but before surgery.",

The Investigators will enroll up to 105 subjects into the study. After an initial safety sample of 15 individuals receiving durvalumab (MEDI 4736) and Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR), if it is shown to be safe to administer this combination of therapies, the next enrolled subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion (each subject with a \"50-50 chance\" like the flip of a coin) to receive either SABR and durvalumab (MEDI 4736), or SABR alone.\n\nOnce treatment is completed, all subjects will return to the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) for regular follow-up visits to check on their health and outcomes. At visits both prior to and after treatment special blood samples will be drawn to be studied by UCLA scientists to look into the basic science aspects of how durvalumab (MEDI 4736) and radiation work in the body. It is hoped that we will learn more about the basic safety and science of durvalumab (MEDI 4736) combined with Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) vs. SABR alone, while extending the life and quality of life of these subjects.",

This study will assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of durvalumab plus tremelimumab with or without weekly paclitaxel in patients with advanced BTC after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy.\n\nOn the 25th June 2019, the maximum DLT event number was reached (6/10) in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab combination with paclitaxel Arm (Arm B). According to the Pocock boundary described in the protocol, GERCOR has updated the study to discontinue enrollment in Arm B (durvalumab plus tremelimumab with paclitaxel) . No safety concerns were raised by the IDMC in Arm A. Consequently, the study will resume with Arm A (durvalumab plus tremelimumab) only, without randomization.\n\nDiscontinuation of ARM B(June 2019): Durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus paclitaxel\n\nOne cycle equals 4 weeks (D1=D28); Durvalumab: 1,500 mg by IV infusion on D1, until progression or unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.\n\nTremelimumab: 75 mg by IV infusion on D1 for the first 4 cycles.

ASCO20 Virtual Scientific Program 2020) showing increased efficacy (response rate and progression-free survival) without safety concerns with one dose of tremelimumab 300 mg (cycle 1) instead of four doses of 75 mg (cycle 1 to cycle 4) in combination with durvalumab 1,500 mg Q4W in hepatocellular carcinoma. Following these results, we have changed the tremelimumab 75 mg x 4 schedule for the 300 mg x 1 schedule.

    "detailed_description": "Biliary tract carcinoma (BTC, adenocarcinoma in more than 90% of cases) is the second primary liver tumor in incidence after hepatocellular carcinoma (2,000 new cases/year in France).\n\nThe prognosis of biliary malignancies is poor, with a 5-year overall survival rate (OS) of about 10-15%, most often due to late diagnosis, at an advanced stage.\n\nIn advanced BTC, the gemcitabine plus platinum (cisplatin \\[GEMCIS\\] or oxaliplatin \\[GEMOX\\]) doublet of chemotherapy is the standard first-line treatment and no targeted therapy has been validated in this indication to date. There is no second-line therapeutic standard; chemotherapy (mainly, 5-FU-based combination) yields limited median progression-free survival (PFS) and OS of abouty 2-3 months and 6-7 months respectively, justifying the exploration of new therapeutic options.\n\nImmune therapies (mainly, immune checkpoint inhibitors \\[ICI\\]) have opened new opportunities in cancer therapy. Hence, anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have demonstrated robust clinical activity and obtained FDA approval in several cancers. Recent data showed encouraging results with anti-PD-1 mAb as a monotherapy in PD-L1-positive pre-treated advanced BTC. The effects of ICI in combination with second-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced BTC have not been explored to date.\n\nPlatinum salts can induce \"immunogenic cell death\". Therefore, previous treatment with platinum may increase tumor immunogenicity and sensitivity to immune therapy, particularly, ICI. The second-line setting after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy may then be an optimal biological context for testing immune therapy in advanced BTC.\n\nDurvalumab is a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 kappa (IgG1\u03ba) anti-PD-L1 mAb. Tremelimumab is a human IgG2 anti-CTLA-4 mAb. Paclitaxel is a chemotherapy belonging to the taxane family. Taxanes may enhance the effect of immunotherapy by increasing the sensitivity of the tumor and activating the immune system. Taxanes are used in some patients with advanced biliary cancer.\n\nThese data suggest that BTC may be a good candidate for immune therapy. The combination of anti-CTL4 and anti-PD1/PD-L1 mAb is expected to be active in both immune-inflamed and non-inflamed BTC, and in PD-L1 high and low tumors.",

Globally, breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and the second most common cancer overall. The term TNBC is used to define tumours that do not express oestrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and HER2 receptors. TNBC comprises 10 -15% of all breast cancers. It remains the subtype with poorest outcome and there is a significant need to develop new therapies for this group of patients especially. Moreover, the PDL1-negative tumour has demonstrated no benefit from standard 1st line treatment of chemotherapy plus immune checkpoint inhibitors.",
    "detailed_description": "The aim of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) plus Durvalumab (Durvalumab) relative to Dato-DXd alone in patients with PDL1-negative advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). This is also the primary endpoint of this study and effectivenss measured by progression-free survival. Dato-DXd is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) that targets tumour-associated calcium signal transducer 2, TROP2, a transmembrane protein that is highly expressed in various epithelial tumors including breast cancer. Durvalumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor and is expected to stimulate the patient's anti-tumour immune response by binding to PD-L1 and shifting the balance toward an anti-tumour response. The preclinical and clinical evidence have suggested synergistic activity between antibody drug conjugate and immune checkpoint inhibitor. This study will recruit 140 patients, aged 18 and over and consenting patients will be randomly placed into one of two treatment groups. One group will receive Datopotamab deruxtecan in combination with Durvalumab and the other groups will receive Datopotamab deruxtecan alone. Treatment will continue unless there is evidence of unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or if the patient requests to stop the treatment or death. Safety and tolerability as well as progression free survival, overall survival, clinical benefit rate, duration of response and duration of clinical benefit and quality of life will be assessed.\n\nPD-L1 is part of a complex system of receptors and ligands that are involved in controlling T-cell activation. The PD-1 receptor (cluster of differentiation \\[CD\\]279) is expressed on the surface of activated T cells. It has 2 known ligands: programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1; B7-H1; CD274) and programmed cell death ligand-2 (PD-L2; B7-DC; CD273). PD-L1/PD-L2 belong to a family of immune checkpoint proteins that act as coinhibitory factors, which can halt or limit the development of T cell response. When PD-L1 binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signal is transmitted into the T cell, which reduces cytokine production and suppresses T cell proliferation. Tumour cells exploit this immune checkpoint pathway as a mechanism to evade detection and inhibit immune response.\n\nSites will perform local PD-L1 testing to confirm the PD-L1 status of potentially eligible patients. PD-L1 negativity in this trial will be defined as 22C3 Combined Positive Score (CPS) of less than 10.\n\nDurvalumab is a human mAb of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 kappa subclass that blocks the interaction of PD-L1 (but not PD-L2) with PD-1 on T cells and CD80 (B7.1) on immune cells. The proposed mechanism of action for durvalumab is interference in the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). The blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/CD80 interactions releases the inhibition of immune responses, including those that may result in tumor elimination. In vitro studies demonstrate that durvalumab antagonizes the inhibitory effect of PD-L1 on primary human T cells, resulting in restored interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3)-induced proliferation. In vivo studies have shown that durvalumab inhibits tumor growth in xenograft models via a T cell-dependent mechanism. Based on these data, durvalumab is expected to stimulate the patient's antitumor immune response by binding to PD-L1 and shifting the balance toward an antitumor response. Durvalumab has been engineered to reduce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity.\n\nDato-DXd is an antibody drug conjugate that targets tumour-associated calcium signal transducer 2, TROP2, a transmembrane protein that is highly expressed in various epithelial tumours including breast cancer. TROP2 has several binding partners, including claudin 1, claudin 7, cyclin D1, protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and insulin-like growth factor 1. By binding to these targets, TROP2 affects tight junctions at the epithelial barrier and increases tumour proliferation, podosome formation, and Raf and NF-kappa activation and suppresses IGF-1R signaling \\[21,22\\]. Its expression correlates with aggressive tumour behaviour and has been used as a prognostic marker in several types of cancer.\n\nDNA topoisomerase I is an enzyme that acts by causing a transient break in 1 strand of DNA. This enables the unwinding of positive or negative supercoiled DNA through a hindered rotary system, thus allowing the separation of the double-helix strands. This activity is prominent during cell replication. Inhibition of DNA topoisomerase I can lead to cell apoptosis following multiple breaks in the cell DNA. DNA topoisomerase I has therefore been identified as a potential target for cancer treatment.\n\nIn order to overcome the challenges of delivering cytostatics specifically into cancer cells, ADCs have been developed. ADCs are composed of an antibody, a linker, and a cytotoxic agent. ADCs are payload delivery systems that can target cells that express the preferred marker. The ADC specifically binds and is internalized into the target cells, and enzymatic processes release the drug into the cytoplasm.\n\nDato-DXd binds to TROP2, is internalized, and undergoes enzymatic processing. Thereafter the DNA Dato-DXd binds to TROP2, and after further enzymatic processing, the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor DXdis released, inhibits cell replication, and promotes cell apoptosis. The anti-TROP2 component, is a humanized IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody. The released drug is a DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor derivative of exatecan. The monoclonal antibody is covalently conjugated to a drug-linker, which is composed of a cleavable maleimide tetrapeptide linker and the released drug. The tetrapeptide linker is designed to be stable in plasma to reduce systemic exposure to the released drug.\n\nIn vitro studies indicate that Dato-DXd exhibits TROP2 expression-dependent cell growth inhibitory activity, and in vivo studies using a tumor-bearing mouse model indicate that administration of Dato-DXd results in the regression of TROP2-positive tumors. The biodistribution and antitumor activity of the ADC are expected to depend on the expression level of the target antigen in tumor tissue.Dato-DXd has been evaluated in multiple solid tumors ,including NSCLC, and TNBC, HR+/HER2- BC, and urothelial cancer have high expression of TROP2, 1,2 and the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, irinotecan, shows clinical efficacy in these indications 9,10. Dato-DXd has shown preliminary efficacy in the ongoing clinical studies.\n\nThe screening period for the trial is 28 days. Following randomisation, patients must commence on trial treatment within 3 days.\n\nThere are specific protocol mandated pre-randomisation eligibility criteria that needs to be fulfilled, which includes the below:\n\n1. Assessing eligibility thoroughly using the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria and obtaining informed consent.\n2. Conducting local PD-L1 assessment and confirming PD-L1 negativity by 22C3 Combined Positive Score (CPS) of less than 10.\n3.

Moreover, it aims to demonstrate excellent survival in patients treated by T-DXd (with the use of standard chemotherapy at investigator\u00b4s decision restricted only to patients with substantial residual tumour burden after T-DXd-treatment).",
    "detailed_description": "As the ADAPT-trials have clearly shown, pCR after 12 weeks of therapy, independent of the specific de-escalated neoadjuvant regimen and independent of further use of systemic chemotherapy, is an independent predictor of excellent prognosis4,19, also in patients treated by an antibody-drug conjugate alone (T-DM1), or in those receiving pertuzumab+trastuzumab+/-weekly paclitaxel.\n\nIn contrast to the adjuvant setting, none of the neoadjuvant trials so far has focused on HER2+ patients with a low-intermediate risk profile (e.g., node-negative patients with cT1-2 tumours). The ADAPT-HER2-IV trial aims to close this evidence gap.\n\nSince there is some uncertainty about the optimal treatment duration in intermediate- to high-risk HER2+ EBC (e.g., tumour size \\>3 cm), we recommend using a longer 18-week taxane-based treatment (+/- carboplatin, at investigator\u00b4s decision) due to a large body of evidence for taxane + carboplatin combinations in patients in locally advanced stages.\n\nAntibody-drug conjugates appear to be ideal candidate drugs for a \"de-escalated\" treatment due to their favourable safety (reduced alopecia, polyneuropathy rates, etc.) and a high efficacy profile (e.g., comparable pCR rates after 18 weeks of T-DM1 and taxane+pertuzumab+trastuzumab in the PREDIX HER2 trial20). Similarly to the classical chemotherapy landscape, optimal duration of antibody-drug conjugate-based neoadjuvant therapy remains unclear. pCR rates of around 40% to 60% were observed after 12 and 18 weeks of T-DM1 treatment (+/-pertuzumab) in the ADAPT TP, KRISTINE and PREDIX HER2 trials in HR+/HER2+ disease21,22. Moreover, long-term survival seem to be comparable between T-DM1+pertuzumab and older chemotherapy-containing regimens (docetaxel+carboplatin+trastuzumab+pertuzumab) despite of higher local progression rates and lower pCR in one study22.\n\nTrastuzumab-deruxtecan (T-DXd) has shown promising activity in a small cohort of metastatic patients, including both HER2+ and HER2-low BC, pre-treated with several lines of therapy. Doi et al. reported overall response rates (ORR) of 58% and a disease control rate of 100% with overall survival at 12 months at in HER2+ disease pre-treated by T-DM1+/-pertuzumab in a late line setting23. T-DXd-therapy was associated with a manageable safety profile. Recently, clearly higher efficacy of T-DXd vs. T-DM1 was shown in second line metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in the DESTINY-03 trial24. Median progression free survival was not reached in T-DM1-arm vs. 6.8 months in the T-DXd-arm. This effect was independent of hormone receptor status, prior pertuzumab treatment, visceral metastases, number of prior therapy lines and presence of brain metastases. ORR was doubled (34.2 vs. 79.7%), favouring the T-DXd arm.",

    "brief_summary": "A multicentre single arm phase II trial assessing the efficacy of immunotherapy, chemotherapy plus stereotactic radiotherapy to metastases followed by definitive surgery or radiotherapy to the locoregional primary tumour, in patients with histologically-confirmed synchronous oligo-metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).",
    "detailed_description": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Even with adjustment for age NSCLC is responsible for almost 20% of cancer-related deaths. Recent years have brought tremendous progress in the understanding of the disease, its underlying biology and the development of effective therapies. Traditionally, NSCLC has been treated with surgery, platinum-based chemotherapy or radiotherapy alone or in combination, depending on tumour stage, tolerability of expected side effects and prognosis. Various strategies are currently being pursued in order to increase the patient population that may benefit from immunotherapy and to further improve the outcome of patients with NSCLC.\n\nThe CHESS clinical trial is for patients with NSCLC that has progressed to a small number of other parts of the body (oligo-metastatic) and has not been previously treated, or after surgical resection of a single metastasis (central nervous system or adrenal). The trial aims to reduce the risk of systemic progression and thereby improve progression free survival. Participants will receive induction treatment consisting of immunotherapy combined with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) that will be given to all oligo-metastatic locations. SBRT started early and concurrently with immunotherapy aims at enhancing a postulated immune effect and simultaneously effectively control the macro-metastases.\n\nPreclinical data have shown a strong immune-enhancing effect of radiotherapy, especially when delivered to small volumes, in high-single fraction doses and over a short period of time. Consequently, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is currently being intensively investigated as a partner for systemic immunotherapy. Earlier clinical studies generated proof-of-principle data for the synergistic effects of combined radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Chemotherapy and high-dose radiotherapy are well known triggers of immunogenic cell death and are therefore highly promising partners for combination with immunotherapy.\n\nThe sub-group of patients with \"oligometastatic\" disease was originally described by Hellman and Weichselbaum in 1995. In line with this concept, the current NCCN and ESMO guidelines describe that Stage IV NSCLC patients presenting with solitary metastases can be treated with curative intent using local surgery and/or radiotherapy. Local treatment for oligo-metastatic NSCLC has been adopted rapidly in the oncological community and one reason is the progress made in the fields of surgery and radiotherapy, both becoming less toxic (minimally invasive surgery) and simultaneously less toxic and more effective (precision radiotherapy), respectively. SBRT allows treatment of small peripheral primaries and metastases at virtually all anatomical locations with a favourable therapeutic ratio of local tumour control rates \\>90% and low rates of toxicity. Simultaneously, minimally invasive surgery for early and locally advanced NSCLC today achieves excellent local tumour control with low rates of toxicity.\n\nPatients with a limited number of metastases - oligometastatic disease - are currently treated with combined radical local treatment for all active lesions (locoregional primary and metastases) and their prognosis is better as compared to patients who receive systemic treatment only for widespread metastatic disease. However, the majority of patients still develop systemic disease progression indicating the urgent clinical need for more effective systemic treatment to control subclinical disease.\n\nAll CHESS trial participants will receive induction treatment with the immunotherapy drug durvalumab, standard platinum-chemotherapy and radiation therapy of the lung cancer metastases (SBRT). Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody carefully engineered to attach to immune cells to stimulate their activity against cancer cells. There are now several approved antibodies for the treatment of cancer or other diseases. Standard platinum-chemotherapy includes treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel.\n\nAfter three months of induction treatment the status of the lung cancer will be restaged. If the primary lung cancer is stable or has not increased in size it will be surgically removed if possible or, alternatively, treated with radiation therapy. Treatment with durvalumab will continue until the disease relapses or for a maximum of one year from the start of induction treatment. If the lung cancer has increased in size at the time of the three month restaging all trial treatment will stop and the study doctor will discuss other treatment options that are available.\n\nThe efficacy, safety and tolerability of combining immunotherapy with standard platinum-chemotherapy and SBRT will be evaluated in the CHESS clinical trial.\n\nEncouraged by the positive results of the POSEIDON trial, we amended the CHESS protocol to include a second cohort of additional 47 patients who will receive tremelimumab, in addition to the protocol treatment of the original CHESS protocol (e.g., durvalumab, platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, and SRBT to the oligo-metastatic lesions, followed by definitive local treatment for patients that have not progressed at the time of restaging).\n\nObjectives and endpoints, patient selection and statistical assumption remain the same as for cohort 1 in the original protocol.",

The rationale for this study is that changing external stimuli to encourage adherence to evidence-based LCS guidelines will increase early detection of lung cancer by removing individual and system-level barriers to identifying and prompting patients who are due for care. The central hypothesis is that the combination of patient and clinician strategies will have the greatest effect on increasing adherence because it will target multilevel determinants of lung cancer screening identified in our prior research including limited screening knowledge and suboptimal EHR design.

    "detailed_description": "ORCA-2 is a phase I trial in patients with locally advanced, with or without metastatic nodal disease.\n\nPatients will receive olaparib (a PARP inhibitor) in combination with standard cisplatin-based chemotherapy and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).\n\nOlaparib, cisplatin and radiotherapy will be given in combination every week for a maximum of 7 weeks. Prior to starting combination treatment, olaparib will be started 7 days before the first week of combination treatment. Olaparib will be given twice daily on days 1-3 of each week of treatment (either alone during week 0 or in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy during weeks 1-7). Cisplatin will be started on day 1 of each week, and given once a week during radiotherapy treatment for a total of 7 weeks. Radiotherapy will be delivered on days 1-5 of each week using IMRT, for a total of 7 weeks.\n\nThe phase I trial aims to determine the recommended phase II dose of olaparib (50mg, 100mg, 150mg or 200mg bd) - the dose of olaparib patients receive will depend on the dose under investigation at the time of patient registration.\n\nDose escalation will be guided by the two-dimensional dose escalation design called Product of Independent Beta Probabilities escalation (PIPE). It will recommend the choice of dose/duration combination cohort of olaparib for subsequent patients by estimating the contour that divides dose/duration combination cohorts to be those above the target toxicity rate (equal to 33%) and those below. The recommended phase II cohort(s) are those that have been experimented on during the trial and are also closest to (but not above) the estimated contour calculated using all trial data.",

    "detailed_description": "CLL is the most frequent leukemia in industrialized countries. International guidelines agree on diagnosis and management of this disease. The clinical course of CLL is highly variable and can be predicted by clinical staging (according to Rai and Binet) as well as genetic, serum markers and risk models. This study is designed for a randomized comparison of two different, non-chemotherapeutic and fixed-duration modalities for patients with high risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and addresses a high medical need, since high risk-CLL represents a so far incurable, aggressive cancer. The high risk-group of CLL patients can be identified by molecular characteristics, allowing the inclusion of a clearly described group of patients: 17p-deletion, TP53-mutation and/or complex karyotype.TP53 defects are the strongest prognostic factors for non-response to chemotherapy. Patients harboring TP53 defects should be treated with chemotherapy-free regimens. Complex karyotype (CKT), defined as the presence of three or more chromosomal aberrations in two or more metaphases is associated with a poorer outcome in various hematologic malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In CLL, CKT is one of several well established adverse prognostic factors, comparable to 17p-deletion, TP53-mutation or unmutated IGHV status. Depending on age and prior exposure to chemotherapy, 10-30% of patients with CLL exhibit CKT. A broad body of evidence has suggested a predictive prognostic value of CKT. Despite considerable advances with chemoimmunotherapy in the treatment of frontline as well as relapsed/refractory (r/r) CLL, outcome of patients with CKT remains poor. To date, a randomized comparison to optimize the treatment of patients with high risk disease defined as either the presence of TP53 aberrations or CKT, by novel agents has not been performed. Patients with high risk CLL (TP53-defects and/or CKT) have a poor outcome with chemoimmunotherapy and do not benefit to the same extent from approved regimen such as continuous treatment of ibrutinib or 12 months treatment with obinutuzumab plus venetoclax. Monotherapy with BTK-inhibitor is less effective in those patients as compared with patients without high risk disease. Venetoclax combined with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody obinutuzumab offers a highly effective fixed-duration treatment option with a manageable toxicity profile. The recent results of the CLL14 study define a new standard of a fixed 12-months treatment with obinutuzumab and venetoclax in previously untreated patients yielding a major benefit also for patients with high risk disease as compared to chemoimmunotherapy. However, high risk patients appear to progress earlier than low risk patients and the therapy is not clearly curative so far. Acalabrutinib is a second generation, selective BTK inhibitor which has shown promising overall response rates in patients with relapsed CLL or patients intolerant to ibrutinib. The development of acalabrutinib focussed on minimization of off-target activity. Results of a three-arm study investigating the combination of acalabrutinib plus obinutuzumab versus acalabrutinib alone versus chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab (NCT02475681) showed a substantial improvement of PFS for the combination arm and the monotherapy versus the standard chemoimmunotherapy regimen. The addition of a BTK-inhibitor, such as acalabrutinib to obinutuzumab and venetoclax has the potential to result in a better outcome, because synergistic effects have been reported between BTK inhibitors and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitors or for BCL-2 inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. Synergistic effects, which are expected to reduce early progressions or insufficient responses, are in particular important for this high risk population. The triple combination of acalabrutinib, obinutuzumab (or rituximab) and venetoclax has been investigated in a phase 1 b- study and had a tolerable safety profile with minimal to no drug-drug interactions, results of a phase 2 trial studying the same combination showed that the triple combination was highly active with 78% undetectable MRD levels in the bone marrow . Currently, the GCLLSG conducts phase 2 studies, investigating a triple combination consisting of BTK- and Bcl2-inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies (CLL2GIVe: NCT02758665; CLL2BAAG: NCT03787264) and a large phase 3 trial with one experimental arm with a triple combination (CLL13, NCT02950051) but results are not yet published. Acalabrutinib, venetoclax and obinutuzumab is now being studied in a registrational phase 3 trial CL-311 (NCT03836261) against the current standard of chemoimmunotherapy (fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/rituximab (FCR), bendamustine/rituximab (BR) in patients without 17p-deletion or TP53-mutation. Acalabrutinib is indicated in Germany as monotherapy or in combination with obinutuzumab for the treatment of adult patients with treatment-naive chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).",

PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy sources to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving olaparib and durvalumab together with carboplatin, etoposide, and/or radiation therapy may help treat patients with ES-SCLC.",

To assess the toxicity and feasibility of sequential treatment with olaparib, thoracic radiotherapy (TRT)/durvalumab, and olaparib/durvalumab for consolidation and maintenance therapy in patients status post (s/p) chemoimmunotherapy for ES-SCLC.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the efficacy of sequential treatment with olaparib, TRT/durvalumab, and olaparib/durvalumab for consolidation and maintenance therapy in patients s/p chemoimmunotherapy for ES-SCLC.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Perform a comparative analysis of patient clinical outcome according to tumor biomarkers in circulating tumor cell (CTC), blood samples and tumor tissue, such as SLFN11 expression H- scores and stratifying tumors as SLFN11 positive or negative on the basis of H-score \\>= 1.\n\nII. Perform a comparative analysis of patient clinical outcome according to immune biomarkers in blood and tumor tissue, such as PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) 22C3 pharmDx assay and stratifying tumors as PD-L1 positive or negative on the basis of PD-L1 combined positive score \\>= 1% in patients treated with anti- PD-L1 therapy.\n\nIII.

    "brief_summary": "Diabetes mellitus is among the top 10 causes of death worldwide with an increasing incidence. Patients with diabetes are at risk of developing heart failure which is characterised by significant changes in the heart muscle including scarring and thickening. Contraction of the heart involves movement of calcium across the heart muscle and disruption of this process is an early change seen in heart failure. Recently, a drug therapy (SGLT2 inhibitor therapy) in patients with diabetes was shown to benefit patients with heart failure but the mechanisms of benefit are unknown.\n\nOur hypothesis is that calcium handling is altered in patients with either type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or heart failure and that SGLT2 inhibitors can improve this in heart failure irrespective of the presence of T2DM.\n\nScanning the heart using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables detailed assessment of its structure and function by using a new contrast 'dye' containing manganese that has shown advantages over traditional contrast. We plan to further test this new dye as it has the potential to track and quantify improvements in heart function over time and detect changes in calcium handling in the heart muscle, making it an ideal measure to identify the mechanisms of benefit from SGLT2 inhibitor therapy.\n\nThe study population will comprise patients with heart failure with and without type 2 diabetes, patients with type 2 diabetes without heart failure and healthy volunteers. Baseline comparisons will be made between the four groups before progressing to the randomised controlled trial with heart failure patients only. Patients will have a clinical assessment and blood tests, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and MRI of the heart at each visit.\n\nIf successful, this study will give us significant insights into mechanisms of action of SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure and will enable us to tailor specific treatments in heart failure patients.",
    "detailed_description": "The study is designed to investigate the myocardial calcium handling in patients with heart failure with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus and if Dapagliflozin (study drug) improves the myocardial calcium handling in patients with heart failure and diabetes mellitus.\n\nWe propose to conduct this study in two parts.\n\n1. OBSERVATIONAL CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY\n\n   An observational cross-sectional study will be undertaken to compare myocardial calcium in patients with diabetes mellitus and normal left ventricular ejection fraction (n=20), patients with heart failure in the absence of diabetes mellitus (n=60), and patients with both diabetes mellitus and heart failure (n=60). They will be compared with healthy volunteers (n=20).\n\n   There will be an initial meeting, where informed consent will be documented and a medical assessment including blood tests will be undertaken as well as an echocardiogram will be performed. Healthy volunteers will only undergo Manganese enhanced cardiac MRI scan. The other cohorts will undergo a gadolinium enhanced cardiac MRI scan on their first visit. On a subsequent visit, they will undergo 1 cardiac Manganese enhanced Manganese MRI scan (MEMRI) which lasts 45-60 minutes. Participants will be monitored with blood pressure and ECG monitoring throughout the MEMRI scan. Patients will be offered an anti-sickness medication if required following the MEMRI scan.\n2. RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL\n\nWe will undertake a randomised double-blind placebo controlled trial of patients with heart failure with (n=60) and without (n=60) type 2 diabetes mellitus. These participants would have been recruited as part of the observational study as described above from out-patient clinics at the Edinburgh Heart Centre. If all eligibility criteria are met, patients will be randomised to receive treatment with either Dapagliflozin 10 mg, or matched placebo, once daily for 6 months at a ratio of 1:1. Detailed clinical assessment including history and examination, blood sampling, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and cardiac MRI will be collected at baseline, 1 and 6 months.\n\nThere will also be a 3 month safety visit after randomisation to record any adverse events.",

Monoclonal antibodies directed against CD73 could help to reprogram the tumor microenvironement by decreasing the adenosine mediated immunosuppression, particularly as a synergistic immunotherapeutic combination with immune checkpoint blockade.\n\nThe SYNERGY trial investigates the role of an anti-CD73 (MEDI9447) in a randomized phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combination of chemotherapy (paclitaxel + carboplatin) with immunotherapy (durvalumab \\[anti-PD-L1\\] +/- MEDI9447 \\[anti-CD73\\]) in previously untreated locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC.\n\nA large translational research program is planned including baseline and dynamic biomarkers",
    "detailed_description": "The trial consists of two parts:\n\nPHASE I Part 1 is a phase I trial examining the combination of paclitaxel, carboplatin, durvalumab and oleclumab in order to define the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of oleclumab in this treatment combination.\n\nThe period for DLT evaluation is defined as the time from receiving the first dose of oleclumab until the planned administration of the third dose; this corresponds to 28 days after receiving the first dose of oleclumab in case no treatment interruption occured.\n\nPatients who develop a DLT will stop study treatment permanently.\n\nPHASE II Part 2 is a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial investigating the role of an anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody (oleclumab) in combination with an anti-PD-L1 antibody (durvalumab) plus chemotherapy (paclitaxel + carboplatin) as first-line treatment for locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC.\n\nPatients will be randomized between chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) with immunotherapy including durvalumab with or without oleclumab (1:1 ratio).\n\nPHASE I and PHASE II\n\nPaclitaxel and carboplatin will be given weekly for a total of 12 injections. Immunotherapy (durvalumab with or without oleclumab) will be given as long as the patient benefits. Premature discontinuation of paclitaxel/carboplatin or discontinuation of durvalumab/oleclumab is indicated in case of:\n\n* Progressive disease (PD) using RECIST v1.1 criteria or iRECIST assessed locally\n* Unacceptable toxicity\n* Intercurrent illness that necessitates discontinuation of study treatment\n* Investigator's decision to withdraw the subject\n* Pregnancy\n* Subject noncompliance with the study treatment or procedure requirements\n* Withdrawal of consent to treatment\n* Death\n* Administrative reasons requiring cessation of study treatment.\n\nInitial disease status will be evaluated by imaging studies (contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest, the abdomen and the pelvis or MRI of the chest, the abdomen and the pelvis) during the screening phase. Disease status will be followed by imaging studies at weeks 8 (\u00b1 3 days), 16 (\u00b1 3 days) and 24 (\u00b1 3 days) post start of treatment (allowing efficacy data to be captured as close to 24 weeks post start of study treatment as possible for a more accurate evaluation of DCR). Thereafter imaging will continue every 12 weeks (\u00b1 3 days; contrast-enhanced CT scan or MRI) independent of any treatment delays.\n\nPatients who stopped all study treatments for reasons other than PD will continue post-treatment imaging studies for disease status follow-up as described in the schedule of assessment until verified PD, start of a new anti-cancer treatment, withdrawal of consent to study participation, death, or end of the study whichever comes first.\n\nNote: Pseudo-progression related to immunotherapy: Patients experiencing PD as defined by RECIST v1.1 can continue the study treatment in case of good clinical condition assessed by a stable or even improved ECOG performance status. If the next assessment of tumour burden (8 weeks later) confirms PD (as defined by iRECIST) study treatment must be discontinued. Unconfirmed PD as defined by iRECIST (iUPD) can only be assigned for the first 2 imaging assessments (week 8 and week 16) and several times as long as confirmed progression (iCPD) is not confirmed at the next assessment. If PD is not confirmed, reassessments continue as originally planned.",

    "detailed_description": "Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) is a rare tumor, accounting nowadays for 10-15% of all new lung cancer diagnosis. Approximately one third of patients present with limited disease (LD-SCLC) confined to the chest with a median survival from 18 to 24 months and a 5-year survival rate between 20% and 25%. A platinum-based chemotherapy combined with etoposide and a concurrent thoracic radiotherapy represents the standard of care for LD-SCLC treatment with a median PFS of 12 months. However, sequential radiotherapy may be preferable for patients with poor performance status or having comorbidity predisposing to a worst tolerability. Clinical evidence supports the immunogenicity of SCLC and the involvement of immune activity in SCLC development and prognosis.\n\nSeveral immune checkpoint inhibitors got the approbation in first and further lines for the advanced SCLC in the last decade. The most important results have been achieved in the first-line setting for patients receiving a combination of platinum - etoposide chemotherapy and an anti-PD1/PDL-1 inhibitor compared to chemotherapy alone. However, despite these were the first positive results after a while in this setting, the modest absolute benefit showed (3 months) have to be taking into account. The possibility to enhance the immunotherapy efficacy in SCLC field with the radiotherapy administered as part of the standard treatment for a LD-SCLC seems to be a great opportunity. In the PACIFIC trial, the sequential administration of durvalumab in patients with locally advanced, unresectable, stage III Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) whose disease had not progressed following platinum-based concurrent thoracic CRT showed a dramatic overall survival improvement compared to placebo, with manageable toxicities. The ADRIATIC phase III trial, is currently recruiting LD-SCLC patients not progressing after the concomitant CRT (NCT03703297). Patients are randomized to receive durvalumab, durvalumab plus tremelimumab or placebo as maintenance treatment. In this trial, only ECOG PS 0-1 patients able to receive a concomitant CRT are eligible. However, in our clinical practice, LD-SCLC patients may not respect these criteria due to the aggressiveness of cancer and comorbidities.\n\nThus, DURVALUNG study aims to evaluate the efficacy of durvalumab maintenance treatment in frail LD-SCLC patients who have not progressed following platinum-based concomitant or sequential CRT.",

    "detailed_description": "This is a multi-institutional, open-label, phase 2 trial assessing the efficacy of sequential antibody drug conjugate (ADC) treatment with Dato-DXd or T-DXd in patients with HER2-negative (HER2-low and HER2-0) locally advanced unresectable or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). There are two parts to this study, which has a sequential design. Most participants will enroll in Group 1, which has two different study drugs. A participant will be randomized to receive one of the two study drugs, and if there is progression of disease on the study drug that was originally assigned, a participant will crossover to a different arm in Group 2 and receive the other study drug. Some participants may enroll directly to Group 2 if they already received the first drug. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of sequential ADC therapy by switching the target of the ADC.\n\nRandomization means participants are placed into a treatment arm by chance. Participants will be randomized into one of four treatment arms in Group 1:\n\n* Arm A: Trastuzumab deruxtecan in hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC)\n* Arm B: Trastuzumab deruxtecan in HR-negative MBC\n* Arm C: Datopotamab deruxtecan in HR-positive MBC\n* Arm D: Datopotamab deruxtecan in HR-negative MBC\n\nParticipants may crossover to one of the below treatment arms in Group 2:\n\n* Arm E: Datopotamab deruxtecan in HR-positive MBC\n* Arm F: Datopotamab deruxtecan in HR-negative MBC\n* Arm G: Trastuzumab deruxtecan in HR-positive MBC\n* Arm H: Trastuzumab deruxtecan in HR-negative MBC\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Datopotamab deruxtecan as a treatment for HER2-low metastatic breast cancer.\n\nThe U.S. FDA has approved Trastuzumab deruxtecan for previously treated HER2-low metastatic breast cancer, and for other uses.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment visits, blood tests, tumor biopsies, questionnaires, echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, Computerized Tomography (CT) scans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, and eye exams.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment for as long as there is benefit. After the study treatment ends, participants will be followed approximately every six months thereafter.\n\nIt is expected that about 357 people will take part in this research study.\n\nAstraZeneca is supporting this research study by providing the study drugs and funding.",

Maintenance of Oalaprib can delay the disease progression in patients with BRCA1/2 mutated advanced ovarian cancer after treatment with platinum based chemotherapy. The investigators design a phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance of Olaparib in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The investigators enroll patients with metastatic ER(+)Her2(-) or triple-negative breast cancer. Patients who are chemotherapy-na\u00efve or prior 1-line chemotherapy are eligible for screening. All eligible patients will receive 4 cycles of platinum based chemotherapy. Gene test will be performed on their breast tumor. If patients have mutation of HR genes and at least stable disease after platinum based chemotherapy, they will be randomized to treatment arm (Olaparib maintenance) or control arm (continuation of chemotherapy). The primary end-point is progression-free survival, and the secondary end-point is to assess the response rate, overall survival and quality of life.",

It targets a specific pathway in cells that repairs damage to DNA, specifically by blocking a protein called ATR. ATR notices when there is injury to DNA, which is the blueprint that allows cells to function and replicate, and works to repair that damage. Studies done in a laboratory setting and cell lines suggest that MDS and CMML cells rely specifically on the ATR pathway to fix DNA damage and survive; by inhibiting ATR with AZD6738, MDS or CMML cells appear to selectively accumulate DNA damage and die, but healthy cells appear to be less sensitive to this target. This suggests that inhibiting ATR may be a way to selectively target MDS or CMML cells.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are looking to first investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD6738. The investigators will also evaluate whether AZD6738 has any effect on tumor growth, measure the activity of AZD6738 in the bone marrow, and study how AZD6738 is cleared by the body.",

It will be given concurrently with the first dose of radiation (RT). The starting RT dose level will be given as 6 Gy for 2 fractions (12 Gy total) every other day over approximately one week to sites of gross disease (Table 1) only to minimize exposure to normal tissue. If toxicity develops and surgery is delayed by more than 8 weeks (qualifying as a DLT), the radiation dose will be dropped per protocol for the next set of patients. If this dose is tolerated, the dose will be increased to 6 Gy for 3 fractions (18 Gy total) for the next 3 patients. Patients will proceed to surgical resection approximately 3-6 weeks after radiation as recommended by the ENT surgeon.",

In the rare situation that patients are positive for two or more putative biomarkers relevant across different drugs, treatment will be allocated in accordance with the following strategy:\n\n* All amplifications and rearrangements will be treated with targeted agent appropriate to them irrespective of concomitant mutations. This will yield crucial predictive biomarker information.\n* For concomitant mutations decisions will be made by the Chief Investigator on a case-by-case basis and based on close consideration of pathway preference and likely dominance of one signal pathway over another together with any pre-clinical efficacy studies that address the activity of the drugs in the presence of concomitant mutations.

Additionally, many patients at risk for diabetes develop metabolically driven complications including kidney and heart disease. Novel sub-phenotyping analysis identified clusters of risk for diabetes associated with different complications, mainly affecting the kidneys, opening opportunities to new therapeutic approaches, despite and in addition to lifestyle changes. So far, pharmacological therapy is not indicated for patients with prediabetes. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce progression of diabetic nephropathy and ischemic heart disease in patients with diabetes and high cardiovascular risk, in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and in individuals with advanced CKD. Yet, no prospective data are available in patients with prediabetes and beginning chronic kidney disease, reflected by normal or modestly reduced GFR and increased uACR (\\> 30mg/g, KDIGO G1A2 - G2A2).\n\nSubphenotyping of patients with newly onset diabetes suggests that for some individuals, it would be too late to start interventions against deteriorating renal function at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, individuals at the highest risk to develop T2D and renal failure should receive preventive measures well before the diagnosis of T2D. This study will provide evidence whether such an early intervention contributes to the preservation of renal function in high-risk individuals who already have microalbuminuria. The studied population will comprise individuals who are likely to develop T2D and nephropathy but in clinical practice do not receive medical treatment due to the early stage of the disease. Thereese subjects will receive Dapagliflozin 10 mg or Placebo for two years. The placebo treatment arm reflects current practice. In order guarantee a benefit the patients in the placebo arm will receive a lifestyle intervention.",

However, MRA has been extremely under-used globally. The main reason for this seems to be increased risk of hyperkalemia in individuals on MRA. Theoretically, by limiting the risk of hyperkalemia it could thus be possible to optimize MRA therapy. This is studied in this randomized controlled trial in which it is investigated whethere adding a potassium-binder in combination with MRA treatment prevent hyperkalemia to a greater extent than only using MRA.\n\nThe specific aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate (SZC) in optimizing MRA in symptomatic patients with HFrEF.\n\nA multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study in Sweden (n=110)\n\nThe study consists of 2 phases: 1) open-label run-in within maximum 2 months, where all are treated with SZC to test tolarability, and 2) a 1:1 randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled treatment during 6 months.\n\nThe open-label phase, in turn, consists of three periods: run-in (1 - 2 weeks), correc-tion (maximum 72 hours) and maintenance (4-7 weeks). In addition, post-randomization phase, all patients will be followed by 3 visits (Follow-Up 1, 2 and 3) at 1, 2 and 4 weeks after End of Study (EOS) / End of Treatment (EOT) (which comes first) for further control of kalium and creatinine levels and documentation of current MRA use incl dose.\n\nSodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate (SZC) (Lokelma)\u00ae, 5 g, 10 g, orally, is an approved drug in Sweden. For correction of hyperkalemia, the recommended starting dose is 10 g, three times daily. Once normokalemia has been achieved, the maintenance reg-imen should be started with 5 g once daily. The dose can be titrated up to 10 g once daily or lowered to 5 g once every other day as needed, to maintain a normal level of potassium.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo demonstrate the efficacy of Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate (SZC) on optimiz-ing MRA in HFrEF, SZC vs Placebo.\n\nOutcome measure: Whether a patient maintains MRA either at a dose \u2265 25 mg daily (for those without MRA at base-line) or a dose increase by 25 mg daily (for those with MRA \u2264 25 mg daily at baseline) and K level in the normal range (3.5-5.0 mmol/L) at the end of study, without rescue therapy due to hy-perkalemia at any point during the randomization phase.",

DFS is defined as the time from D1 of treatment to time of disease recurrence or death\n\nSecondary Endpoints\n\n* Grade 3-5 acute toxicity will be evaluated according to guidelines from NCI CTCAE, v5.0 and include toxicity from the first day of treatment with immunotherapy until 30 days after completion of concurrent immunotherapy and radiation. Toxicity will include all toxicity attributed to the total study regimen (inclusive of radiation) not just to durvalumab alone.\n* Grade chronic 3-5 toxicity will be evaluated according to guidelines from NCI CTCAE, v5.0 and include toxicity continuing or occurring 30 days after completion of concurrent immunotherapy and radiation, and will be followed for up to 6 months.\n* OS will be estimated via the Kaplan-Meier method. OS is defined as the time from D1 of treatment to death from any cause.\n* Measure PD-LI expression by immunohistochemistry.

HPV status will be correlated with disease free survival following treatment of adjuvant durvalumab with radiotherapy\n* Measure tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) by flow cytometry at baseline (post-surgical, pre-treatment tissue) and at disease progression (post-treatment tissue). Changes in TIL levels will be compared between these two time points.\n\nTreatment Dosage This Phase II trial will evaluate the combination of durvalumab with radiation therapy as post-operative therapy in intermediate risk patients with HNSCC. All patients will receive durvalumab and radiation therapy during cycles 1-3. Radiation therapy is administered per standard radiation oncology regimens, on a daily basis and/or as scheduled during a Monday-Friday working week. Radiation therapy is given concurrently with durvalumab during Cycles 1-3. Durvalumab treatment (1500 mg Q3W) Cycles 1-3 are 3-weeks long cycles (total of 9 weeks). Radiation therapy will be delivered at a dose of 2 Gy over 30 fractions totalling a final dose of 60 Gy. Radiation treatment will take 6 weeks (Mon-Fri) or 30 days and will occur for 6 of 9 weeks that define Cycles 1-3. However, due to delays or missed appointments, completion of those 30 fractions may take longer than the allotted 6 weeks and this is allowed. Radiation therapy must be scheduled and completed within Cycles 1-3 and should not extend into Cycle 4. Please refer to Section 6.2 for additional details and allowances.\n\nDuring Cycle 4-6, only durvalumab 1500mg Q4W will be given.\n\nDuration of Follow Up All patients will be followed for up to 5 years, or until death, whichever occurs first after removal from study treatment for determination of study endpoints. Patients removed from study treatment for unacceptable adverse event (AE)s will be followed for resolution or stabilization of the adverse event(s). All patients (including those withdrawn for AEs) should be followed after removal from study treatment as stipulated in the protocol.",

Some lung cancers are due to mutations in the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which, if known, can help physicians decide the best treatment for their patients. One type of mutation can occur in the gene that produces a protein on the surface of cells called the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR).\n\nOsimertinib is an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutations. Unfortunately, despite the benefit observed for patients treated with osimertinib, the vast majority of cancers are expected to develop resistance to the drug over time. The exact reasons why resistance develops are not fully understood but based upon clinical research it is hoped that combining osimertinib with another type of anti-cancer therapy known as chemotherapy will delay the onset of resistance and the worsening of a patient's cancer.\n\nIn total the study aims to enroll approximately 586 patients, consisting of approximately 30 patients who will participate in a safety run-in component of the trial, and approximately 556 who will receive osimertinib alone or osimertinib in combination with chemotherapy in the main trial. In the main part of the trial there is a one in two chance of receiving osimertinib alone, and the treatment is decided at random by a computer.\n\nThe study involves a Screening Period, Treatment Period, and Follow up Period. Whilst receiving study medication, it is expected patients will attend, on average, approximately 15 visits over the first 12 months and then approximately 4 visits per year afterwards. Each visit will last about 2 to 6 hours depending on the arrangement of medical assessments by the study centre.",

Olaparib will start one week prior to SRS and continue during and following SRS (1-5 fractions) for up to 28 days total. The number of doses of Olaparib will be dependent on how long it takes a subject to recover from SRS (ideally the subject will be off steroids, if they are required, at the start of Cycle 2, with exceptions outlined later in this section).\n\nOnce the subject has recovered from SRS (based on investigator discretion) that will be considered the DLT period. Cycle 2 will be initiated with physician's choice systemic therapy and durvalumab. Cycle 2+ will equal 21 days. During Cycles 2 and 3, physician's choice systemic monotherapy will be given along with durvalumab per protocol. Each cycle will last 21 days. Imaging to evaluate intracranial and extracranial disease will be performed after Cycle 3, and subjects with response will continue with the systemic therapy and durvalumab until progression (intracranial or extracranial), unacceptable toxicity or death.",

    "detailed_description": "Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women. In people with breast cancer, the body is not able to control the growth of some cells. These extra cells can form tumors in the breast. When tumor cells move to different parts of the body this is called advanced cancer. Researchers are looking for better ways to treat advanced breast cancer.\n\nThis trial will look at six drugs: palbociclib, abemaciclib, ribociclib, letrozole, anastrozole, and AZD9833. AZD9833 is the trial drug, and is the only drug not yet approved for use. Palbociclib, abemaciclib and ribociclib work in the same way and are a type of cancer drug called a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Letrozole and anastrozole work in the same way and are both a type of cancer drug called an aromatase inhibitor (AI). CDK4/6 inhibitors and AIs work together to block the tumor's ability to grow. These drugs have been approved for combined use in people with advanced breast cancer that is HR-positive and HER2-negative. But if people get mutations in the ESR1 gene, it can make the AI and CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment work less well.\n\nThe trial drug, AZD9833, is designed to work with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in the same way that an AI does. Researchers think that AZD9833 might work better with a CDK4/6 inhibitor than an AI does in people who get mutations in their ESR1 gene.\n\nParticipants in this trial will have already been receiving one of the following combinations of a CDK4/6 inhibitor and an AI:\n\n* palbociclib + anastrozole\n* palbociclib + letrozole\n* abemaciclib + anastrozole\n* abemaciclib + letrozole\n* ribociclib + anastrozole\n* ribociclib + letrozole\n\nDuring the trial, participants will remain on the same CDK4/6 inhibitor that they were taking before the trial.\n\nIn this trial, the researchers want to find out how well switching a participant with an ESR1 gene mutation from an AI (letrozole or anastrozole) to AZD9833 works in the treatment of advanced breast cancer that is HR-positive and HER2-negative.\n\nThe researchers will look at which trial treatment helps the participants live longer with the cancer before it gets worse.\n\nThe researchers also want to know more about how safe AZD9833 is.\n\nThe trial participants will be split into 2 groups:\n\n* Participants in Group A will receive AZD9833, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, and a placebo\n* Participants in Group B will receive an AI, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, and a placebo\n\nA placebo looks like a treatment but does not have any medicine in it.\n\nA computer program will be used to randomly choose the treatments each participant gets. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment will be as accurate as possible.\n\nThe participants will take their trial treatments over 28-day cycles, with a placebo and either AZD9833 or an AI taken once daily by mouth for all 28 days. If the participant is taking abemaciclib, they will take it twice daily by mouth for all 28 days. If the participant is taking palbociclib or ribociclib, they will take it once daily by mouth for 21 days and then stop taking it for the final 7 days of the cycle. The participant will then repeat the 28-day cycle receiving the trial treatment in the same way for as long as they are in the trial.\n\nParticipants will visit their trial site regularly throughout the trial. At these visits, the trial doctors will check the health of the participants. They will also take blood samples and do scans of the participants' tumors.\n\nParticipants will take their trial treatment until their cancer gets worse or they decide to leave the trial.\n\n\\*Palbociclib and Abemacliclib cohorts are currently ongoing. Ribociclib cohort will be open pending on availability of the data.",

    "brief_summary": "Rationale: Several studies have shown that higher urinary potassium excretion (as proxy for potassium intake) is associated with better kidney outcomes, lower blood pressure and improved survival. These associations are also observed in patients with (advanced) CKD. However, application in daily practice in patients with CKD, is impaired by the risk of hyperkalemia, due to metabolic acidosis and impaired renal potassium excretion in these patients. As a consequence, patients with CKD are advised to restrict their intake of fruit and vegetables, as these healthy food components are important sources of dietary potassium. This is particularly undesirable for patients with CKD in view of the very high risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nConcomitant use of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) could allow a more liberal intake of fruit and vegetables for patients with CKD, as SZC effectively treats hyperkalemia and counteracts metabolic acidosis \\[1\\]. With this strategy, the beneficial effects of potassium in fruits and vegetables on (vascular) health could also become accessible to patients with CKD.\n\nObjective: To demonstrate that a potassium-rich diet, including the use of SZC as potential rescue treatment (in case of hyperkalemia), does not result in an unacceptable rise in plasma potassium (i.e. max rise of 0.5 mmol/L and no hyperkalemia). Study Design: Investigator initiated, single center, cross-over randomized clinical trial with non-inferiority design (14 weeks, 2 groups: regular diets vs. diet with potassium rich fruits and vegetables with sodium zirconium cyclosilicate if necessary) Study population: Outpatients ( age \u2265 18 years ) with chronic kidney disease stage IIIb/IV and use of inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system (RASi).\n\nIntervention: Addition of fruit- and vegetables that contain 40 mmol of potassium on top of regular diet. Addition of SZC after 1 week in case hyperkaliemia develops (serum potassium \\&gt; 5,5 mmol/L). Weekly measurement of plasma potassium and dose adjustment of SZC if needed",

    "detailed_description": "This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational intervention to use for further studies. \"Investigational\" means that the intervention is being studied. It also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the combination of Olaparib and Sapacitabine as a treatment for any disease.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Olaparib as a treatment for metastatic HER2 negative breast cancer with a BRCA mutation. Olaparib is an inhibitor of PARP (poly \\[adenosine diphosphate-ribose\\] polymerase), which means that it stops PARP from working. PARP is an enzyme (a type of protein) found in the cells of the body. In normal cells when DNA is damaged, PARP helps to repair the damage.\n\nThe FDA has not approved Sapacitabine for use in patients including people with this type of cancer. Sapacitabine and drugs of its class have been shown to have antitumor properties in many types of cancer, e.g., leukemia, lung, breast, ovarian, pancreatic and bladder cancer. Sapacitabine may help to stop the growth of some types of cancers.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are evaluating the safety and effectiveness of Olaparib in combination with Sapacitabine in BRCA mutant breast cancer.",

Olaparib may stop growth of tumor cells by inhibiting some of the enzymes (ADP ribose polymerase \\[PARP\\]) needed for cell growth. Durvalumab, a monoclonal antibody, inhibits the growth and spread of tumors by stimulating the patient's antitumor immune response. Selumetinib, capivasertib, and ceralasertib are inhibitor drugs that may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes (MEK, AKT, ATR) needed for cell growth.

In addition to this, blood samples for haemoglobin, creatinine, HbA1c, cholesterol profile, liver function tests and eGFR will be collected. Quality of life questionnaires (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-12 and EQ-5D) will be completed electronically through CASTOR program in this arm (with the option of paper versions for participants who can not use CASTOR).\n\nAll patients in this arm will also have an ECG and basic body measurements and observations measured. Further venous blood samples will be collected and stored within Glasgow University storage facilities for future measurement of relevant biomarkers and for use in future ethically approved research. Urine samples will also be collected for measurement of urine albumin:creatinine ratio and for future measurement of relevant biomarkers and use in future ethically approved research.\n\nPatients with an elevated Roche NT-proBNP (\u2265125 pg/mL) will undergo a full cart-based transthoracic echocardiogram along with a clinical examination for signs of HF and a HF symptom assessment. A British Society of Echocardiography minimum dataset will be obtained, and report created.\n\nPatients will then also undergo a handheld echocardiogram with a CE-marked handheld point of care (POC) EchoNous Kosmos echocardiogram device. The handheld echocardiogram images will be acquired by a British Society of Echocardiography accredited operator. The US2.ai algorithm (which is also CE marked) will generate an AI-automated echocardiogram report.\n\nPatients who are classified as having heart failure (HFrEF, HFmrEF, or HFpEF) will be managed according to the latest version of European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure. The results of the cart-based echocardiogram will be used during the determination of the presence or absence of HF.",

In particular, atezolizumab selectively targets PD-L1 to prevent interaction with receptors PD-1 and B7-1, thus reversing T-cell suppression. Moreover, atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF and inhibits angiogenesis, is associated with an objective response rate of 27.3% (Cheng et al. 2021; Finn et al. 2020). This tumor response has led to FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and EMA (European Medicines Agency) approvals, in first-line treatment in unresectable HCC.\n\nCombinations studies evaluating anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1/PDL1 antibodies displayed greater benefits (Abou-Alfa et al. 2022). In the Phase 3 HIMALAYA study (NCT03298451) in uHCC, a single priming dose of tremelimumab (anti-CTLA-4) plus durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) in the STRIDE (Single Tremelimumab Regular Interval Durvalumab) regimen significantly improved OS versus sorafenib; durvalumab monotherapy was noninferior to sorafenib for OS.\n\nIn the HIMALAYA study, STRIDE regimen induced long term survival (defined as the absence of progression above 36 months following inclusion) in 103 out of the 393 patients exposed to this strategy (26%).\n\nThe identification of biomarkers allowing the prediction of immunotherapy efficacy in HCC is still an unmet medical need.",

PARP inhibitors can destroy cancer cells that are not good at repairing DNA damage. Olaparib is also approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA) and in other countries for treating women with BRCA-mutated, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer.\n\nDurvalumab is a type of anticancer drug called immunotherapy that targets cancer cells by blocking the signal that prevents the immune system from seeing the cancer cell. Your immune system can then attack and kill the cancer cells. Durvalumab is approved by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer after receiving chemoradiation therapy and extensive-stage small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy.\n\nSome parts of this study are experimental, which means that durvalumab and the combination of olaparib and durvalumab are still in the development stage for the treatment of breast cancer, and they are not approved for treatment of breast cancer, except for use in research studies like this.",
    "detailed_description": "The investigation of olaparib as monotherapy or olaparib in combination with durvalumab in patients with early stage BRCAm, oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative or ER-low, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer who are candidates for neoadjuvant therapy supports the ongoing effort to identify novel agents and new drug combinations that can improve pathological complete response (pCR) rates and event-free survival (EFS). In patients at a lower risk (T1b-c/N0) of disease recurrence and a higher chance for cure, monotherapy olaparib may provide adequate neoadjuvant treatment. In contrast, monotherapy olaparib may be inadequate neoadjuvant treatment for those patients at a higher risk (T2/N0 or T1/N1) of recurrence, and the addition of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) to the neoadjuvant regimen may improve long-term outcomes as was seen in KEYNOTE-522 and GeparNuevo. However, the risk of irreversible immune-mediated adverse events (AEs) of the endocrine system due to ICI use supports the use of ICIs only in the cohort of patients at higher risk for disease recurrence. For both the lower and higher risk groups, the study treatments have the potential for the development of de-escalation strategies in this disease setting where traditional chemotherapy regimens may be avoided altogether.\n\nWhile assessment of the efficacy of the combination of olaparib and durvalumab is ongoing, there are sufficient safety data available to develop a safety and tolerability profile for the combination.",

    "brief_summary": "This study will investigate the use of a new drug targeting the DNA repair pathway AZD6738, an ATR inhibitor). Many tumours have lost important DNA repair functions and rely more heavily on a few remaining repair pathways to survive. Preclinical studies indicate that, in these tumours, preventing the function of the remaining pathways will lead to tumour cell death, while sparing normal cells. This study aims to investigate the safety and tolerability of the new drug in patients with advanced cancer, as well as in combination with palliative radiotherapy, where the drug may increase the effectiveness of radiotherapy by preventing repair of the radiationinduced DNA damage. As the drug has only been given to a small number of patients, the study will focus on safety and finding the correct dose to proceed to further studies, although preliminary signs of drug activity will also be examined.\n\nThe initial part of the study will administer increasing doses of the drug to groups of patients with advanced cancer who have no standard anticancer treatment options available. Testing will establish whether the drug levels in the body and tumour are adequate for the drug to have an effect, and any toxicity will be assessed. After the recommended dose is established, the recommended dose schedule will be stablished by trialing different schedules. Participants will be tested to see if their tumours lack the main DNA repair pathway (those who are predicted to have a better response to this drug). Finally, the drug will be given to patients with advanced cancer who require a course of radiotherapy for symptom control - the drug will be tested at different doses and with different doses of radiotherapy.\n\nSide effects will be monitored and tests will establish whether the drug is enhancing the radiotherapy effect in the tumours or normal tissues.",

    "brief_summary": "There is growing evidence that cancer DNA (called circulating tumour DNA - ctDNA) in the blood is often an early sign that the cancer is likely to return. The aim of this study is to investigate whether treating women who have detectable ctDNA in their blood with a drug called Capivasertib can help control ctDNA levels and prevent developing metastatic or secondary breast cancer.\n\nA recruitment of 20 women with oestrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer (who are already on standard of care hormone therapy who are being treated with curative intent) is aimed for; which means that the disease has not yet spread to distant parts of the body. Each subject will be dosed with 400mg of Capivasertib twice a day for a maximum period of two years.",
    "detailed_description": "Early stage (I-III) ER positive HER2 negative breast cancer is treated with intensive multi-modal treatment which may include chemotherapy, radiotherapy and endocrine therapy given with curative intent. In spite of this, 10-40% of patients will ultimately relapse with incurable metastatic disease which will be terminal and life limiting. There is therefore a need to identify which patients are more at risk of relapse and develop strategies to alter the disease course in these patients.\n\nThere is a now a body of evidence that circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) can be detected in the blood of patients who are going to relapse and that detection of this ctDNA antecedes clinical recurrence by approximately 9 months (Coombes et al, Garcia-Murillas et al).\n\nThis presents an ideal circumstance in which to intervene by considering ctDNA positive patients to have micrometastatic disease/molecular relapse and treating them with agents designed to modify the otherwise predictable outcome of relapse and ultimately death from their disease.\n\nCapivasertib is a potent, selective inhibitor of the kinase activity of the serine/threonine Akt/PKB (protein kinase B) that is being developed as a potential treatment for solid and haematological malignancies. AZD5363 inhibits all three Akt isoforms and therefore has the potential to provide clinical benefit over a range of therapeutic indications.\n\nGiven the recent success of Capivasertib in extending progression free survival in metastatic ER positive breast cancer (FAKTION trial: Jones et al) it is proposed that treating ctDNA positive patients with this drug at this earlier stage may influence ctDNA levels and potentially the outcomes for these patients.\n\nIt is porposed to identify a cohort of ctDNA positive patients and treat them with Capivasertib and monitor their ctDNA levels prospectively over time whilst following the patients for toxicity and clinical outcomes.\n\nGiven that ctDNA positivity in ER positive breast cancer portends relapse whether Capivasertib affects ctDNA levels in patients who have detectable ctDNA will be established. Moreover, there is limited data on how ctDNA levels change over time especially in response to treatments and this study will offer valuable insights into that area which can feed into larger studies in the near future.\n\nIt is proposed to screen a number of patients who have completed standard of care curative intent treatment for their ER positive breast cancer and are established on aromatase inhibitor therapy (\\&amp;gt;6 months) and are planned to have ongoing endocrine therapy for at least another two years. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be screened until 20 ctDNA positive patients have been enrolled. The plan is to take blood at a single time point for each patient and will screen for ctDNA positivity using a personalised ctDNA assay as previously described (Coombes et al, Garcia-Murillas et al). Commercially available Signatera assay will be used to determine ctDNA positivity. Patients who are found to be ctDNA positive will then be started on treatment with Capivasertib and ctDNA levels will be followed over time. If patients are ctDNA negative on their first ctDNA sample they will have an opportunity to be re-tested for ctDNA every 3 months until the end of the screening period (which will end once 20 patients are recruited to start treatment). This is based on data that shows that ctDNA positivity pick-up rate improves with serial testing in patients over time (Coombes et al).\n\nThe hypothesis is that treating these ctDNA positive patients with Capivasertib will have an effect on the dynamics of the ctDNA measurements. Patients will also be followed over time to assess toxicity and acceptability of the drug and to monitor for overt metastatic relapse.\n\nThe outcome measures of the study is:\n\nTo monitor ctDNA dynamics during treatment with Capivasertib\n\n* Percentage of patients with ctDNA clearance compared to baseline\n* Duration of ctDNA clearance\n* Percentage of patients with \\&gt;50% decrease in ctDNA mean variant allele frequency (VAF) compared to baseline",

Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that help fight off infections. Some people with asthma have too many eosinophils in their airways and blood, which can cause airway inflammation. Benralizumab is a new drug that is Health Canada approved and has been shown to rapidly eliminate eosinophils. It has been used in patients with severe asthma to improve lung function and reduce flair-ups, also known as exacerbations. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an imaging tool that can look at the structure of the lungs when a subject inhales a xenon gas mixture. In healthy individuals, the gas fills the lungs evenly, but in individuals with lung disease, some of the areas of the lungs are not filled by the gas and the image looks patchy. These patchy areas are called ventilation defects and they contribute to reduced lung function. The goal of the study is to see if treatment with benralizumab will improve these ventilation defects, overall lung function and blood and sputum eosinophil levels. Subjects will receive treatment with benralizumab a total of 3 times, 4 weeks apart. Before and after treatment, subjects will undergo a series of MRI tests, breathing tests, blood and sputum analysis and a series of questionnaires to evaluate daily quality of life. The hypothesis is that ventilation defects will significantly improve after benralizumab treatment, and that this improvement will be different based on how long the patient has had asthma.",

In addition, PARP enzymes function in roles beyond DNA repair, and specifically for prostate cancer are involved transcriptional regulation of the androgen receptor. PARP inhibition has not been tested in earlier disease states for prostate cancer.",
    "detailed_description": "The proposed study is an open-label single-arm phase II trial.\n\nEligible patients are those with non-metastatic biochemically-recurrent prostate cancer and a PSADT of \u22646 months and a minimum PSA of 1.0.\n\nAfter enrollment, patients will be treated with olaparib at the established dose of 300mg tablets by mouth twice daily. Patients will be followed monthly with clinic visits, safety labs (including CBC w/diff, Comp), PSA, and toxicity assessments. Treatment \\[with a minimum drug exposure of 12 weeks\\] will be continued until PSA doubling from study entry (confirmed with another measurement at least 4 weeks later), development of radiographic metastatic disease, or toxicity requiring drug cessation. CT scans and NM bone scans will be performed every 6 months for patients remaining on olaparib treatment.\n\nThis study will enroll up to 50 subjects. The study design will employ a stepwise adaptive statistical plan, derived in part from Biankin et al, Nature 2015 Oct 15;526(7573):361-70. The design is adapted from a multi-stage design, with interim stopping rules to determine futility or need for enrichment of the study population.\n\nThe study will initiate with a two-stage design in an unselected population. The assumptions for the trial of the unselected population are: null hypothesis of 0.1 PSA response rate and alternative hypothesis of 0.3 for the unselected population. The first stage is 20 subjects. If \u22642 subjects responds in the first stage, then unselected population study is halted for futility and an assessment of DNA mutations present in the initial cohort will be undertaken. If less than 3 subjects with a known/suspected deleterious mutation in the following genes (ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, PPP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, or other DNA repair genes) have been accrued in the first stage, then the trial will proceed with enrichment. If 3 or more subjects with known/suspected deleterious mutation in the genes of interest have been accrued, then the trial will proceed with enrichment, as long as the response rate in that subset of subjects is \u226520%. In the case that 3 or more subjects have been accrued, yet the response rate in that subset is \\<20%, then the trial is halted for futility.\n\nHowever, if \u22653 subjects among the first 20 respond, then additional 10 unselected subjects are accrued. If \u22656 subjects respond out of 30 in the unselected population after the second stage, then the null hypothesis is rejected in the unselected population and broad efficacy will be concluded.\n\nThe trial proceeds to complete accrual of 50 subjects in order to better estimate PSA response rate and strengthen data for correlative studies. If \\<6 respond, then the null hypothesis is not rejected. Again, if less than 3 subjects with a known/suspected deleterious mutation in the following genes (ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, PPP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, or other DNA repair genes) have been accrued in the first and second stage combined, then the trial will proceed with enrichment. If 3 or more subjects with those mutations have been accrued, then enrichment will again proceed as long as the response rate in that subject of subjects is \u226520%.",

Patients in the control arm will receive standard of care following national guidelines and will remain within the control arm throughout the course of the trial. Patients in the experimental arm will be randomised to a treatment class (consisting of one or multiple drugs) based on a biomarker signature. The biomarker signatures are defined as tumour properties or mutations in certain genes/pathways identified in the scientific literature as important in prostate cancer treatment response. The biomarker signatures are identified using a gene panel specifically designed for advanced prostate cancer.\n\nAlterations in the following genes/pathways or combinations thereof constitute the biomarker signatures:\n\n* Androgen receptor\n* DNA-repair deficiency\n* TP53\n* TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion\n* PI3K pathway alterations\n\nPatients in the experimental arm can be randomized to the following treatments classes:\n\nfor mHSPC\n\n* AR signalling inhibitors (Abiraterone acetate, Enzalutamide, Apalutamide)\n* Taxane-based chemotherapy in combination with ARSi (Docetaxel plus Abiraterone acetate, or Darolutamide)\n* PolyADP Ribose Polymerase Inhibitors (Niraparib plus Abiraterone Acetate)\n\nfor mCRPC\n\n* AR signalling inhibitors (Enzalutamide, Abiraterone acetate)\n* Poly ADP Ribose Polymerase Inhibitors (Niraparib plus Abiraterone acetate)\n* Selective AKT Inhibitor (Capivasertib plus Docetaxel)\n\nProBio will use outcome-adaptive randomization, adapting the randomization based on the observed progression free survival (PFS) within biomarker signatures. Treatments will initially be assigned to patients based on the biomarker signatures for which that treatment is most likely to be effective. The trial will be analyzed within a Bayesian framework, which allows for calculations of the probability for each treatment that it is superior to standard of care within a given signature. Each experimental arm will be evaluated for efficacy relative to the control arm with the same biomarker signatures.\n\nParticipants and treating physicians will be blinded to ctDNA profile of each patient. The biomarker signatures will thus not influence treatment choice among controls (reflecting today's standard of care).\n\nFurther, ProBio will use the sequential multiple assignments trial (SMART) concept, where each patient who progresses within the trial will re-enter the trial and be re-assigned to another treatment based on the patient's current ctDNA profile. Patients will be withdrawn after in total maximal three randomized consecutive treatments after inclusion into the study.\n\nThe randomization probabilities within the experimental arm are defined in proportion to the probability that each treatment is superior to standard of care within a given biomarker signature, and therefore change as data accumulates in the trial and knowledge accumulates for what biomarker signatures and specific treatments that are more probable to be effective.\n\nTrial results will be evaluated regularly by an independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB). The DSMB will evaluate treatment-signature combinations with respect to:\n\n* Graduation for superiority: A treatment-biomarker signature combination will be graduated from the trial if it has a Bayesian predictive probability of success in a future confirmatory phase III trial exceeding a pre-specified threshold (85%).\n* Termination for futility: Treatment-biomarker signature combinations will be dropped from the trial for futility when success probabilities drop sufficiently low (less than 10% using a minimum of 20 patients assigned to the specific treatment-biomarker signature combination).\n* Alternatively, if the maximum sample size of 300 and 150 patients (for mHSPC and mCRPC, respectively) assigned to a treatment biomarker signature is reached without graduation for superiority, assignments to that combination will end.\n\nProBio is a platform study. This means that new treatments and biomarker signatures can be added to the experimental arm in the future. This will be done after protocol amendments.",

    "brief_summary": "This is a prospective, non-randomized clinical trial that aims to describe the efficacy and toxicity of commercially available, targeted anticancer drugs\\* prescribed for treatment of patients with advanced cancer with a potentially actionable variant as revealed by a genomic or protein expression test. The study also aims to simplify patient access to approved targeted therapies that are contributed to the program by collaborating pharmaceutical companies and to perform next generation sequencing on tumor biopsies for biomarker analyses. Eligible patients have an advanced solid tumor, multiple myeloma or B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma for which standard treatment options are no longer available and acceptable performance status and organ function. A genomic or protein expression test must have been performed on the tumor and the results must identify at least one potentially actionable molecular variant as defined in the protocol. Results from the molecular profiling test will be used to determine an appropriate drug(s) from among those available in the protocol. The choice of drug will be supported by a list of potential profiles, a molecular tumor board, a knowledge library and by study coordinators for review and approval of the match. The protocol-specified treatment will be administered to the patient once any drug-specific eligibility criteria are confirmed and a fresh pre-treatment biopsy is performed for future genetic studies. All patients who receive treatment with a drug available in the protocol will be followed for standard efficacy outcomes including tumor response, progression-free and overall survival as well as duration of treatment. In addition, treatment related toxicity will be evaluated.",
    "detailed_description": "Problem description: evidence is building that matching targeted agents to tumor characteristics can improve outcomes. Such reports have fueled interest among patients and physicians to use molecular testing for treatment planning when standard treatment options have been exhausted. When oncologists aim to provide such personalized treatment to their patients though, obtaining the drugs can be challenging since off-label prescribing, while legal, is generally not reimbursed by insurance companies. Furthermore, outcomes of off-label treatment in routine clinical practice are not systematically recorded. As a result, the research and clinical communities have limited insight in these outcomes, leading to repetitive use of ineffective treatment for some tumor types, while effective treatment strategies might be missed for others. The latter is especially relevant for 'orphan diseases', that are too rare to conduct formal phase II and III trials. In summary, there is a lack of access to potentially effective therapy on one hand, and a lack of knowledge on broader use of such therapies on the other, altogether leading to sub-optimal use of available resources.\n\nEnvisioned solution and study aim: creation of a drug-access program, in which patients are treated with registered targeted therapy matched to their molecular tumor profile, and in which the outcomes of such therapies are recorded systematically, per tumor profile and tumor type (this is important since it is becoming increasingly clear that the tissue of origin is an important determinant of outcome of genetic abnormalities). We hereby aim to improve and broaden the use of registered targeted therapy, whilst facilitating patient access to such therapy.\n\nPlan of investigation: patients will be treated with approved targeted agents, selected based on results of a molecular profiling test of the patient's tumor. Eligible patients will have exhausted standard treatment options, and their tumor must harbor a potentially actionable molecular variant as defined in the protocol. The study will provide a tumor board to help physicians understand the profiling test results and treatment options, and will enable insights about the utility of this approach. In addition, next generation sequencing will be performed on fresh tumor biopsies for additional biomarker discovery. Patients from the Netherlands and the USA will be included in two similar though independent protocols (DRUP and TAPUR), allowing data-exchange and empowering of both trials.\n\nExpected outcome: early signs of clinical activity of approved drugs outside their label, providing effective personalized treatment options, improved patient outcomes and access to targeted therapy.",

Studies have shown that trastuzumab and pertuzumab treatment can stimulate the body's own immune system to attack cancer cells. Durvalumab is a drug that also activates the immune system. The use of durvalumab together with trastuzumab and pertuzumab treatment may allow the immune system to work harder to kill cancer cells.",

    "detailed_description": "This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of investigational drugs and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drugs to use for further studies. \"Investigational\" means that the drugs are being studied.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved gefitinib and osimertinib as separate treatment options for this disease. The FDA has not approved the combination of these study drugs as a treatment option for this disease.Recently, the FDA approved osimertinib as a first-line treatment for patients that have NSCLC with an EGFR mutation, that have not received prior treatment for their disease.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are evaluating the combination of gefitinib and osimertinib in patients who have just been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer containing a mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene.\n\nNormally, cells in the body divide in an orderly way. However, in cancer cells, this normal process of cell division becomes abnormal and allows the cancer cells to grow in a rapid, unregulated way. In some patients with lung cancer, this abnormal and rapid growth in the cancer cells is drive by a specific change in a gene called the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). This change in the EGFR gene in cancer cells is called a mutation. Patients with lung cancer harboring a mutation in EGFR can be treated with specific drugs called EGFR inhibitors. However, even though these drugs can be very effective, after a period of time, most EGFR tumors will develop resistance to this treatment, most often because of a second mutation in EGFR called T790M.\n\nRight now, patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer with an EGFR mutation would be treated with a single EGFR inhibitor. A drug like gefitinib is a standard first treatment for patients with this kind of lung cancer. Osimertinib is currently approved only to treat patients whose cancers develop resistance to gefitinib (or other similar EGFR inhibitors) because of the T790M mutation.\n\nHowever, ongoing clinical trials have shown that osimertinib is also effective when used as the first treatment in newly diagnosed patients with lung cancer containing an EGFR mutation. In addition, laboratory studies have shown that combining EGFR inhibitors may help prevent the development of drug resistance.\n\nThe goal of this particular study is to evaluate two different methods of combining gefitinib and osimertinib in newly diagnosed patients with EGFR mutations: either with both drugs given together on the same day OR an alternating schedule where participants will alternate taking one drug at a time every 4 weeks.\n\nThis study will help determine the optimal dosing strategy for combining these two drugs in lung cancer patients with EGFR mutations. The study will also follow the clinical response of participants treated with the drug combination to monitor how well and how long this strategy controls the disease.",

Investigators want to test the effects of PDIM on the general EDs in Manitoba. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* What is the magnitude and direction of the effect of implementing PDIM on baseline WPRS of the general EDs, if any?\n* Which implementation strategies effectively support the full incorporation of PDIM to increase the WPRS of general EDs across Manitoba? The participating general EDs will be asked to\n* Gather individuals providing emergency care in their centers for training and education around PDIM.\n* Select a lead person who will act as the general ED Champion.",
    "detailed_description": "Description Investigators defined the inclusion and exclusion criteria using the PICO framework. They will implement a prospective single-blinded RCT involving 17 gEDs. The entire study will be coordinated at the Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba. Investigators will assess for compliance in a scheduled pattern after the education and training sessions using a checklist. They will also sample all the 17 gEDs via RedCap link, post intervention.\n\nPDIM is composed of 3 components. (1) Customized report to the gEDs and discussion with the gEDs on the gaps identified (1.5hrs/session x 2). (2) Pediatric resource toolkits availability via Translating Emergency Knowledge for Kids (TREKK). (3) Ongoing interactions, and intensive training (2.5hrs/session x 1) and education sessions. The gEDs in the control group will receive only the first component of the 3 components of PDIM.\n\nRandomization Investigators have completed the randomization of anonymized 17 of the 28 gEDs. Randomization was performed using an R statistical software program into intervention (n=9) versus control (n=8), in a ratio of 1:1 within pairs. The gEDs were paired using a hierarchical cluster analysis based on the baseline WPRS, ED volume and ED location.\n\nSurvey The validated survey (n/100) will collect information around the six domains of the gEDs post intervention including coordination of patient care, ED staffing and training, quality improvement, patient safety, policies and procedures, and availability of pediatric equipment/supplies.\n\nData management and statistical analysis Phase 1 Frequentist approach - The investigators will perform a meta-analysis to generate a forest plot showing the mean change in WPRS of gEDs with 95% CI. The association between the change in WPRS and types of intervention will be examined in random-effects models.\n\nPhase 2 \\& Phase 3 Frequentist approach - Investigators will perform a descriptive analysis on the baseline characteristics of participating gEDs. The difference in baseline characteristics of the gEDs between intervention and control groups will be assessed using Pearson \u03c72 or Fisher exact test for categorical data and t-test/Mann-Whitney U for continuous variables. The difference between the baseline WPRS and post intervention WPRS of the gEDs will be compared using paired-sample t-tests.\n\nBayesian approach - The intervention effect will be estimated using a vague prior called Cauchy, as will the other parameters in the fully Bayesian model. Investigators will report the posterior probability of a positive finding using a threshold effect size greater than 5, Pr(Effect \\> 0 \\| data), and also with an effect size greater than 7, Pr(Effect \\> 7 \\| data).\n\nSample size estimation - Investigators assumed an optimistic prior for the intervention effect to be a Cauchy distribution centered at 10, representing 80% certainty that the effect size is between 7 and 10.\n\nSignificance of research:\n\nImplementing PDIM will help address the gaps identified in the gEDs in Manitoba. This study has the potential of increasing overall WPRS, which has been shown to have a strong inverse correlation with pediatric mortality. It will improve acute care for children regardless of the location of the gED in Manitoba.",

    "detailed_description": "Every year, approximately 170.000 women are diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and about 80-85% present with a stage II or III tumor making them eligible to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Despite the substantial outcome improvements achieved with neoadjuvant chemotherapy-based strategies, at least 50-60% of patients with TNBC do not achieve pCR and are at higher risk of presenting with early disease recurrences. About 40% of patients with no-pCR experience distant recurrences within 12 months from the end of (neo)adjuvant treatments. Overall, 20-25% of patients with TNBC develop an early recurrence at \u2264 12 months from the end of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. Neither standard chemotherapy options nor approved targeted therapies exist for 35.000-40.000 women/year with TNBC (\u22481200 women/year in France) that progress during (neo)adjuvant treatment or within 1 year from its termination. These patients present a \"hard-to-treat\" disease and a disproportionately high rate of morbidity and mortality. Notwithstanding, they are excluded from most current clinical trials that evaluate the efficacy of innovative strategies, with immunotherapy or targeting therapies in combination with chemotherapy. The treatment algorithm in 1st line is often based on the use of platine-containing regimens that provide very low response rates (less than 15%), no more than 2-3 months of 1st-line PFS and a median OS of about 9 months. Yet, comprehensive genomic analyses performed over the past years on patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy have not introduced concrete findings for guiding drug development in this setting. Comparisons of initial biopsies with post-NACT tumor tissues revealed a wide range of profound tumor changes acquired under the selective pressure of NACT that encompass the development of dominant subclones, tumor immune depletion and stem-cell phenotype enrichment that cannot be addressed with a single treatment strategy. Therefore, it is necessary to explore a broad range of treatment approaches to cover the different patterns involved. The idea is to set a rapidly recruiting phase I-II trials allowing to explore new treatment-strategies in patients with early recurrent and highly refractory TNBC have the potential to fulfil this utmost and urgent medical need.",

    "detailed_description": "Many patients with advanced lung cancer require palliative irradiation of metastases to relieve symptoms and prevent local complications. In addition, guidelines recommend local treatment (including radiation) for oligoprogression during TKI treatment. Clinicians are faced with the decision whether to continue TKI therapy during irradiation, a practice for which there is little data, or to interrupt the oral treatment for the duration of radiation, which may lead to progression of non-irradiated lesions. For erlotinib and gefitinib there is some data indicating that cranial irradiation as well as stereotactic body irradiation may be carried out safely without discontinuing or interrupting the TKI treatment. Although some small case series report on a PFS benefit with irradiation during osimertinib treatment, there is very limited data on the safety of osimertinib during irradiation, and no evidence-based recommendations around stopping osimertinib for irradiation.\n\nThe hypothesis is that osimertinib can be continued without interruption during irradiation of individual tumor lesions in the setting of oligoprogressive NSCLC, or for local symptom control of primary tumor or metastasis.",

This cohort will not be enrolled in the UK.\n* Relapsed/refractory (R/R): participants who have received prior treatment for CLL and who have either relapsed or refractory CLL (approximately 200 participants).\n* Prior ibrutinib therapy cohort: participants who have received prior ibrutinib for CLL and who discontinued the medication for any reason prior to disease progression (up to 40 participants). This cohort will not be enrolled in the US.\n\nOverall response and progression assessments will be conducted by the investigator in accordance with the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) 2018 criteria. Overall response assessments will be based on physical examinations, recording of symptoms, radiologic evaluations, and hematologic evaluations.\n\nTreatment period consists of 48 cycles \\[each cycle is 28 days). Study medication (acalabrutinib 100 mg bid) will be administered until disease progression, toxicity requiring discontinuation, completion of 48 cycles of study medication, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, death, or study termination by the sponsor, whichever comes first.\n\n48 Cycles: From Cycle 1 to Cycle 6, in-clinic visits will occur every cycle and during each visit, in-clinic assessments will be carried out. From Cycle 7 to Cycle 12, in-clinic visits will occur every 3 cycles and during each visit, in-clinic assessments will be carried out. From Cycle 13 to Cycle 48, in-clinic visits will occur every 3 cycles and in-clinic assessments will be carried out every 6 cycles.\n\nSafety follow up visits will occur approximately 30 days from the last dose of study treatment.\n\nIf a participant continues to derive benefit from treatment at the end of 48 cycles prior to the final DCO, they will continue to be provided with study intervention and will be followed in the Disease Follow-up period every 24 weeks (q24w) until study intervention discontinuation due to, for example, disease progression or toxicity, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, death, or study termination by the sponsor, whichever occurs first. Alternatively, at the end of 48 cycles, a participant can decide to switch to commercial off-study acalabrutinib, if available and permitted by local regulations. Post final DCO, 2 options will be considered: participants may be transitioned to another study or may shift to a commercial supply of acalabrutinib/off-study acalabrutinib as permitted by local regulations. Participants who switch to off-study acalabrutinib will be considered as having completed the study and therefore will not have any additional study assessments, including the safety follow-up visit and disease Follow-up period.\n\nThe duration of the study will be approximately 72 months from the first participant enrolled. This duration includes an estimated 24-month recruitment time and an assumed 48 cycles of study intervention (28 days per cycle); additional study time will be accrued during the Follow-up period for those participants remaining on study intervention after completion of 48 cycles prior to the final DCO (the amount of time will vary by participant).",

To determine the objective response rate (ORR) of cediranib (cediranib maleate) plus olaparib in combination in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors of the following tumor types: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the safety and tolerability of oral administration of cediranib in combination with olaparib in patients with select advanced solid tumors.\n\nII. To estimate progression free survival (PFS) in each tumor cohort.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To estimate the prevalence of the mutations of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair genes in tumors using the BROCA panel and to correlate tumor regression with mutations status. (Integrated) II. To evaluate changes in tumor hypoxia on cediranib treatment compared to baseline by \\[F-18\\] fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in patients with NSCLC.\n\nIII. To evaluate levels of angiogenesis/inflammatory markers including VEGF at baseline and on treatment.\n\nIV. To evaluate levels of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) at baseline and on treatment.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive cediranib maleate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on day 1. Patients undergoing FMISO scan also receive olaparib PO twice daily (BID) beginning the day after the second FMISO scan and the rest of the patients receive olaparib PO BID beginning day 4 of cycle 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days (35 days for cycle 1) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks. Patients who discontinue the study treatment for reasons other than disease progression or withdrawal of consent will continue to be followed every 4 weeks until disease progression, start of new therapy, or death, whichever occurs first.",

    "detailed_description": "With the development of cost effective and rapid technology of genome sequencing, precision medicine becomes a new way to think oncology. Current targets involve mainly tyrosine kinase, but DNA repair machinery could also be targetable. Some of DNA repair aberrations have been associated with sensitivity to platinum and poly (adenosine diphosphate \\[ADP\\]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors like Olaparib, suggesting that treatment with a PARP inhibitor may exploit a synthetic lethal interaction when the presence of alteration of the homologous repair pathway was observed. PARP is involved in multiple aspects of DNA repair, and the PARP inhibitor Olaparib has recently been approved for treating ovarian cancers with BRCA1/2 mutations. In addition, it showed that using a high-throughput, next-generation sequencing assay in prostate cancer, detection of genomic alteration in genes involved in homologous repair pathway BRCA2, ATM, BRCA1, PALB2, CHEK2, FANCA, and HDAC2, is associated with response to olaparib. Thus demonstrating the clinical validation of the usage of precision medicine to position PARP inhibitor like olaparib in different cancer types based on molecular analysis.\n\nPreclinical studies showed DNA damage promotes neoantigen expression. It is possible that increased DNA damage by PARPi would yield greater mutational burden and expand neoantigen expression, leading to greater immune recognition of the tumor. PARPi is also associated with immunomodulation. The PARPi talazoparib increases the number of peritoneal CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells and increases production of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 in a BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancer xenograft model. Hence, addition of PARPi to immune checkpoint blockade could complement the clinical benefit of immune checkpoint inhibition.\n\nSuch high level of mutation results in high number of neoantigen and antitumor immune response thus given the rational to use immunotherapy to target such type. A recent paper validate this strategy using the anti PD-1 pembrolizumab Some case reports suggest also that other mutations that induce hypermutated tumor (POLD, POLE, or MYH) could gain benefit from anti PD-1 therapy. Additional DNA repair machinery dysfunction may lead to accumulation of mutations. And such level of mutations could induce better response to immunotherapy. In the lung non-small cell setting high mutation rate were associated with better efficacy of both nivolumab and pembrolizumab.",

    "brief_summary": "PRIME-RT is an open label, multi-centre phase II randomised trial with 1:1 allocation between arm A and arm B. The principal research question is whether the addition of durvalumab to FOLFOX chemotherapy and radiation treatment (either SCRT or LCRT) in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) improves rates of complete response. The working hypothesis is that the use of radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy may prime the tumour immune microenvironment for treatment with immune checkpoint blockade. The main trial will commence after completion of a safety run-in which will enrol at least three patients per arm to test the safety and tolerability of the treatment combinations in each.",
    "detailed_description": "In rectal cancer, strategies to enhance local treatment responses by expanding neoadjuvant regimens are sought to enable organ preservation in more patients. The addition of systemic FOLFOX post long course chemoradiotherapy (LCRT) and post short course radiotherapy (SCRT) has been reported with encouraging results demonstrating higher rates of complete response than with radiotherapy based treatment alone. Immunotherapy using PD-1/ PD-L1 inhibition is recognised to be effective in mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancer (dMMR). Generally, dMMR tumours are characterised by a higher mutational burden, a higher neoantigen load with high density T cell infiltrates and increased expression of PD-1/ PD-L1 in the tumour microenvironment (TME). Mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) colorectal cancer is not thought to be responsive to immunotherapies partly due to the fact they exhibit low levels of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and PD-1/PD-L1 within the TME. Attempts to expand the role of anti-PD-L1 treatment to pMMR CRC is likely to rely on provision of conventional DNA damaging treatments to increase tumour immunogenicity/ T cell infiltration. At baseline few rectal tumours (10-20%) demonstrate moderate-high grade CD3+ responses within the TME, but there is evidence that radiotherapy (e.g. SCRT or LCRT) and systemic chemotherapy (FOLFOX) induce favourable immune responses. In this phase II trial, the investigators plan to evaluate the potential treatment efficacy of anti-PD-L1 systemic anticancer treatment, durvalumab, alongside either SCRT or LCRT with FOLFOX in the gap up to post treatment assessment. This trial will evaluate rates of complete response in each arm as its primary endpoint in addition to safety and toxicity as secondary endpoints. It is a translationally rich trial which involves the collection of biospecimens prior to, during and following treatment in order to understand the molecular and immunological factors underpinning treatment response.\n\nAn initial 6 patient safety run-in (3 patients in each arm) will be performed treating patients with metastatic disease with a locally advanced rectal cancer in situ or patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who will never undergo radical surgery due to patient choice, in order to establish safety and lack of significant local toxicity due to the combination (for example colo-proctitis). Depending on the toxicity observed in the first 3 evaluable patients in each of the arm, an additional 3 patients may be add to that arm for the safety run-in cohort. Following an independent safety review and approval by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), the main trial will commence.\n\nFollowing the safety run-in, 42 patients with non-metastatic, biopsy confirmed rectal adenocarcinoma (cT3b+, N+, EMVI+ based on MRI staging or low rectal tumours requiring abdominoperineal resection) will be recruited to the main trial and randomised to one of two treatment arms. These patients must have adequate physical fitness and no previous pelvic radiotherapy or immunotherapy.\n\nRecruitment to the Safety Run-in period is expected to take 6 months (based on 6 patients in this cohort) with the main trial taking a further 12 months. Recruitment should therefore take place over a total period of 18 months. If the safety run-in requires more than 6 patients, these timelines will be revised. Patients will be followed up for 36 months from date of randomisation.",

    "detailed_description": "Immunotherapy is currently the gold standard for first-line treatment of advanced HCC based of the combination of check-point inhibitors (CPI). The first approved regimen is based on the association of atezolizumab and bevacizumab, an antiangiogenic molecule. More recently, the HIMALAYA trial demonstrated the superiority of durvalumab-tremelimumab over sorafenib, establishing a new first-line option.The combination of Immunotherapy and locoregional treatments in earlier HCC stages may reduce relapse rates. Preliminary data from the IMBRAVE 050 trail reports lower rates of recurrence following HCC percutaneous ablation (PA) or resection associated with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in adjuvant setting.PA procedures and most likely electroporation induce T-cell recruitment that may foster immunomodulation. In particular, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can lead to stimulation of NK cells with a more differentiated and proactivatory phenotypic profile with general increase of functional activities. As compared with RFA, these local changes of IRE induce more robust systemic effects, including both tumorigenic and immunogenic events. Indeed, the preservation of the tumor microvasculature and extracellular matrix within the coagulated zone would favour infiltration by anti tumoral immune cells. These observations are relevant for development of neoadjuvant and adjuvant immunotherapeutic strategies in the setting of HCC treated by percutaneous ablation, and particularly IRE .\n\nNeoadjuvant and adjuvant trials using these new molecules must now be cautiously designed based on the rigorous selection of special populations and therapeutic indications based on the following criteria:\n\n* Exclusion of early forms of HCC with low probability of recurrence for statistical power issues\n* Inclusion of patients with HCC treated in \"curative intent\" by new PA techniques such as electroporation\n* Selective inclusion of patients treated with PA whose immunomodulatory properties are recognized",

    "brief_summary": "A 3-year cluster randomized controlled trial of the impact of a quality improvement and clinical decision support package versus usual care for patients with modifiable high-risk chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with or without a current diagnosis.",
    "detailed_description": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a frequently underdiagnosed major health problem, responsible for over 250 million cases of disease and 3 million deaths (5% of all deaths) worldwide in 2015. Despite resulting in more than $30 billion in direct healthcare costs in the USA, and causing significant morbidity and lost days of work, COPD remains a globally under-recognised condition, with an estimated 60% of cases undetected at any one time, and frequently misdiagnosed in smokers and people with asthma.\n\nEven once diagnosed, about two thirds of patients will have already experienced significant lung function decline or previous serious exacerbations, indicating that opportunities for earlier diagnosis may have been lost. The consequences of this have been summarized persuasively using data from large population-based studies of patients, demonstrating higher future risk of exacerbations, accelerated lung function decline, greater risk of cardiovascular events, higher mortality rates, and larger healthcare costs in late diagnosed patients with a symptomatic history.\n\nSeveral proof of principle studies have demonstrated the feasibility of case finding in primary care, however, in practice it is patchily implemented if at all, with inconsistent evidence demonstrating significant positive impact. This is partially because post-case finding, patient follow-up and management can be poor and significant subgroups of COPD patients with frequent exacerbations or high symptom scores remain undertreated or under-monitored according to quality standards. Such patients represent a high-risk \"phenotype\" in whom risk may be reduced with dedicated measures taken for individualized, targeted management. This may be achieved by analyzing patient electronic medical records (EMR) data as a means to identify patients with modifiable, high-risk COPD in whom there remains options to further optimize their treatment according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) recommendations.\n\nThe CONQUEST intervention (Collaboration on a Quality Improvement Initiative to Achieve Excellence in Standards of COPD Care) will address areas for optimization of the management of patients with modifiable high-risk COPD, or potential COPD, through a targeted Quality Improvement Program (QIP) in primary care practices. The intervention will implement validated algorithms (appropriately adapted for CONQUEST) to identify patients with modifiable high-risk COPD or undiagnosed patients with potential modifiable high-risk COPD, and support their management through a multicomponent package incorporating Clinical Decision Support (CDS).\n\nParallel to this, the pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial - \"PREVAIL\" (PRagmatic EVAluation of a quality Improvement program for people Living with modifiable high-risk COPD) will be conducted evaluating the effectiveness of the CONQUEST intervention compared to usual care. Primary care teams will be the cluster unit of randomization.\n\nBecause of the established relationship between risk of major cardiac events and exacerbations, the effectiveness of the CONQUEST program will be evaluated in terms of COPD exacerbations and cardiovascular or respiratory events. The design of this trial presents a unique opportunity to compare major adverse cardiac or respiratory events (MACRE) outcomes in a naturally-occurring group of patients who are both frequent exacerbators and either treatment-na\u00efve or undertreated at trial baseline, and to measure these outcomes over a period of time comparatively longer than the standard 52 weeks of many clinical trials of COPD medications.",

    "brief_summary": "The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if olaparib, when given after treatment with cabazitaxel, carboplatin, and prednisone, can help to control aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPC). The safety of these drugs will also be studied.\n\nThis is an investigational study. Cabazitaxel and carboplatin are FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of certain types of prostate cancer. Prednisone is FDA-approved and commercially available as a corticosteroid. Olaparib is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of certain types of ovarian cancer. The combination of cabazitaxel and carboplatin followed by olaparib in this study is investigational.\n\nThe study doctor can describe how the study drugs are designed to work.\n\nUp to 96 participants will be enrolled on this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.",
    "detailed_description": "Study Groups:\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in a roll of dice) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. You will have a 2 in 3 chance of being assigned to Group 1 and a 1 in 3 chance of being assigned to Group 2:\n\n* If you are in Group 1, you will receive olaparib.\n* If you are in Group 2, you will not receive olaparib.\n\nAll participants will receive cabazitaxel and carboplatin.\n\nYou and the study staff will know to which group you have been assigned.\n\nStudy Drug Administration:\n\nEach study cycle is 21 days.\n\nYou will receive cabazitaxel by vein over 60 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 1-6. You will then receive carboplatin by vein over 60 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 1-6.\n\nYou will take 1 tablet of prednisone by mouth 2 times each day of Cycles 1-6.\n\nYou will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects (for example, filgrastim) before and/or after each dose of cabazitaxel and continuing through several days. Your doctor will describe these drugs to you in more detail, including how they are given and any side effects you may expect.\n\nIf you are in Group 1, you will take tablets of olaparib 2 times by mouth each day starting on Day 1 of Cycle 7. Swallow the whole tablet or tablets. Do not chew, crush, divide, or dissolve the tablets. If you vomit shortly after taking your olaparib tablet you can retake a new dose as long as you can see that the tablet came out whole. You should take the doses at the same time each day (or within 2 hours of the scheduled times). Do not take the dose if you forget and it is more than 2 hours since your scheduled time. Take olaparib at least 1 hour after and 2 hours before eating.\n\nIf you are in Group 2, you will receive standard of care treatment and follow-up after Cycle 6. The study doctor will tell you more about what this may mean for you.\n\nLength of Treatment:\n\nYou will receive carboplatin and cabazitaxel for up to 6 cycles. If you are in Group 1, you may continue receiving olaparib for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You may no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\nYour participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.\n\nStudy Visits:\n\nOn Day 1 of Cycles 1-6:\n\n* You will have a physical exam.\n* Blood (up to 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, biomarker testing, tumor marker testing, and to measure your PSA level. At some of these visits, this sample will also be used for CTC testing. You must fast for up to 12 hours before the Cycle 4 visit.\n* Urine will be collected for tumor marker testing.\n* At Cycle 4 only, you will have a bone scan and either MRIs or CT scans to check the status of the disease.\n\nAfter Cycle 6, you will have a second tumor biopsy for biomarker testing to compare to the one taken at screening. The type of biopsy you have will depend on where the disease has spread and/or what the doctor thinks is in your best interest. The doctor will discuss with you the type of biopsy you will have.\n\nOn Day 1 of Cycle 7:\n\n* Blood (up to 5 tablespoons) will be drawn to check your testosterone levels, biomarker testing, and for tumor marker testing.\n* You will have an EKG.\n* You will have a bone scan and either MRIs or CT scans.\n\nOn Day 1 of Cycles 8-10:\n\n* You will have a physical exam.\n* Blood (up to 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, tumor marker testing, biomarker testing, and to measure your PSA level. At some of these visits, this sample will also be used for CTC testing.\n* Urine will be collected for tumor marker testing.\n\nAfter Cycle 10, you will only have study visits every 3 cycles. Beginning on Day 1 of Cycle 13, every 3 cycles (Cycles 13, 16, 19, and so on):\n\n* You will have a physical exam.\n* Blood (up to 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, tumor marker testing, biomarker testing, and to measure your PSA level. At some of these visits, this sample will also be used for CTC testing. You must fast for up to 12 hours before the visits at Cycle 10 and every 3 cycles after that.\n* Urine will be collected for tumor marker testing.\n* You will have a bone scan and either MRIs or CT scans to check the status of the disease.\n* You will have an EKG.\n\nIf you have severe side effects, you may return to the clinic more often so the study doctor can check on your health.\n\nEnd of Study Visit:\n\nWhen you leave the study, the following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n* You will have a physical exam.\n* You will have a bone scan and either MRIs or CT scans to check the status of the disease.\n* You will have an EKG.\n* Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, tumor marker testing, and to measure your PSA level. You must fast for up to 12 hours before this visit.\n* Urine will be collected for tumor marker testing.\n\nFollow-Up:\n\nAbout every 6 months after the end-of-study visit, the study staff will check your health. This will be done either by a chart review or a phone call. If you are called, this call will last about 5 minutes. These calls will stop if you withdraw from the study.",

    "detailed_description": "Cancer as a chronic disease: Cancer is now considered a chronic disease and the number of cancer survivors is estimated to be more than 22 million individuals in the United States by 2030.\\[1\\]\n\nCancer and exercise: As opposed to chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and pulmonary disease where exercise has been recommended for decades, exercise recommendations for oncologists has been slow to evolve. However, exercise and rehabilitation interventions are known to benefit cancer survivors. Interestingly, research has been shown that the risk of developing cancer can be reduced by exercising a minimum of 3 - 5 hours per week, reducing the risk of breast cancer by 15 to 20%, decreasing the risk of colorectal cancer by 19-24%, gastric cancer by 19%, kidney cancer by 23%, and esophageal cancer by 21%.\\[2, 3\\] While we know a lot about exercise beneficial effects on the heart and skeletal muscle, studies are emerging on its effects on other organs where cancer cells grow including breast, prostate, colon, pancreas, kidney, liver and lung. Exercise can also play a role in cancer treatment by reducing treatment-related toxic and side effects and enhancing the curative effects of other treatments.\\[2\\] For those undergoing active cancer treatment, exercise has proven benefits. For example, breast cancer subjects treated with aromatase inhibitors develop decreased cognitive ability and lower bone mass.\\[2\\] Exercise is thought to prevent cognitive impairments caused by estrogen deficiency. Similarly, for prostate cancer, physical exercise can improve androgen-deprivation therapy. The most reported issues for cancer survivors are physical problems (muscle mass reduction, pain, and fatigue) and psychosocial problems (depression, cognitive decline, and fear of recurrence) and increased risk of developing secondary comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease.\\[4\\] Physical exercise has been shown to improve fatigue related to cancer treatment, likely by mitigating oxidative stress and reducing hormone stimulation. Additionally, those who exercise post-colon resection have a 50% reduction in disease-free survival when comparing 18 to 27 metabolic equivalent task (MET)-hours per week versus less than three MET-hours per week.\\[5\\] Observational cohort studies show that subjects who have high physical activity after diagnosis have lower risk of disease recurrence and cancer mortality.\\[6\\] Randomized clinical trials have also validated that physical activity interventions both mitigate cancer-impaired quality of life and improve outcomes for cancer survivors. One in ten cancer deaths have been attributed to lack of physical activity.\\[7\\] And, a recent meta-analysis of 38,560 cancer survivors demonstrated a 37% lower relative risk of dying from cancer for the most active compared with the least active subjects (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.54-0.73).\\[8\\] There are a number of clinical trials focused on the impact of physical activity and/or dietary modifications on ovarian cancer (LIVES - The Lifestyle Intervention for Ovarian Cancer Enhanced Survival), colon cancer (CHALLENGE - The Colon Health and Life-Long Exercise Change), prostate cancer (INTERVAL-GAP4 - Intense Exercise for Survival among Men with Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer), and breast cancer (BWEL - The Breast Cancer Weight Loss).\\[12-15\\] A meta-analysis estimated that each 15 metabolic equivalent task-hour per week increase in physical activity after colorectal cancer diagnosis was associated with a 38% lower risk of mortality.\\[9\\]\n\nThe science behind beneficial effect of exercise in cancer subjects: There are multiple mechanisms cited for how exercise produces its beneficial effects, including through hormones, dopamine, transforming growth factor-B1 (TGF-B1), insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), microphthalmia/transcription factor E (MiT/TFE), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and secreted protein and rich in cysteine (SPARC). It has been shown in in-vitro and mice models that exercise inhibits cancer cell proliferation (for moderate- and high-intensity exercise, not low-intensity exercise) and induces apoptosis. One such mechanism involves dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, serum, and cancer tissues. Dopamine binds to the dopamine receptor 2 (D2) upregulating the kinase phosphorylation and TGF-B1 to inhibit cancer cell proliferation.\\[10\\] Another mechanism involves IGFs which regulate mitosis and anti-apoptosis and affect proliferation and differentiation of cancer cells. Studies have shown that postmenopausal women have decreased IGF-1 and IGF-3 after walking training for 6 months, which inhibits IGF's anti-apoptosis effect in breast cancer, for example. Weight loss also reduces levels of IGF-1. Exercise induces skeletal muscle to produce SPARC, which promotes cleavage of caspase-3 and caspace-8, promoting cell apoptosis and inhibiting colon cancer. AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important center of homeostasis and regulator of mTOR kinase activity. In a mouse study involving hepatocarcinoma, exercise reduced the activity of mTOR kinase by stimulating AMPK, thereby reducing cancer cell proliferation. Finally, exercise can regulate cancer metabolism by inhibiting Warburg anaerobic glycolysis and weakening the hypoxia microenvironment of cancer. Lactic acid is the most important metabolite of glycolysis and cancer cells produce lots of lactic acid, creating a low-pH environment. Lactic acid suppresses the immune response, inhibiting T cells. Therefore, by inhibiting anaerobic glycolysis, exercise suppresses lactic acid production, improving the immune response to target cancer cells.\\[11\\] Additionally, exercise stimulates the activity of NK cell function, decreasing inflammation, enhancing antigen presentation, and mitigating the accumulation of aging cells in the elderly.\\[12\\]\n\nGuidelines regarding exercise in cancer subjects and survivors: Both the American Cancer Society (ACS) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) have recommendations for cancer survivors regarding maintaining healthy weight and exercise among cancer survivors. \\[13,14\\].\n\nThe NCCN recommends:\n\n* Be physically active every day - routine activities, recreation, or exercise\n* Avoid being inactive for long periods each day\n* Increase your heart rate each week: moderate-intensity activity for at least 150 to 300 minutes a week or vigorous-intensity activity for 75 minutes a week or a mix of moderate and vigorous-intensity activity\n* Strengthen major muscles with resistance training 2 to 3 times a week\n* Stretch major muscles on at least 2 of the days of high-intensity activity\n* Healthy eating: focus on plant-based diet and limiting animal proteins such as red meat. Limiting processed foods.\n\nThe ACS recommends:\n\n* Getting 150-300 minutes of moderate intensity or 75-150 minutes of vigorous intensity activity each week. Getting to or exceeding the upper limit of 300 minutes is ideal.\n* Limit sedentary behavior such as sitting, lying down, watching TV, and other forms of screen-based entertainment.\n* Healthy eating patterns\n* Foods that are high in nutrients in amounts that help you get to and stay at a healthy body weight\n* A variety of vegetables - dark green, red and orange, fiber-rich legumes and others\n* Fruits, especially whole fruits in a variety of colors\n* Whole grains\n* Limiting red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, highly processed foods and refined grain products.\n\nHowever, no clinical trials were found in our literature search that involve lung cancer subjects. There have been many articles describing the benefits of exercise for lung cancer survivors. Physical fitness, such as cardiorespiratory endurance and muscular strength have been independent predictors of survival.\\[15\\] However, the potential impact of exercise in lung cancer has not been fully explored and there are no guidelines for specific exercise programs. Avancini et al. proposed that a collaboration of exercise specialists is urgently needed to develop tailored programs based on subjects' needs, preferences and physical and psychological status.\n\nIt is becoming generally agreed that exercise improves oncological outcomes in cancer survivors. However, implementing programs for oncology rehabilitation have not been fully delineated. It has been proposed for oncology rehabilitation to piggy-back onto widely available exercise programs, such as cardiac rehabilitation.\\[16\\] It has also been proposed to use LIVESTRONG programs at the YMCA.\\[5\\] In a systematic review of sixteen randomized controlled trials including 2,684 participants, it was shown that the exercise programs that are most effective use technology-supported self-guided interventions.\\[17\\] Additionally, in a meta-analysis of 34 RCTs, exercise effects on quality of life and physical function were significantly improved with supervised rather than unsupervised exercise interventions.\\[18\\] Despite clear benefits, compliance with exercise program amongst cancer survivors has been an obstacle. In a systematic review of breast cancer subjects, only 6 of 17 trials demonstrated that significant intervention effects were maintained.\\[19\\] The study recommended greater transparency in reporting interventions to help maintain exercise programs. It will be important to determine when to start an exercise program, whether at diagnosis, during treatment or sometime after treatment, with the understanding that exercise can be considered another form of treatment and prevention. As the survivorship pool increases, it will be important to educate subjects that exercise is an essential component of treatment and secondary prevention.\n\nPhysical fitness, such as cardiorespiratory endurance and muscular strength have been independent predictors of survival.\\[20\\] However, no clinical trials were found in our literature search that specifically targeted lung cancer subjects on active treatment. As such, the potential impact of exercise in lung cancer subjects has not been fully explored and there are no guidelines for specific exercise programs. Furthermore, optimal timing, assessment for readiness, exercise specifics, and mode of administration of programs for oncology rehabilitation have not been fully delineated.\n\nLung cancer as focus: Subjects with lung cancer have a high symptom burden, due to their underlying disease and comorbidities. Surgical resection (segmentectomy, lobectomy or pneumonectomy), thoracic radiation and systemic cancer treatment can further add to deconditioning and low exercise capacity. It can be theorized that physical and pulmonary rehabilitation can potentially benefit these subjects and improve outcomes. A metanalysis which included 6 clinical trials and 221 participants showed that exercise training may improve or delay the decline in exercise capacity and disease specific global (Health Related Quality of Life) HRQoL for adults with advanced lung cancer.\\[21\\] However, there was no significant effects of exercise training on dyspnea, fatigue, feelings of anxiety and depression, or lung function. As the authors noted, there was significant heterogeneity between the trials, all of which had too small a sample size to derive any definitive conclusions.\n\nSmall randomized controlled studies have shown that pulmonary pre-habilitation and rehabilitation improve post-operative outcomes, post-operative pulmonary function and HRQoL.\\[22\\] Similarly, subjects who are undergoing chemotherapy were shown to benefit from an exercise program.\\[23\\] Despite multiple studies showing benefit, exercise program is not typically included in the treatment plan of lung cancer subjects. This is because this intervention has several challenges. Some of these issues are listed below.\n\n1. Lostistic issues related to creating a multidisciplinary team of physiatrists, pulmonologist, oncologists, and other specialists for every subject\n2. Creating a tailored regimen that is appropriate for each subject\n3. Creating and maintaining enthusiasm amongst to participate in an exercise program\n4. Time constraints of a busy oncology practice\n5. Barriers related to number of visits to outsubject rehab facility, especially for subjects who live far from the rehab center.\n6. Physical and emotional stress resulting from cancer diagnosis and treatment.\n7. Comorbidities\n\nRationale for Northwell Health: Northwell Health is the largest health care system in the region, caring for over 300 lung cancer subjects every year. With a cohesive multidisciplinary team, accrual for this study will not be difficult. The virtual platform and the hands-on support from the PM\\&R and Salaso team will make it easier for subjects to participate regardless of their ability to travel frequently to the cancer center, and level of comfort with virtual platform.\n\nNorthwell is collaborating with Salaso for this project. Salaso is a digital health technology company that has online, mobile and telehealth solutions enabling providers to 'prescribe' evidence-based exercise programs for patients to complete virtually. The ExerciseRx project has two components:\n\n* Platform Feasibility: Evaluating the feasibility of incorporating the Salaso platform into clinician workflow and understanding overall utilization of the platform by subjects (e.g., frequency of use, user satisfaction). Salaso will provide access to their ExerciseRx virtual exercise platform to Northwell providers and subjects and provide the necessary technical support to facilitate training and onboarding to the platform.\n* Clinical Outcomes: In addition to feasibility of the platform the Northwell oncology team seeks to evaluate clinical impact for lung cancer subjects. For example, this will include evaluating pulmonary function and conducting the Six minute walk test (6MWT) and Sit to Stand Test (STS) at baseline and at the 12 month end of the study.\n\n  * The additional clinical components of the study are Investigator Initiated and are funded by Northwell's Cancer Institute.\n\nThe Salaso digital technology is already integrated with Northwell's EMR. Platform satisfaction and FACT-L quality of life questionnaires will be directly administered to subjects via RedCap or on paper.\n\nThe following measures have been taken to protect HIPAA compliance\n\n1. Despite Salaso's integration with Northwell EMR, Salaso will not have access to identifiable subject data. Although data will be collected via the ExerciseRx application, Salaso will only retain de-identified aggregate information and they will share the aggregate information directly with AstraZeneca. Questionnaires will be collected via RedCap. Biostatistician will be able to access RedCap data without PHI for statistical analysis.\n2. Salaso will also passively collect data on the utilization of ExerciseRx, such as time spent in the platform and number of video views, to be shared with Northwell and Astrazeneca quarterly.\n\nDisclosure:\n\nNorthwell Holdings, the investment arm of Northwell Health has invested in Salaso. Salaso's platform is already being used through Northwell's employee benefits portal (myHealthBody) and by the neurology department at Northwell (ExerciseRx). Salaso's platform is currently integrated with Allscripts.\n\nIn addition, AstraZeneca, is funding the use of the Salaso platform with Northwell and lung cancer patients. AstraZeneca funding will be used by Salaso to support the following:\n\n* Development of the evidence-based exercises for the lung cancer patient population\n* Salaso on the ground resource to support the training and onboarding of providers and patients to the Salaso ExerciseRx platform\n* Collecting de-identified data on patient use of the platform, e.g. how many patients downloaded the ExerciseRx app, how often the patients used the app etc. (there will be no sharing of patient identifiable data).\n\nThe following measures are being taken to mitigate any perceived or potential conflict of interest (COI) related to Northwell Holding's investment in Salaso:\n\n1. This study is investigator initiated. None of the investigators have any financial interests in Salaso.\n2. Salaso's exercise program will be provided with no direct cost to subjects or providers.\n3. Disclosure of Northwell's holding in Salaso will be made in the subject consent forms as well as in the final publication of study results.\n4. Updates regarding the study, whether positive of negative will be provided to IRB as per Northwell IRB policies.\n5. All investigators will engage in good clinical practices (GCP) and follow Human Subjects Research Protection guidelines per their Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) training.",

We propose that rintatolimod/durvalumab-combination therapy is feasible and may induce synergistic anti-tumor immune responses in PDAC.\n\nObjective: The primary objective of the safety run-in (phase Ib) is to determine the safety of combination therapy with durvalumab and rintatolimod. The primary objective of the phase II trial is to determine the clinical benefit rate of combination therapy with durvalumab and rintatolimod. The secondary objective is to explore the immunogenic effect and survival rates after combination therapy.\n\nStudy design: Exploratory, open-label, single center, phase I-II study. In phase 1 between 9 and max. 18 patients will be included. In the phase II study between 13 and 25 patients will be included.\n\nStudy population: Adult patients with metastatic PDAC who completed standard of care (chemotherapy FOLFIRINOX) and have radiologically confirmed stable disease according to RECIST version 1.1 criteria.\n\nIntervention: All included patients will receive combination therapy with rintatolimod and durvalumab. Patients will start with rintatolimod 200mg via IV infusion twice per week for a total of 6 weeks (12 doses). Rintatolimod dose will be escalated to 400mg according to a 3+3 DLT design. The first dose of rintatolimod will be administered preferably 4-6 weeks after the last chemotherapy FOLFIRINOX dose. After two doses of rintatolimod, the first dose of durvalumab 1500mg via IV infusion will be introduced in week 2. Patients will continue to receive 1500 mg durvalumab via IV infusion every 4 weeks for up to a maximum of 48 weeks (up to 12 doses/cycles) with the last administration on week 48 or until confirmed disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), unless there is unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion is met.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: The primary objective of the safety run-in (phase Ib) is to determine safety of combination therapy with durvalumab and rintatolimod.\n\nThe primary objective of the phase II trial is to determine the clinical benefit rate of combination therapy with durvalumab and rintatolimod.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Patients will receive 12 doses of rintatolimod via IV infusion and a max. of 12 doses durvalumab via IV infusion. In addition, they will undergo additional blood sampling in order to determine tumor-specific immune and tumor marker responses.\n\nIntravenous administration of medication and blood sampling can cause bruising or slight short-term discomfort. In previously performed trials, monotherapy with rintatolimod and monotherapy with durvalumab proved to be safe showing a low toxicity profile. Therefore we do not expect any major side-effects of this treatment in our patient population.\n\nHowever, combination treatment with rintatolimod and durvalumab has not been investigated yet, and a synergistic effect can induce unwanted side effects. To determine the safety of combination therapy, a limited number of patients will be included in the safety run-in to determine the RP2D. In addition, to explore the local anti-tumor effect of combination therapy, biopsies will be performed before start and after 12 weeks of treatment in a subset of the included patients.",

Treatments repeat every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nFOLLOW-UP PHASE: After cycle 12, patients who are in CR are randomized to either discontinue acalabrutinib or to continue acalabrutinib monotherapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) after cycle 12 continue acalabrutinib monotherapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression after cycle 12 discontinue study treatment. Patients with disease progression at any time prior to the conclusion of cycle 12 may continue study therapy if they are felt to be benefiting by the treating physician, but not past cycle 12.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 12 weeks for 1 year, then every 6 months until disease progression or next anti-lymphoma treatment.",

    "detailed_description": "The past 30 years have witnessed significant increases in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in China. China now is estimated 114 million people with diabetes, T2DM accounts for more than 90% of the overall population with diabetes in China. A large proportion of diabetes is undiagnosed in China: in the 2007-2008 national survey among adult population over 20 years, patient with newly diagnosed diabetes accounted for 60% of total diabetes population. In the Healthy China 2030 Plan, approved by the State Council and the Party's Central Committee, diabetes, along with cancer, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases, are listed as the four major non-communicable diseases (NCDs) for which the goal is to \"control the prevalence and reduce the probability of early death\". Metformin hydrochloride is the primary biguanide medication currently used in China's medical practice. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors used to be considered as second-line treatment after Metformin in patients with T2DM. But according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2023 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, SGLT2 inhibitors are now recommended to be started at the time of diagnosis as the first-line medications, for high-risk individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF) or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Compared with stepwise therapy, early combination therapy may provide earlier and greater reductions in HbA1c and thus achievement of glycemic target. In addition, SGLT2 inhibitors provide cardiorenal protection both in patients with and without T2DM, that goes beyond glycemic control, hence the recommendation by guidelines to implement SGLT2 inhibitors. But early combination therapy is not fully implemented into clinical practice in China. International and CDS guidelines recommends encourage using fixed-dose combination (FDC) to have better adherence, which is associated with lower HbA1c, lower cost and less need for acute care. But in practice, FDC is not popular in China because of many reasons. One of the main arguments is that physicians think FDC lacks flexibility. Compelling evidence has shown that the co-administration of Dapagliflozin and Metformin extended-release (XR) tablets is superior to either of the monotherapy efficacy (Dapagliflozin or Metformin XR). Xigduo XR combines those two anti-hyperglycemic medicinal products with different and complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with T2DM. Bioequivalence was demonstrated between FDC regimen and coadministered Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCl XR tablets. This dosage of Dapagliflozin 10 mg/Metformin hydrochloride XR 1000 mg FDC (Xigduo XR) has no clinical evidence except that bioequivalence study in China, and there are no combination therapy data available either for Chinese people. (Metformin XR usual dose is 1500-2000mg/d). Moreover, there is no head-to-head study comparing Dapa/Met FDC and co-administration therapies to the extra benefits of FDC.",

The goal of the study is to demonstrate superiority of AZD9833 over anastrozole in the context of combination with palbociclib in first line setting.\n\nINFORMATION FOR TRIAL PARTICIPANTS\n\nResearchers are looking for a better way to treat breast cancer.\n\nIn people with cancer, some cells have grown out of control to form tumours.\n\nThe trial drugs palbociclib, camizestrant, and anastrozole are designed to work by blocking the cancer's ability to grow. Camizestrant is also called AZD9833. Palbociclib and anastrozole are already available as treatments for people with certain type of breast cancer.\n\nIn this trial, the researchers want to find out how well taking camizestrant with palbociclib, or anastrozole with palbociclib, works in participants with breast cancer that has ER proteins but does not have overexpression of HER2 protein.\n\nThe researchers will look at which trial treatments help the participants live longer with cancer before it gets worse.\n\nThe trial will split participants into 2 groups:\n\n* Participants in Group 1 will take camizestrant, palbociclib, and a placebo matched with anastrazole.\n* Participants in Group 2 will take anastrozole, palbociclib, , and a placebo matched with camizestrant.\n\nA placebo looks like a treatment but does not have any medicine in it.\n\nA computer program will be used to randomly choose the treatments each participant gets. This helps make sure the groups are chosen fairly. Researchers do this so that comparing the results of each treatment will be as accurate as possible.\n\nThe participants will take their trial treatments in periods called \"cycles\". Each cycle will last 28 days. During each cycle, the participants will take:\n\n* camizestrant or anastrozole once daily by mouth\n* palbociclib once daily by mouth for 21 days. Then, they will not take any palbociclib for 7 days\n\nSome participants will also get either goserelin or leuprorelin once every month. Participants could get goserelin or leuprorelin if:\n\n* They are medically determined yet to reach menopause status\n* They are male\n\nThey will get this treatment as an injection under the skin or into a muscle. Goserelin and leuprorelin work by decreasing the amount of sex hormones made by the body which will lead to reduction of ER production. This can help stop breast cancer from growing.\n\nParticipants will take trial treatment until the cancer gets worse or they leave the trial.\n\nParticipants will visit their trial site several times throughout the trial. At these visits, the trial doctors will check the health of the participants. They will also take blood samples and do scans of the participants' tumors.",

In some patients, cancer cells and immune cells start to express signals that stop the body's immune system from killing the cancer. New drugs being developed, such as durvalumab and tremelimumab, are designed to target and block these signals and may help increase the immune response to prevent or slow down cancer growth. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may help the immune system work even better.

    "brief_summary": "Participants in this study have a type of cancer called squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Their SCCHN has spread around the area where the cancer first started. This is called locally-advanced SCCHN. These participants are eligible for surgery.\n\nPrevious research with a similar therapy regimen resulted in high rates of cancer shrinkage, high rates of avoiding radiation and its side effects, high cure rate and good quality of life. Radiation can be very toxic. The purpose on this study is to try to avoid radiation. If the participants are not on this study they would be receiving radiation as it is standard treatment of their cancer. In the last study with a similar regimen, about a third of cancers had a pathologic complete response with the first part of the study. This means that the chemotherapy had killed the cancer. The investigators are trying to improve the regimen further with a goal of increasing this rate of complete response to the first part of therapy. The investigators also hope that by improving results in the first part, that more people will be cured and that long term quality of life (especially speech and swallowing) will be improved, both compared to standard therapies and to the last study. Doctors do not know how this therapy will effect the participants. There is no guarantee that this study will benefit the participants.\n\nThe prior study used a combination of chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin, paclitaxel and a third targeted anti-cancer drug. In this study the investigators are testing the combination of carboplatin, nano-albumin bound paclitaxel and durvalumab. Nano-albumin bound paclitaxel has been shown to be more active against other types of squamous cancers than regular paclitaxel. It is FDA approved for squamous lung cancer, but experimental for head and neck cancer. Durvalumab is an experimental drug that uses the body's own immune system to fight the cancer. Doctors hope that combining Durvalumab with 2 chemotherapy drugs will be effective in treating SCCHN. Durvalumab on its own has been studied in patients with SCCHN and initial results have shown that some subjects' cancer has responded to it.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to test a combination of chemotherapy to hopefully both increase the number of subjects that respond to therapy while also decreasing the number of side effects that subjects experience.",

Prior to induction, this will be assessed clinically (by imagining and physical exam). Post induction, this will be assessed by surgical pathology report\n* Estimate the overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) associated with 3 part therapy consisting of induction chemotherapy, surgery and risk-adapted use of chemoradiation\n* Characterize the toxicity profile associated with both induction therapy and total 3 part therapy consisting of induction chemotherapy, surgery and risk-adapted use of chemoradiation\n\nTranslational/Exploratory Objectives:\n\n* Correlative studies will evaluate cellular correlates of response and changes in the tumor microenvironment across therapy\n* Explore correlation between measures of clinical response to induction chemotherapy and long term outcomes (PFS and OS) and compare them to pathologic measures of response (pCRR)\n\nPROCEDURES This is a single-arm, nonrandomized phase II trial consisting of 3 parts. After informed consent and screening, pre-induction, risk levels will be assessed clinically, by a combination of physical exam and imaging.\n\nPart 1: All patients will then receive 6 weeks of induction chemotherapy in Part 1 comprised of weekly cycles of carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel for 6 cycles in combination with durvalumab administered once every two weeks for 5 cycles (Day 1 of the weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9).\n\nPart 2: Within a 1-4 the week window post induction, tumor imaging will be followed by surgical resection.\n\nPart 3: After surgery, patients will be stratified into one of 3 risk categories based on their disease pathology, assigned a treatment group based on their risk. Low risk patients with receive durvalumab once every two weeks for 3 cycles, while medium risk or high risks groups will receive concurrent chemoradiation therapy followed by durvalumab once every two weeks for 3 cycles.\n\nFollow up After completion of study therapy (which will vary by study arm) patients will be evaluated every three months during follow up for progression over a period of 18 months. Each follow up visit will include physical examination, CT or MRI imaging of the neck. Chest imaging will be obtained (or not) as indicated by standard of care. After the first 18 months, patients will be followed-up per standard of care, with documentation in the case report form (CRF) limited to progression and survival noted at their standard of care visits.

    "detailed_description": "HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) is a gene that can play a role in the development of breast cancer. Genes like HER2 and the proteins they make influence how a breast cancer behaves and how it might respond to a specific treatment.\n\nA score of 0 on the HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) test indicates that breast tissue is HER2-negative. Drugs that fight cancer by targeting the growth of HER2 genes, such as the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, have not traditionally been used in patients with HER2-negative tumors because trastuzumab works by attaching to HER2 and stopping cancer cells from growing and dividing. However, about half of breast cancers that are categorized as HER2-negative like yours, actually have low expression of HER2. and recent research has shown that newer generations of antibody-drug conjugates like trastuzumab show considerable survival benefit even in tumors that are not classified as HER2-positive.\n\nAn antibody-drug conjugates is a combination of a monoclonal antibody like trastuzumab with an anticancer agent like deruxtecan. This combination that interrupts DNA replication in cancer cells. Antibody-drug conjugates like (T-DXd) are designed to target and kill cancer cells while sparing healthy cells.\n\nPrior research that has shown that the antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has outstanding activity and survival benefit in HER2-low breast cancers.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to help us learn more about which patients might benefit most from T-DXd through a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study to assess the safety and efficacy of T-DXd in HER2-negative subjects with unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer.\n\nThe researchers will measure the response to the T-DXd (the percentage of patients with complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease). Researchers will also look for biomarkers to determine the most accurate way to predict which patients without HER2-positive breast cancer will benefit the most from T-DXd.\n\nT-DXd has been FDA approved to treat adults with unresectable or metastatic HER2-low breast cancer who have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nEach treatment cycle is 21 days.",

    "detailed_description": "Gastrooesophageal (GOA) cancer is a common, global cancer which often presents at an advanced stage. Those diagnosed early will generally have neoadjuvant treatment with FLOT chemotherapy followed by surgery followed by the same FLOT chemotherapy post surgery. Treatment however is curative in less than 50%.\n\nCirculating tumour DNA (ctDNA) is found in the bloodstream. It refers to DNA that comes from cancerous cells and tumours. If ctDNA is positive it means that there are microscopic traces of tumour in the bloodstream (minimal residual disease). Patients who are ctDNA positive after chemotherapy and surgery are less likely to benefit from further FLOT chemotherapy and more likely to relapse.\n\nHER2 positive describes cells that have a protein called HER2 on their surface. In normal cells, HER2 helps control cell growth. Cancer cells that make too much HER2 may grow more quickly and are more likely to spread to other parts of the body.\n\nTrastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is an antibody that targets HER2 cells. It attaches to the HER2 cells on the tumour and destroys them. In the UK, trastuzumab deruxtecan (Enhertu) is currently offered to patients with advanced breast cancer who are HER2 positive. In the US, Israel and Japan it is licenced in patients with advanced HER2 positive GOA.\n\nDECIPHER aims to treat patient's with GOA post-surgery who are both HER2 and ctDNA positive with trastuzumab deruxtecan (Enhertu) instead of standard care FLOT chemotherapy. The aim of the trial is to treat the minimal residual disease reducing the chance of relapse. All trial patients will be followed for up to 2 years to record their response to treatment. 25 patients will be recruited over 18 months.\n\nPatients will be treated with 6.4 mg/kg trastuzumab deruxtecan every 21 days for 8 cycles.",

Emergency Room visits for asthma management across Alberta have been reviewed and it has been found that adults frequently need to return for repeated worsening. This is a large drain on health care resources as well as being very distressing for individuals with asthma. Occasionally this results in admission to hospital and rarely may lead to death. People are often treated with steroids to try to prevent the need for Emergency Room visits even though steroid medications have many long term bad side effects.\n\nA new medication for patients considered to have severe asthma has been recently approved by Health Canada. This medication, Tezepelumab, is a monthly injection and it helps control asthma in adults regardless of the underlying cause. The study will examine if starting Tezepelumab, compared with a placebo, in the Emergency Room will help settle symptoms of asthma and prevent future worsening requiring repeated Emergency Room visits or the need for courses of outpatient steroid medications.",
    "detailed_description": "All patients with a physician-diagnosed history of asthma and a history of a moderate or severe exacerbation of asthma presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with an acute exacerbation of asthma will be reviewed by a study coordinator. From this population, subjects with at least 3-month history of prescription for a high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus a reliever medication such as a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA), long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) or a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LRTA) will be approached for study enrolment while still within the ED. Following informed consent, subject will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either Tezepelumab 210 mg S/Q Q4W or to a marching placebo. The proportion of subjects returning to ED for an exacerbation of asthma by Day-90 will serve as the primary study outcome. After Day-90 subjects will be entered into an open-label study with all receiving Tezepelumab 210 mg S/Q Q4W. A key secondary outcome will be the proportion of subjects returning to ED for an exacerbation of asthma by Day-180. Other secondary outcomes will include Alarmin expression, ACQ-5, FEV1 as well as study drug safety and tolerability",

Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is an antibody that is being studied in several other clinical trials to see if it has an effect in helping the immune system to recognize and eliminate abnormal cells in the body.\n\nInvestigators hope that decitabine may increase the chance of the immune system to recognize the cancer cells.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are looking for the highest effective dose of decitabine in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736) to improve the natural ability of the immune system to recognize and target head and neck cancer cells.",

However, there is an unmet need to identify which patients are unlikely to benefit. Deciding on benefit from therapy uses standard imaging methods (e.g. CT scans), which can take time (months) whereas DNA in the bloodstream could be measured more rapidly.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to assess whether changes in the level of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) can quickly determine a patients response. This would enable patients to change therapies more quickly if they are not responding and reduce exposure to unnecessary side effects.",

By measuring ctDNA at different time points the investigators can detect tumour changes that indicate if the patient is responding to treatment or not.\n\nThis trial has been designed as a prospective, open label, non-randomised trial where patient with advanced oesophageal cancer will be treated with MEDI4736 (durvalumab), a drug designed to alter the immune system response. Samples will be taken to regularly to measure ctDNA levels and compared to patients response at 6 months when undergoing standard CT scans.\n\nThe study will run at a single centre (Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge). Nineteen, evaluable, patients will receive durvalumab until progression while detailed studies will assess their tumour and immune response.",

Need for adjuvant therapy is most marked in the high risk population where outcomes are predictably poor. However, the risk of recurrence in patients who are of intermediate risk of recurrence is not insignificant. Unfortunately, despite showing efficacy in advanced RCC, the results in the adjuvant setting, so far, are inconclusive.\n\nAIM: RAMPART is a phase III Multi-Arm Multi-Stage randomised controlled platform trial, initiated with three arms. The trial is assessing if durvalumab monotherapy or the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab can improve Disease Free Survival (DFS) or Overall Survival (OS) compared to the current global standard-of-care (active monitoring). At the start of recruitment, patients with Leibovich scores 3 to 11 will be eligible for randomisation. Accrual of intermediate risk patients (Leibovich scores 3 5) will stop after 3 years or when intermediate risk patients contribute 25% of the total accrual target, whichever is earlier. Recruitment of patients with Leibovich scores 6 to 11 will continue until the accrual target is reached.",

    "brief_summary": "Liver cancer is a highly lethal malignancy and has become increasingly important in western countries. The management of liver cancer is complex. In advanced disease, two combinations of immunotherapies are recommanded as first line (atezolizumab-bevacizumab or durvalumab-tremelimumab). Results in patients with high tumor burden (Portal vein thrombosis Vp3 or Vp4, or tumoral liver involvement \\>50%) are less impressive. Innovative combinations are necessary to improve the outcome of patients.\n\nRecently, control trials conducted in Asia highlighted the benefit of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, especially in patients with high tumor burden. Studies including a limited number of patients shown that the combination seems feasible.\n\nALICE is a randomized multicentric Phase II/Phase III trial conducted in French medical centers, evaluating the efficacy and safety of durvalumab+tremelimumab with or without Hepatic Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy of the GEMOX regimen (gemcitabine + oxaliplatin), in patients with high tumor burden.\n\nOxaliplatin induce immunogenic cell death, and gemcitabin deplete regulatory immune cells. The GEMOX regimen thus has the potential for a synergic effect with immunotherapy in HCC.\n\nThe trial will provide an innovative treatment to patients with no alternative for locoregional treatment, and with limited results with actual systemic treatments. It will also be the first trial of Hepatic Arterial infusion for such patients in the western population.",

    "brief_summary": "Accelerated, normofractionated radiotherapy is the treatment of choice in stage II-III laryngeal and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). However, twenty to thirty percent of patients with stage II-III laryngeal and HPV negative oropharyngeal SCC develop disease progression, mainly due to lack of locoregional control. Radiosensitizers such as cisplatin and cetuximab are added to radiotherapy in more advanced stage of head and neck (H\\&N) cancer. These radiosensitizers improve loco-regional control and overall survival. Unfortunately, as these radiosensitizers, notably cisplatin, also dose intensify the radiation dose in normal tissues, they also significantly increase toxicity. Adding a more tumor-specific radiosensitizing agent could improve loco-regional control and overall survival without significantly increasing toxicity.\n\nRadiotherapy kills tumor cells by inducing DNA damage. The efficacy of radiotherapy is limited by the ability of tumor cells to repair this DNA damage. Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) is an essential enzyme in base excision repair and single strand break DNA repair, DNA lesions arising from radiation treatment. PARP inhibition and consequently the inhibition of PARP-facilitated DNA repair enhances the anti-tumor activity of radiotherapy, as shown in preclinical studies including head and neck xenograft studies. This radiosensitization is thought to be proliferation dependent and is more pronounced in homologous recombination (HR) deficient cells, providing an opportunity for tumor specific targeting. Genetic analyses suggest that HR deficiency is commonly found in H\\&N SCC: ATM loss has been reported in 60% of human H\\&N SCC biopsies and FANC-F defects were reported in 15-21% of human H\\&N SCC biopsies and cell lines.\n\nThe efficacy of radiotherapy is also limited by tumor hypoxia, as tumor hypoxia results in radioresistance. Some PARP inhibiting compounds increase tumor perfusion in xenograft models, thereby reducing hypoxia and specifically sensitizing tumor cells to radiotherapy. Hypoxia is commonly found in H\\&N SCC and a high pre-treatment hypoxic fraction in H\\&N SCC tumors is associated with worse outcome. The high prevalence of both hypoxia and HR deficiencies in H\\&N SCC support the concept of tumor-specific radiosensitization by PARP inhibition in head and neck cancer patients.\n\nOlaparib is a potent PARP inhibitor developed as an anti-cancer drug for HR defected tumors and as a dose intensifier for chemo- and radiotherapy. In humans, olaparib has a low toxicity profile as a single agent, with increasing bone marrow toxicity when combined with chemotherapy. The combination of olaparib and radiotherapy for H\\&N SCC is expected to improve locoregional control and thereby overall survival. However, this combination treatment has never been tested in humans before. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of radiotherapy for stage II-III laryngeal and stage II-III HPV-negative oropharyngeal SCC with concurrent olaparib.",

Patients will receive up to 24 weeks of durvalumab (a PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor) in combination with S-488210/S-488211 (a 5-peptide cancer vaccine).\n\nDurvalumab will be given as 1500 mg IV infusion every 4 weeks for up to 7 doses, in combination with S-488210/S-S488211 which will be administered as two subcutaneous injections of S-488210/Montanide and S-488211/Montanide starting the day after the first durvalumab dose, then weekly for 6 doses and every 2 weeks for a further 9 doses (up to a maximum of 16 doses).\n\nAll patients must have a cystoscopy at the end of week 12 (from start of trial treatment) for disease evaluation and to assess suitability to continue trial treatment. Patients with complete response, as shown from the cystoscopy, may continue treatment for up to 24 weeks in the absence of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent; all other patient will be withdrawn from further trial treatment.\n\nThe phase Ib part of the DURANCE study will look to assess the safety and tolerability of the treatment combination of durvalumab + S-488210/S-488211 by reviewing Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) which have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to the trial treatments (durvalumab and/or S-488210/S-488211). Up to 14 evaluable patients will be registered into phase Ib and provided the DLTs do not exceed the DLT thresholds defined in the trial protocol, the trial will proceed to the expansion phase of the study (phase 2). In phase 2 the trial will look to assess the disease free survival rate at 1 year following start of treatment.",

    "brief_summary": "Lung cancer is a highly prevalent disease worldwide in women and men. In 2022, lung cancer stood as the most frequently diagnosed cancer with approximately 2.48 million new cases on a global scale, followed by cancers of the female breast (11.6%), colorectum (9.6%), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (4.9%).\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide according to data provided by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. In 2022 they estimated a 1.8 million deaths across the world. Specifically in Spain, from 1980 to 2022, lung cancer led to 745,182 deaths.\n\nHistologically, lung cancer (LC) can be classified into two major subtypes: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), accounting for 85% and 15% of LC patients, respectively. Smoking is the major risk factor for SCLC.\n\nThere are two stages of SCLC: limited-stage SCLC (LS-SCLC) and extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). Limited-stage (LS) means that the cancer is located on the ipsilateral hemithorax that can be encompassed within a radiation port while extensive-stage (ES) means that the cancer has spread widely throughout the lungs, to non-regional lymph nodes or to other organs. At present, LS is identified in \\~30% of patients, and ES is identified in \\~70% of patients with SCLC.\n\nWith a 5-year survival rate of less than 7%, SCLC is still one of the most lethal malignancies and it is also characterized by early metastatic spread. Reflecting this high metastatic capacity, two thirds of patients already have tumor cell dissemination outside the chest at the time of initial diagnosis (ES-SCLC). Therefore, the number of patients with LS-SCLC who can benefit from multimodality therapy with potentially curative intent is limited. SCLC is a highly aggressive form of LC that typically recurs and progresses rapidly despite initial response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with LS-SCLC.\n\nThe etoposide/platinum (EP) combination was the standard of care (SoC) for patients with ES-SCLC until 2019, when the addition of immunotherapy to EP chemotherapy was shown to improve survival, with up to 17% of patients remaining alive at 3 years. On the other hand, the SoC for patients with LS-SCLC is concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) \u00b1 prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) that remained unchanged for decades. Several studies have shown that concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) is more effective than sequential CRT (sCRT) in LS-SCLC. Nonetheless, subject to the lymph node regions involvement and treatment-related toxicities, some patients do not undergo concurrent CRT and instead receive sequential CRT. In a non-interventional, retrospective cohort study of limited-stage SCLC patients conducted in France, Italy and the UK, sequential chemoradiotherapy accounts for 37.6% of all treatment patterns while concurrent chemoradiotherapy accounts for 35.1% of the whole therapies used as first line.\n\nADRIATIC (NCT03703297) is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, global study evaluating durvalumab \u00b1 tremelimumab as consolidation therapy for patients with LS-SCLC who have not progressed after cCRT. Positive high-level results of the ADRIATIC clinical trial showed durvalumab demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the dual primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with LS-SCLC who had not progressed following cCRT compared to placebo. Durvalumab was well tolerated, and AEs were consistent with the known safety profile. These data support the consolidation of durvalumab as a new SoC for patients with LS-SCLC who have not progressed after cCRT.\n\nThere is limited information on the effectiveness and safety of durvalumab in a broader patient population with LS-SCLC, including those who received sequential CRT.\n\nTherefore, there remains an unmet need for additional data to help support and inform the healthcare decisions on the use of durvalumab as consolidation treatment for patients with LS-SCLC in real-world clinical practice. In addition, ADRIATIC study did not allow to include patients with ECOG PS 2 assessed after CRT.\n\nThe present phase IIIb study will assess the safety and effectiveness of durvalumab in real world like LS-SCLC population. Furthermore, this trial will focus on patient characteristics, treatment exposure, administration, quality of life (QoL), effectiveness and safety providing insights into durvalumab use.",

Smoking is the major risk factor for SCLC.\n\nSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents approximately 14% of all newly diagnosed lung cancers. SCLC is perhaps the most aggressive form of the disease, distinguishable from non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by its rapid doubling time, high growth fraction, and early dissemination. It is strongly associated with tobacco smoking and is also associated with an extremely high mutation rate. Moreover, inactivation of TP53 and RB1 occurs frequently, and in a recent study in which sequencing of SCLC tumors was carried out, recurrent mutations were identified in the CREBBP, EP300, and MLL genes that encode histone modifiers. Furthermore, mutations in PTEN, SLIT2, and EPHA7 (as well as focal amplifications of the FGFR1 tyrosine kinase gene) were also observed.\n\nA 2-stage system dividing patients into limited and extensive disease was developed in 1973 by the United States (US) Veteran\u00b4s Administration Lung Cancer Study Group. Limited stage was defined as tumor tissue that could be encompassed in a single radiation port, and extensive-stage (ES) disease was defined as any tumor that extended beyond the boundaries of a single radiation port. At present, limited stage is identified in \\~30% of patients, and ES is identified in \\~70% of patients.\n\nThe SoC treatment for LS-SCLC is thoracic radiotherapy (once daily with a total dose of 60 to 66 Gy or twice daily with a total dose of 45 Gy) combined with 4 cycles of either cisplatin or carboplatin and etoposide chemotherapy. In addition, data suggest that prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI; for patients that respond to initial therapy) may increase the OS and PFS in LS-SCLC patients. Response rates for concurrent CRT in LS-SCLC are approximately 90%, but the majority of patients eventually progress, with median PFS of 10 to 15 months and median OS of 15 to 30 months. Therefore, there is still a significant unmet medical need for additional treatment options for this patient population to improve PFS and OS.\n\nCurrently, the 5-year survival rate is approximately 20%-25% for LS-SCLC and barely 1%-2% for ES-SCLC, making SCLC one of the deadliest cancers.\n\nSCLC may be particularly susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy given the high mutational burden of this disease. Several recent studies analysing data from different tumor types have demonstrated a correlation between mutational burden and response to checkpoint inhibitors targeting both PD-1 and CTLA-4.\n\nADRIATIC (NCT03703297) is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, global study evaluating durvalumab \u00b1 tremelimumab as consolidation therapy for patients with LS-SCLC who have not progressed after cCRT.

    "brief_summary": "As in other solid tumours, increasing evidence indicates that patients diagnosed with a limited number of prostate cancer metastases, so-called oligometastases, have a better prognosis compared with patients with extensive metastatic disease.\n\nSurvival of patients with three or fewer metastases was superior compared with patients with more than three lesions.\n\nThe introduction of novel imaging modalities such as Fluorocholine (FCH), Fuciclovine or Ga-PSMA PET CT has increased the detection of oligometastatic prostate cancer (PCa) recurrence, potentially justifying the use of a metastasis-directed therapy with radiotherapy (RT).\n\nBased on several studies, SBRT is now considered as a strongly validated option in oligometastatic prostate cancer.\n\nIt is increasingly understood that cancers are recognized by the immune system, and, under some circumstances, the immune system may control or even eliminate tumors.\n\nProgrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is transmembrane protein that has been speculated to play a major role in suppressing the immune system during particular events.\n\nPD-L1 is expressed in a broad range of cancers. Based on these findings, an anti-PD-L1 antibody could be used therapeutically to enhance antitumor immune responses in patients with cancer.\n\nExperimental data from multiple cancer models have provided cumulative evidence of an interaction of ionizing radiation with the systemic antitumor immunity and this has created several opportunities in the field.\n\nThe oligometastatic setting appears to be the most relevant clinical situation to evaluate the immune response generated by radiotherapy and immune modifiers in patients with an intact immune system. The hypothesize is that Durvalumab will enhance immune response following SBRT targeting oligometastatic lesions. In this randomized 2:1 phase II trial of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy with or without durvalumab in oligometastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer patients, Durvalumab will be started one month prior to SBRT to be able to evaluate PSA and immune response to the drug. It will be combined with SBRT and then given adjuvantly for a total of 12 months.",

This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in children \\<18 years of age.\n\nPrimary Objective: Correction phase (CP) primary objective:\n\n1. To evaluate the ability to achieve normokalaemia during the CP when initiating treatment with SZC of different dose levels (DLs) in children with hyperkalaemia 28-day Maintenance Phase (MP) primary objective:\n2. To evaluate the ability to maintain normokalaemia during the MP when continuing SZC treatment in children achieving normokalaemia\n\n   Secondary Objectives: All phases secondary objective:\n3. To evaluate the change in S-K+ in children treated with SZC\n\n   MP secondary objectives:\n4. To evaluate change in serum aldosterone levels in children treated with SZC during the MP\n5. To evaluate change in serum electrolytes (including bicarbonate), spot urinary pH and urinary electrolytes levels in children treated with SZC during the MP\n\n   Long-term MP (LTMP) secondary objectives:\n6.

To evaluate the acceptability and palatability of SZC through the study\n\nOverall design: This is a Phase 3, international, multi-centre, open-label study assessing different doses of SZC. The population to be studied is hyperkalaemic children \\< 18 years. Dosing will mirror the regimen approved for adults using body weight equivalent doses. Enrolment will start in 2 cohorts, ages 6 to \\< 12 years and 12 to \\< 18 years. After review of accumulated data, the independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will recommend whether to open enrolment in the ages 2 to \\< 6 years cohort and later in the ages 0 to \\< 2 years cohort.\n\nThe study will be conducted in approximately 11 countries and 46 sites. All eligible participants with hyperkalaemia will enter an open-label Correction Phase (CP) receiving a fixed dose of SZC three times daily (TID) for up to 3 days until normokalaemia is achieved. Within each age cohorts 2 to \\< 18 years, initial participants will be allocated to the dose level (DL) based on body weight equivalent to an adult 5 g TID.

During MP, the Investigator is able to titrate the dose up or down in the range 2.5 g to 15 g body weight equivalent to maintain normokalaemia. The MP is followed by the option for participants to continue the study in a long-term maintenance phase (LTMP) where the same titration regimen is used as in MP, but with monthly visits.\n\nStudy period: Estimated date of first participant enter the CP Q4 2018. Estimated date of last participant completed 27 December 2024.\n\nNumber of participants: This study aims to enter into CP a total of approximately 140 participants with hyperkalaemia. Of these, approximately 85 participants are expected to have moderate to severe hyperkalaemia. Enrolment will continue until at least 54 participants with moderate to severe hyperkalaemia have entered the MP and 45 participants with moderate to severe hyperkalaemia have completed the MP. A maximum of 55 participants with mild hyperkalaemia will enter the CP. In addition, there are minimum requirements for participants in each age cohort\n\nDuration: Study duration is approximately 28 weeks including up to 3 days of correction treatment, followed by maintenance treatment for 28 days, a LTMP for up to 22 weeks, and a safety follow-up visit 1 week after the last dose.\n\nTreatments and treatment duration:\n\nTreatment will include 3 phases: the CP, MP, and LTMP. All age cohorts are eligible to participate in all phases of the study. The 3 treatment phases are specified below:\n\nCorrection phase (CP): All eligible participants with hyperkalaemia will enter an open-label Correction Phase (CP) receiving a fixed dose of SZC three times daily (TID) for up to 3 days until normokalaemia is achieved. Within each age cohorts 2 to \\< 18 years, initial participants will be allocated to the dose level (DL) 5 g TID. After recommendation of higher DLs by the iDMC, subsequent participants may be allocated in the CP to 10 g TID and then potentially 15 g TID. All participants in the ages 0 to \\< 2 years cohort will be assigned to the same DL which will be decided based on data from older age cohorts.\n\nMaintenance phase (MP): Participants who successfully achieve normokalaemia in the CP will enter a 28-day open-label Maintenance Phase (MP), which will be initiated with once daily administration of the dose received TID in the CP. During MP, the Investigator is able to titrate the dose up or down in the range 2.5 g to 15 g body weight equivalent to maintain normokalaemia.\n\nLong term Maintenance Phase (LTMP): For participants who, at the end of MP, are normokalaemic or hyperkalaemic without being on maximum dose, the MP is followed by the option to continue the study in a long term maintenance phase (LTMP) where the same titration regimen is used as in MP.\n\nData Monitoring Committee:\n\nThe iDMC will recommend on the opening of dose levels during the CP after reviewing all available data. Additionally, iDMC will recommend whether and when enrolment in the ages 0 to \\< 6 years cohorts will begin, and will also evaluate emerging safety data during all phases of the study.\n\nStatistical methods: Objectives will be evaluated based on analysis populations corresponding to each study phase. Analysis sets are defined for each phase as the set of all participants who transitioned from previous phase and who received at least one dose of SZC during the phase. Primary assessments of the primary objectives, the probability to achieve and maintain normokalaemia when treated with SZC, will be based on point estimates together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from generalised linear models (repeated measures model for the MP). The secondary objective of change in S-K+ over time will be evaluated using a repeated measures linear model. Additional analyses, including analyses for other secondary objectives, will be done descriptively. In general, data will be analysed in the total analysis population, within each age cohort and, for the CP, within adult body weight equivalent dose-level, as appropriate. An interim read-out may be conducted.",

    "brief_summary": "Currently, the standard of care treatment for newly diagnosed, inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer is radiotherapy (RT) with concurrent chemotherapy, followed by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). RT is a highly effect local treatment. However, high doses of radiation used in curative settings can cause adverse side effects. The most common RT side effect in lung cancer is Radiation Induced Lung Injury (RILI), which can manifest as pneumonitis and/or pulmonary fibrosis. Lung injury can negatively impact patients' well-being and quality of life, and may lead to increased mortality. Risk of lung injury is particularly increased when patients are treated with a combination of treatments (i.e., RT, chemotherapy, and ICI). The drug Pentoxifylline (in combination with \u03b1-Tocopherol (Vitamin E)) has been shown to prevent/alter the progression of lung injury and there is a growing body of evidence to support the safety and efficacy of phosphodiesterase inhibitors in cancer treatment. The proposed study aims to determine if the addition of Pentoxifylline, given in combination with \u03b1-Tocopherol (Vitamin E), to standard of care treatment will reduce side effects related to lung injury and improve quality of life in this study population.",
