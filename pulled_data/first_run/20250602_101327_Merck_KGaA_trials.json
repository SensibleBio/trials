Typical brain lesions of the disease may be partially repaired by an endogenous remyelination process which is limited and tends to deplete over the course of the disease. Cladribine tablets are an approved treatment that promotes selective lymphocyte depletion, reducing the inflammatory activity of the disease. The present study is based on the hypothesis that improved inflammatory control through cladribine tablets provides a tissue microenvironment more favorable for remyelination of brain lesions in MS. This hypothesis will be evaluated by a single-arm, open-label, phase IV, single-center, proof-of-concept clinical trial in which 10 participants with relapsing-remitting, highly active MS, relatively early in the course of the disease, will receive conventional treatment with cladribine tablets and will be followed-up for 48 months. Neurological, neuropsychological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters will be measured. Remyelination will be assessed by a novel MRI technique called the q-Space myelin map. Additionally, the peripheral blood lymphocyte and cytokine profiles will be evaluated in order to understand the immunological aspects that influence the remyelination capacity in patients treated with cladribine tablets. The study will be conducted in accordance with current regulations governing clinical research in Brazil.",

    "brief_summary": "Dementia is the main cause of disability in older adults, currently affecting about 50 million people world-wide with this number estimated to triple in the next 30 years. In MET-FINGER, we aim to understand whether the FINGER 2.0 multidomain intervention, combining healthy lifestyle changes and a drug for diabetes (metformin), may help reduce the risk of dementia and improve health and independence among older adults.\n\nThe study primary objective is to test the effect of the intervention, compared to healthy lifestyle advice, on the change in cognition, measured as a composite score including 14 of neuropsychological/cognitive tests. The secondary objective is to test the intervention effect on change in individual cognitive domains, functioning level, and risk factors for dementia (e.g., lifestyle, medical, and psychosocial). To this aim, a range of personal/health-related data and blood samples, will be collected. Potential interactions between metformin and lifestyle changes; potential disease-modifying effects; and feasibility of the metformin + lifestyle combination will be explored.\n\n600 older people with risk factors for dementia, but without dementia/substantial cognitive impairment, will be recruited in the United Kingdom, Finland, and Sweden (at least 50% with higher genetic risk of Alzheimer's Disease/dementia based on the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene). Participants will be randomly assigned 1:1 to either a self-guided multidomain lifestyle intervention or to the FINGER 2.0 multidomain lifestyle-based intervention. Outcome assessors will be blinded to group allocation. Within the FINGER 2.0 intervention group, participants at increased risk of diabetes, will be randomly assigned 1:1:1 to either the metformin 2000mg/day, metformin 1000mg/day, or placebo group (double blinded). The intervention duration is 24 months.\n\nThe lifestyle intervention includes four main components: physical exercise, diet, brain training and health checks. In the self-guided group, participants will create their own program, based on health advice and recommendations which will be provided during the study. In the FINGER 2.0 intervention group, participants will receive intensive lifestyle guidance, and participate in structured activities, which will be as tailored as possible on each person's daily habits and needs.\n\nOver the 2-year study period, all participants will attend four assessment visits: baseline, 6-, 12-, and 24-months.",
    "detailed_description": "After being identified and pre-screened in relevant registers, potential participants will undergo a screening assessment (after providing informed consent for the screening procedures) where inclusion criteria related to both cognition and cardiovascular/lifestyle risk factors will be checked. Participants meeting the inclusion criteria will undergo the exclusion criteria assessment with the study physician.\n\nEligible participants will be invited to the baseline visit where informed consent for the full study will be signed, baseline assessment will be conducted, and participants will be randomized to either the FINGER 2.0 multidomain lifestyle-based intervention or self-guided multidomain lifestyle intervention group. Based on the results of the baseline assessment, the eligibility to the metformin/placebo treatment will be assessed in all participants randomized to the FINGER 2.0 intervention group. Eligible participants will be further randomized to one of the three metformin treatment groups (metformin 2000mg/day, metformin 1000mg/day, or placebo). Non eligible participants will continue the study by following the structured lifestyle intervention alone.\n\nIn the self-guided intervention group, participants will build their own healthy lifestyle program based on standard healthy lifestyle advice that they will receive at individual consultations with the study physician/nurse as part of the visits.\n\nWithin the FINGER 2.0 intervention group, participants will be invited to attend individual consultations and group meeting sessions in relation to the four intervention components (diet, physical activity, cognitive training, and cardiovascular/metabolic risk monitoring). As part of the physical activity component, group training sessions with a physiotherapist/professional trainer will be organized both at a gym as well as online. Within the cognitive training component, participants will have access to an online cognitive training program for independent training sessions. Individually tailored recommendations and plans will be provided to each participant.\n\nMetformin and placebo will be dispensed every 3 months, both administered orally. The active drug is Glucophage\u00ae XR 500. All participants randomized to the metformin/placebo groups will receive 4 identical tablets per day as follows:\n\n* 2000mg/day: 4x500mg metformin\n* 1000mg/day: 2x500mg metformin + 2x500mg placebo\n* Placebo: 4x500mg placebo.\n\nMetformin will be titrated weekly from 500mg/day up to 2000mg/day over 4 weeks. Participants who do not tolerate the treatment will be allowed to remain in the study either in a lower dose treatment group, or receiving the structured lifestyle intervention only.\n\nParticipants will not be actively told to what lifestyle intervention group they have been assigned and assessors for primary and secondary outcomes will be blinded to the lifestyle group allocation. The metformin/placebo treatment will be conducted in double blind.",

Recently bladder preservation strategies have emerged as an alternative to radical cystectomy, particularly useful for patients who are unfit for surgery or would rather opt for non-surgical approaches. Knowing the high risks related to surgery and its significant complications, the investigators propose to implement 2 tetra-modalities treatment strategies to increase the chance of preserving the bladder and decrease the need of salvage cystectomy.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of 2 bladder-preservation treatments plans called tetra-modalities:\n\nFirst plan:\n\n* maximium TURBT\n* chemo-immunotherapy as induction phase (Avelumab added to chemotherapy)\n* radiation therapy\n* maintenance phase with Avelumab\n\nSecond plan:\n\n* Maximum TURBT\n* chemo-immunotherapy as induction phase (Avelumab added to chemotherapy)\n* radiation therapy\n* Watch and wait\n\nBoth tetra-modalities duration will last maximum of 2 years from patient inclusion.\n\nThese treatment plans are based on the synergistic action between immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The use of Avelumab in the maintenance group is supported by its proven success in treating advanced cancer and various studies looking at immunotherapy as a way to avoid or delay bladder removal.",

Advanced H\\&N cancer which has come back after treatment or has spread to other parts of the body is incurable and the average life expectancy of these patients is less than a year. New drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors work with the patient's own immune system to fight cancer. They are used in the clinic to treat a number of cancers, including H\\&N cancer. It may be possible to make immune checkpoint inhibitors more effective by combining drugs that work in different ways. In effect, attacking the cancer from different angles. Cetuximab is a well-established drug that works by blocking signals that tell cancer cells to grow and divide into more cells. It also engages with the immune system within the tumour. The trial aims to see if giving cetuximab along with an immune checkpoint inhibitor drug called avelumab is better at treating advanced H\\&N cancer than giving avelumab on its own.\n\nThese two drugs have not been given together before, so to start with, the investigator plans to enrol a small number of patients and give the patients avelumab + cetuximab to make sure the combination is safe at the doses chosen. After this, the investigator plans to enrol 114 patients with advanced H\\&N cancer. Half the patients will be treated with avelumab alone and the other half with avelumab + cetuximab. Both drugs are given intravenously in the hospital once every 2 weeks.\n\nTreatment lasts for up to a year and patients will be followed up for up to 2 years from the time they enter the study. Patients will be recruited from around 15 hospitals in the UK. Recruitment would be expected to start in the second quarter of 2018 and it will take about 29 months (Safety run-in: 5 months; Phase II: 24 months) to recruit all the patients.",

The randomised phase II part of the trial will be preceded by a safety run-in.The objective of the safety run in is to make sure the combination of cetuximab and avelumab at the doses selected for the study are safe and tolerable.\n\nIn phase II, the main question the investigator wants to answer is whether or not giving avelumab and cetuximab together is better than giving avelumab alone to treat patients with head and neck cancer that have had previous treatment with cisplatin and whose cancer has come back or spread to other parts of the body. The investigator will compare the number of patients in each group whose cancer has not gotten any worse 6 months after joining the study.\n\nThe phase II part of the trial will recruit patients with head \\& neck squamous cell carcinoma only. However, during the safety run-in, patients with other types of squamous cell carcinomas will also be eligible.\n\nTarget accrual:\n\nSafety run-in: up to 16 patients with squamous cell carcinomas; Phase II: 114 patients with head \\& neck squamous cell cancer\n\nThe safety run-in will recruit patients in cohorts of 3 at a time and all patients will be treated with the combination. The safety run in is a dose de-escalation design. That is, patients will be given the dose that is planed for use in phase II and if this proves not tolerable, the dose of cetuximab will be de-escalated and another cohort of patients will be recruited. The investigator will conclude the combination is safe and tolerable if less than 33% of patients who are treated experience side effects that lead to a dose reduction. The purpose is to ensure the safety of the combination prior to starting phase II, as these drugs have not been given together before. However, there is evidence from previous studies that these types of drugs can be combined safely. The trial aims to complete the safety run-in within 5 months and the phase II study within 24 months. The entire duration of recruitment is expected to be 29 months.",

    "brief_summary": "Lack of adherence to treatment is a widespread issue worldwide, which leads to higher healthcare utilisation rates and even premature death. While the level of adherence may differ based on the specific condition and treatment, studies estimate that approximately 50% of medications are not taken according to the prescribed instructions. In addition, adherence rates tend to decrease even further when the treatment requires a behavioural change. Literature reviews about factors that affect people's adherence show that it is challenging to predict whom can be considered to have adherent and non-adherent behaviours. In addition, the studies highlight that it is challenging to support a person to be adherent. Based on this knowledge the BEAMER project was established (Behavioural and Adherence Model for improving quality, health outcomes and cost-Effectiveness of healthcaRe). The overall goal of the project is to improve the quality of life of individuals, enhance healthcare accessibility and sustainability, thereby transforming the way healthcare stakeholders engage with patients to understand their condition and adherence levels throughout their healthcare journey. To address the overall goal, the BEAMER project has developed a disease agnostic model named \"B-COMPASS: BEAMER-COmputational Model for Patient Adherence and Support Solutions\". The aim of the B-COMPASS is to identify patients' needs and preferences which enables the creation of patient-specific supports, with the intention of improving their adherence to treatment within the heterogeneity of the different disease-areas and healthcare contexts. Based on the validated BEAMER questionnaire, the B-COMPASS predicts relative adherence and offers an elicitation process of patient needs and preferences to enable targeted supports to improve patient adherence. This results in an allocation of patients to different groups based on their needs and preferences. Overall, the B-COMPASS provides patient insights that will enable more effective design of patient support, most likely resulting in better patient experience, improved adherence and lower healthcare and societal costs.\n\nSo far, several activities from a technical and user perspective have already been conducted in the project to refine the B-COMPASS. This has been done by applying an iterative mixed method approach were both stakeholders (regulator, pharma, academic/research and small and medium-sized enterprises) and end users (patients, health providers and health systems) have been involved. Despite the finetuning of the B-COMPASS, the effectiveness of the B-COMPASS hinges on empirical investigations into the structural elements that impact patient behaviour and the identification of predictive factors that can assist healthcare providers' (HCP) and Research Leads in designing more effective treatment plans (the term HCPs/Research Lead include both the individuals and the institutions where care is delivered). Therefore, validation studies will be conducted to assess the B-COMPASS's performance in six therapeutic areas (cardiovascular, endocrinology, immunology, neurology, oncology and rare diseases) with patients recruited in at least Italy (FISM), Portugal (APDP and MEDIDA) Norway (AHUS), Spain (FHUNJ and FIIBAP), The Netherlands (WDO), and Germany (UDUS). The collected data will be used to evaluate the B-COMPASS's capacity to attend to a variety of needs and challenges for adherence.",
    "detailed_description": "The aim of the study is to validate the B-COMPASS in real-life settings. Overall, the purpose is to provide evidence 1) to validate the B-COMPASS (primary purpose), and 2) to demonstrate the effectiveness and implementability of the B-COMPASS (secondary purpose). The project will carry out the final iterative steps of refining the model, guided by the validation studies that have been conducted. This process will be based on evaluating the performance of the generic model across six selected therapeutic areas (cardiovascular, endocrinology, immunology, neurology, oncology and rare diseases). Study participants (patients and HCPs) will be recruited (at least) from Italy, Portugal, Norway, Spain, The Netherlands, and Germany, and the validation will evaluate the capacity to attend to a variety of needs and challenges for adherence to treatment.\n\nOverall, the study has 8 Scientific Questions (SQs), where SQ 1-4 address the validity of the B-COMPASS (primary purpose) and SQ 5-8 address the effectiveness and implementability of the B-COMPASS (secondary purpose). The SQs are:\n\nSQ 1 How accurately does the B-COMPASS predict the relative adherence to treatment for patients? SQ 2 How valid are the B-COMPASS groupings? SQ 3 How accurately are the patient support needs identified by the B-COMPASS? SQ 4 How reliable is the B-COMPASS over time? SQ 5 To what extent does the use of the B-COMPASS affect patient adherence to treatment? SQ 6 How do the patients perceive the received engagement with HCPs/Research Leads based on the B-COMPASS? SQ 7 How do HCPs/Research Leads perceive the B-COMPASS? SQ 8 How does the B-COMPASS impact the cost-effectiveness of healthcare utilisation?",

    "detailed_description": "According to the WHO classification of 2010, Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) are graded according to the Ki67 proliferation index and grouped into neuroendocrine Tumors (NET) Grade 1 (NET G1, Ki67 \\<3%), NET G2 (Ki67 3-20%), and neuroendocrine Carcinomas (NEC) (G3, Ki67 \\>20%). However, since the WHO 2017/2019 classification the group of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors with a Ki67 \u226520% (NEN G3) is subdivided according to their morphology into highly proliferative differentiated NET G3 and poorly differentiated high grade neuroendocrine Carcinomas (NEC G3, Ki67 \\> 20%), which - depending on their morphology - are subdivided into small cell as well as large cell NECs. The vast majority (60-90%) of patients with high grade NEC are metastasized at the time of diagnosis with distant metastases present in approximately two third of the patients.\n\nThe prognosis of patients with metastatic NEN G3 is poor, and median overall survival has been reported to be 5 months with a 2-year survival rate of 11 % in the SEER data base for gastrointestinal NEC. In two large series of GEP-NEC, median survival was 12-19 months for patients with best available therapy (mainly platinum based chemotherapy) and as short as 1 month for those receiving only best supportive therapy. In contrast to the \"classical\" undifferentiated NEC G3 with a poorly differentiated morphology and a Ki 67 \\> 55%, NET G3 typically do not respond as well to a platinum based chemotherapy but a have a somewhat better prognosis with a 4-months longer median survival as compared to classical NEC G3. Therefore, according to current guidelines other treatment options like temozolomide based chemotherapy may be considered as a first line therapy in patients with differentiated \"NET G3\".\n\nThere is a strong and unmet medical need for a novel and effective second line treatment option for these highly aggressive and rapidly progressing tumors.\n\nConsidering the lack of any other established therapeutic option and the very limited efficacy of alternative second or third line chemotherapy in patients with NEN G3 who are progressive after a first-line chemotherapy, the availability of a novel therapeutic option with a significant clinical benefit (SD; PR; CR) in at least 40 % of the patients and with tolerable side effects would represent an important and clinical highly relevant break through in the treatment of these aggressive tumors.\n\nAvelumab is a fully human antibody that binds PD-L1 and blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1. This removes the suppressive effect of PD-L1 on anti-tumor CD8+ T cells, resulting in restoration of cytotoxic T cell response.\n\nIn the ongoing phase II trial of the investigator (AveNEC, EudraCT No: 2016-004373-40), which is the largest immunotherapy trial in patients with NEN G3, the clinical activity and safety of the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab is evaluated in 60 patients with advanced, metastatic NEN G3 progressive after chemotherapy. According to the interim analysis presented at ASCO 2019 a clinically meaningful response was seen in 27 % of patients with a significant longer progression free survival (mean PFS 33.5 vs 7.7 weeks) and overall survival (\\> 60 weeks mean not reached vs 22.4 weeks) as compared to the non-responders.\n\nCabozantinib is a multikinase inhibitor of MET, VEGFR, AXL and RET which is currently being used very successfully in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), which is a differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasia, in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n\nIn addition to its TKI activity, there is strong evidence that Cabozantinib modulates the tumor immune microenvironment leading to a synergistic efficacy in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor therapy.\n\nThere is an especially strong rationale for a combination therapy of the potent antiangiogenic TKI Cabozantinib with the checkpoint inhibitor Avelumab in NEN G3. Both drugs have demonstrated efficacy and safety in combination therapy studies of a checkpoint inhibitor and an antiangiogenic TKI in a variety of tumors and both drugs in monotherapy have shown clinical relevant antitumor efficacy in NEN.",

    "brief_summary": "CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine treatment is the standard of care in advanced breast cancer (ABC) with expression of hormone receptors and without HER2 overexpression (ER+/HER2-). When patients experience disease progression under this strategy, options of second-line endocrine treatment in combination with other targeted therapies are limited and have failed to improve overall survival to date over endocrine treatment alone. A significant fraction of ER+/HER2- ABC display genetic alterations associated with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) which may be associated with efficacy of therapeutic targeting DNA damage response (DDR) pathways. Moreover, other molecular alterations associated with replicative stress may be found in ER+/HER2- ABC patients which may also favor antitumor activity of DDR targeting therapeutics. M1774 is a novel orally administered inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related (ATR), a protein kinase with key activity in DDR pathway. MATRIx is a phase I/II study aiming to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D, phase I) as well as efficacy and safety (phase II) of M1774 in combination with fulvestrant in ER+/HER2-ABC patients whose disease has become resistant to aromatase inhibitor plus CDK4/6 inhibitor, and whose tumor displays molecular alterations associated with HRD, oncogenic driver activation and/or replicative stress. Primary endpoints will include: maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of M1774 in combination with fulvestrant (phase I), the clinical benefit rate and toxicity of the combination at RP2D of M1774 in the molecularly selected population (phase II). Baseline, on-treatment and post-treatment blood and tumor tissue samples will be collected for pharmacokinetics and translational analyses including genomic characterization of tumor tissue and ctDNA as well as functional studies focusing on DDR pathways.",
    "detailed_description": "Approximately 5% among all types of breast cancers are associated with germline breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA 1 or 2 mutations (gBRCA). These mutations lead to homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and inability for cancer cells to repair DNA double-strand break (DDSB), making gBRCA-ABC exquisitely sensitive to poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (22). Indeed, PARP is a pivotal actor in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks (DSSB), and PARP inhibition will generate accumulating DSSB leading to DDSB and ultimately cell death if let unrepaired, as it is in the context of HRD. In OlympiAD and EMBRACA trials assessing the efficacy of olaparib or talazoparib, respectively compared to physician's choice single-agent, non platin-based, chemotherapy in gBRCA HER2- ABC patients, a significant increase in PFS and an improvement in QOL was shown with both PARP inhibitors (23, 24) . Of note, around 50% of the patients in these trials had ER+/HER2- breast cancer. Among these patients the PFS was 7 month and 8.6 month with olaparib and talazoparib respectively. Yet, either in this subgroup or in the overall population, there was no OS improvement (25, 26). Nevertheless, according to guidelines (3), PARP inhibitors should be part of the treatment sequence in gBRCA, ER+ /HER2- ABC patients when the disease becomes resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitor-based first-line ET.\n\nEven in the absence of gBRCA, HRD may still exist in tumors due to somatic defects in BRCA genes as well as alterations in other genes involved in homologous recombination repair such as ATM, BARD1, CHEK1, CHEK2, RAD51C, RAD51D, BRIP1, NBN, PALB2, and the Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) family of genes (FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, and FANCL): the so-called \"BRCAness\" phenotype (27). In whole-exome studies focusing on ABC samples, we and others found that more than approximately 15% of ER+/HER2- ABC may display such a BRCAness phenotype (28-30). Although it should be theoretically associated with similar sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, clinical data examining anti-tumor activity of this latter class remain relatively sparse. In a recent study investigating antitumor activity of olaparib in ABC with either germline mutations in HR-related genes other than BRCA1/2 or somatic BRCA1/2 mutations, only patients with gPALB2 or somatic BRCA mutations but not those with mutations in other homologous recombination-associated genes had high response rates and clinical benefit (31). Thus, developing alternative therapeutic targeting DNA damage response (DDR) pathways in BRCA and non BRCA-driven HRD is urgently needed.\n\nDNA damage repair pathway :\n\nThe DDR pathway, which coordinates the detection of cellular DNA damage with cell-cycle adaptation and repair processes, primarily involves ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related (ATR), ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK/PRKDC). ATR, the key DDR kinase, is activated by accumulated DSSB, primarily induced by oncogene-driven dysregulated replication, leading to the so-called replication stress (RS) and associated genomic instability. Once activated, ATR phosphorylates checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), leading to cell-cycle arrest, pausing of DNA synthesis and initiation of DNA repair. Loss of ATR function leads to the inability to resolve stalled replication forks, the accumulation of DNA damage and rapid cell death (32, 33).While normal cells can generally tolerate inhibition of ATR by activating compensatory DNA repair pathways, such pathways are frequently defective in cancer cells, rendering them highly dependent on ATR for survival. Due to its major implication in RS-induced DDR pathway activation, ATR has been recently considered as a potential target in various cancer models and several ATR inhibitors are under clinical evaluation. Classically, tumors with high level of RS have been suggested to be the most sensitive to ATR inhibitors, including RS-induced by oncogenic amplification such as MYC, RAS or Cyclin E1. Other potential molecular alterations that may sensitize to ATR inhibitors are those associated with HRD (33, 34) as well as those associated with DDR such as loss of expression of ATM, ARID1A, ERCC4, XRCC1, RB133, (35-39). Of note, recent works have revealed that treatment with ATR inhibitors can overcome the resistance to PARP inhibition (40), suggesting the potential of ATR inhibitors as a second-line treatment in patients who have developed resistance to PARP inhibitors (33).\n\nATR inhibitors and M1774:\n\nFirst early-phase studies have been initiated using ATR inhibitors as monotherapy or in combination with various therapeutics including chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors in various tumor types. Tolerance was favorable and preliminary proofs of activity have been obtained, notably in patients with DDR and/or HR pathway alterations (41-43). M1774 (substance code MSC2584415A; also known as VXc-400 or VRT-1363004) is an orally administered small molecule inhibitor of ATR kinase; it is a potent and selective inhibitor of ATR, with a mean half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 4 nM, as measured by inhibition of the phosphorylation of the proximal target CHK1 in cells (M1774's IB V2.0, Nov 2020). Pre-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic (PK), and toxicology studies support development of M1774 for the treatment of patients with advanced cancers and a phase I study is currently ongoing.\n\nAs of 21 APR 2022, 55 participants received doses of M1774 ranging from 5 mg to 270 mg once daily (QD). Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were observed at dose levels of 130 mg QD and above. DLT included grade 2 and 3 anemia requiring transfusion in 7 patients, as well as one grade 4 thrombopenia associated with upper gastro-intestinal hemorrhage. Most frequent toxicities also included gastro-intestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea and abdominal pain). The recommended phase 2 dose as monotherapy was 180 mg QD, 2 weeks on/ 1 week off. Of note, preliminary data showed that PK was approximately dose proportional up to 180 mg and slightly more than dose proportional beyond 180 mg. Absorption was fast with median Tmax ranging from 1 to 3.5 hours and mean T1/2 ranged from 3 to 5.6 hours.",

    "brief_summary": "This clinical study is looking at the combination of two experimental drugs called tepotinib and pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab, also known as Keytruda, is licenced and available by prescription to treat a variety of cancers. Tepotinib is currently licensed in the UK for use in non-small cell lung cancer (NCSLC) and is being investigated for this purpose.\n\nCancer immunotherapy drugs hold great promise but still do not work for many patients. Laboratory studies on cancers that do not respond well to immunotherapy reveal that most of these tumours do not have any immune cells. This suggests that the cancer has successfully hidden itself and avoided being recognised by the immune system. This study aims to use a novel approach using a targeted drug, tepotinib, to target the gene involved with NSCLC.\n\nTepotinib is a type of drug called a kinase inhibitor. Kinase inhibitors are a newer type of drug being used to try to treat cancers. They act by blocking some of the chemical messengers that are part of the signalling process within cancer cells that control their growth. Tepotinib is used in adults to treat NSCLC that can have certain abnormal changes in the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor gene (MET) and which has spread and/or cannot be removed by surgery. The changes in the MET gene can make an abnormal protein which can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer. By blocking this abnormal protein, tepotinib may slow or stop the cancer from growing as well as potentially shrinking the cancer. This study will include patients with and without the MET exon 14 mutations.\n\nIn this clinical study, the investigators aim to test our ideas in a small number of people for the first time, specifically in those patients with cancers which do not respond to cancer immunotherapy.",
