    "brief_summary": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality after renal transplantation, accounting for more than 30% of deaths. Elevated lipid levels (hyperlipidemia) are a frequent finding following transplantation and the immunosuppressive medications play a central role in the development or worsening of hyperlipidemia. In the general population, the correlation between elevated serum cholesterol and increased risk of cardiovascular disease is well established and the reduction in serum LDL cholesterol has proved to significantly reduce both morbidity and mortality.\n\nStatin based drugs are the standard of care in the management of hyperlipidemia. Commonly used statin-based drugs include atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol, Lescol XL), lovastatin (Mevacor, Altoprev), pravastatin (Pravachol), rosuvastatin (Crestor), simvastatin (Zocor), and pitavastatin (Livalo). These drugs have been proven to lower lipid levels as well as cardiovascular risk. However, statin-based drugs also cause a variety of side effects. While the most commonly encountered side effects are toxicity to the liver and muscles, a few others have also been known to cause increased excretion of protein in the urine and kidney failure. These side effects are also more common in a renal transplant recipient due to the simultaneous administration of drugs that prevent rejection. Therefore, there is an emergent need for newer drugs which are both efficient and safe especially in this population PCSK-9 inhibitors (Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kinase-9 inhibitors) are a new class of drugs that are highly efficient in lowering lipid levels in the general population. However, an exclusive trial involving kidney transplant recipients is yet to be done. Through this study, we would like to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Evolocumab (trade name: Repatha) which is a PCSK-9 inhibitor developed by Amgen, Inc in renal transplant recipients. The study would involve a total of 120 patients across 3 different hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts.",
    "detailed_description": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in renal transplant recipients (RTR). 44% of RTR have LDL-C greater than 100mg/dL, six months after transplant. The correlation between the increase in serum LDL level and the increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is well established. A reduction in LDL level is associated with a decreased risk of mortality and morbidity in patients with ASCVD. Statins have been the long-standing drug of choice in treating dyslipidemia. A single prospective randomized trial known as the ALERT trial compared the benefits of statins to placebo in transplant recipients. The original study consisted of 2000 RTR and an extension of this study evaluated 1652 patients and demonstrated a 21% reduction in major cardiac events (p=0.036) and a 29% reduction in cardiac death or definite non-fatal myocardial infarction (p=0.014). Even though statins decrease the probability of cardiovascular events there was no difference in graft survival or mortality benefit in RTR. Another concerning factor for the use of statins is the tolerability of these drugs. Statins have been associated with hepatotoxicity and myotoxicity, the incidence of which is higher in RTR. This effect is dose-related and may be precipitated by the administration of agents that inhibit cytochrome p450 isoenzymes such as Tacrolimus and Cyclosporine which are the most commonly used immunosuppressants. Another statin based drug (Fluvastatin) has been associated with proteinuria and renal failure. Hence there is a need to explore novel treatment options in the management of dyslipidemia, particularly in RTR. PCSK-9 inhibitors (Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kinase-9 inhibitors) have shown to decrease LDL levels by 60% in patients on statin therapy. However, these drugs have been studied sparingly in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and have not yet been analyzed in RTR.\n\nThe study will involve 120 patients across 3 different hospitals. Two different but equivalent drug dosing strategies are available. A 420mg monthly subcutaneous injection using an on-body infusor (Repatha Pushtronex system) or a 140mg subcutaneous injection once every two weeks using a prefilled auto-injector (Repatha SureClick). The choice of dosing strategy will be based on patient preference. This study will be conducted over one year.",

It would also provide a rationale to explore other indications for IFN-\u03b3 in the context of an alloSCT, including 1) IFN-\u03b3/DLI for relapsed disease after haploidentical alloSCT; 2) pre-emptive post-alloSCT treatment of patients transplanted with measurable residual disease (MRD) or with poor-risk AML/MDS such as with TP53 mutations; and 3) prevention of relapse in patients who can only tolerate reduced-intensity conditioning regimens which in most studies results in higher rates of post-alloSCT AML/MDS relapse than when intensive conditioning regimens are employed. Together, this work would allow more patients with AML/MDS to be referred for and ultimately benefit from an alloSCT.",

Thus, innovative approaches are needed which combine excellent activity and tolerability in WM. Chemotherapy-free approaches are highly attractive for this patient group. Based on its high activity in WM and its low toxicity, Ibrutinib was approved for the treatment of WM by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). However, also Ibrutinib fails to induce CRs and the VGPR rate is 16% in relapsed patients. In addition, activity of Ibrutinib depends on the genotype: compared to MYD88mut/CXCR4WT patients Ibrutinib single agent therapy induces substantially lower response rates in patients with the MYD88mut/CXCR4mut or the MYD88WT/CXCR4WT genotype (major response (at least PR) in 91.7 % compared to 61.9 and 0 %, respectively). Phase II data have indicated that the proteasome inhibitor Carfilzomib is able to overcome the inferior prognosis of Ibrutinib in MYD88mut/CXCR4mut and MYD88WT/CXCR4WT patients, as response rates were high for all genotypes in a phase II study combining Carfilzomib with Rituximab and Dexamethasone. Based on this the investigators hypothesize that addition of Carfilzomib to Ibrutinib will increase the VGPR/CR rate compared to Ibrutinib alone in patients with WM, in particular in patients carrying the CXCR4 mutation. In addition, the investigators hypothesize, that the combination Carfilzomib and Ibrutinib will be also highly active in MYD88 wildtype patients and that this combination will be at least as efficient in treatment na\u00efve patients as in relapsed/refractory patients.",

Thus, innovative approaches are needed which combine excellent activity and tolerability in patients with WM, who are mostly of advanced age. Today, chemotherapy in combination with the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab is still the backbone of treatment in patients with WM and is recommended as first line in national and international treatment guidelines.With the approval of Ibrutinib by the EMA 2015 for patients with relapsed WM or for patients not eligible for chemotherapy with treatment na\u00efve WM treatment landscape has changed in this lymphoma subtype and there is an urgent need to evaluate to which extent chemotherapy-free approaches add clinical benefit to the patient.

    "detailed_description": "Romosozumab is an anti-sclerostin antibody that provides powerful skeletal benefits through concomitant osteoanabolic and antiresorptive effects on bone. In postmenopausal women, romosozumab is associated with larger increases in spine and hip BMD in comparison to teriparatide. Romosozumab has an extremely low reported nonresponse rate and transition to denosumab after romosozumab leads to further BMD increases and sustained anti-fracture efficacy.\n\nTherefore, the investigators hypothesize that romosozumab will be associated with improvements in bone mass in premenopausal women, and also that the responses and response rates will exceed those observed in premenopausal women treated with teriparatide. The investigators will test this hypothesis in this phase 2 study of 30 premenopausal women with IOP who will receive 12M of romosozumab 210 mg monthly followed by 12M of denosumab 60 mg SC q6M (\"romosozumab-denosumab\").\n\nAim 1 will define the within-group effect of romosozumab-denosumab. The primary outcome variable will be the within-group change in areal BMD by DXA at the lumbar spine at 12M. Secondary outcome variables include change in aBMD by DXA at the total hip, femoral neck and 1/3 radius at 12M and change in aBMD at all sites at 24 months.\n\nAim 2 will compare results from participants treated with romosozumab-denosumab to the well-characterized historical controls treated with 24 months of teriparatide alone, and a subset of those treated with 24 months of teriparatide followed by 12 months of denosumab. The investigators hypothesize that romosozumab over 12M and romosozumab-denosumab over 24M will be associated with larger BMD gains compared to 12M and 24M of teriparatide. The investigators also hypothesize that 24M of romosozumab-denosumab will be associated with comparable BMD gains vs. historical controls treated with 36M of teriparatide-denosumab.",

    "brief_summary": "Ivabradine (IVA) has been shown to decrease the risk of hospitalizations for worsening Heart Failure and was associated with a trend towards improved mortality in the SHIFT1 trial. SHIFT1 excluded patients within 4 weeks of hospital discharge, so the efficacy and safety of IVA in this setting is less clear.\n\nIn today's health care environment more and more patients that present to the Emergency Department (ED) for mild Acute Heart Failure (AHF) are being placed into observation unit and subsequently discharged, or discharged outright from the ED. This is not only a growing segment of patients, but also represents an important window of opportunity to intervene with a potentially effective therapy.\n\nMoreover, at this point in a patient's experience (being discharged after getting treated for exacerbation of Heart Failure), it's not clear that beta blockers (BB) should yet be increased/started due to the recent state of exacerbation.\n\nStandard treatment of worsened heart failure presenting to the ED or urgent care includes diuretics (e. g. furosemide) and vasodilators (e.g. ACE-I, ARB, Hydralazine/Isosorbide or ARNi), but according to usual standard of care, titration of beta blockade is often reserved for outpatient follow up after a period of demonstrated stability (in the ambulatory setting).\n\nThis is in contradistinction to hospitalized patients, where patients have been observed by the treating team for days, presumably show stability and improvement, and starting low dose BB at the time of hospital discharge has been shown to be safe. As such these ED/Observation discharge patients are often not optimal candidates for intensification of BB at the time of release, and could be considered to be at maximally tolerated BB dose (for at least for 2-4 weeks). This may represent a vulnerable period for these patients; its unknown in the setting of Observation discharge but evidence from hospitalized patients indicates that the highest daily risk of rehospitalization is in the days just after discharge. IVA may be effective post observation unit management (where lower risk Heart Failure (HF) patients are typically placed), to reduce heart rate (without decreasing contractility, such as a BB would) to help reduce the risk of hospitalization or emergency care, but safety and efficacy (in terms of heart rate lowering) in this setting has not been previously explored.\n\nAdditionally, the SHIFT1 trial lacked African Americans and this unique patient population has not been previously studied with IVA. The investigating sites serve a predominantly African American patient population. Therefore the proposed study represents an important opportunity to gather data on IVA effect in this understudied group of patients.",
    "detailed_description": "Subjects will be enrolled at the time of discharge from the observation unit (visit 1), all baseline procedures will be performed at this time, these would include blood draw for biomarker assessments, vitals, physical examination, and IP dispensation. At the baseline visit, the study team will schedule a follow-up appointment post Day 28 +/- 2 (Visit 3) with the subject's primary care physician(PCP)/cardiologist, if the subject does not have their own PCP/cardiologist the study team will schedule and facilitate this appointment with the Gateway Clinic. A list of current medications and doses will be provided. At Day 14 +/-1 (visit 2) the subject will return for a follow up visit for IP accountability and titration (if needed), BB uptitration (if needed), replacement of the HR monitor (Zio patch), assessment of any adverse events, ECG, vital signs, and will undergo a physical examination. At Day 28 +/-2 (visit 3), the patient will return for study exit procedures, which include blood draw for biomarker assessments, vitals, physical examination, assessment of adverse events (if any), and IP return.\n\nAs with any clinical trial, no un-blinding will occur unless there is a concern for patient safety, as this could affect the integrity of data. The study team will provide the patient and patient's PCP/cardiologist a clinical summary, inclusive of ECGs. On-going management for the patient's condition will be at the discretion of their PCP/cardiologist and will not be influenced directly by participation in this study.\n\nAt Randomization the initial Ivabradine dose will be 5 mg BID. At Day 14 follow up, medication adjustments will be made (if needed). At Day 28 follow up, IP will be permanently stopped.\n\nAt the last visit, the study team will contact the patient's primary care physician and/or the cardiologist to notify that the patient has completed the study and is off study drug and it is now the PCP/cardiologist's discretion to prescribe open label ivabradine (Corlanor) to the patient or not, as clinically indicated. If the patient's primary care physician and/or cardiologist prescribes open label ivabradine (Corlanor) after the completion of the study, the patient or patient's insurance will be responsible for payment as this would then be part of routine clinical care.\n\nThe Zio patch will be placed at discharge from the observation unit. At the 14-day follow-up the original Zio patch will be collected and a second one will be placed. At the 28-day follow-up the second Zio patch will be collected\n\nBased on the SHIFT1 study, the mean heart rate reduction with IVA is 8 bpm with a standard deviation of 13 bpm. A sample size of 57 in each group will have 90% power to detect a difference in means of 8.0 assuming that the common standard deviation is 13.0 using a two group t-test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. To account for a projected dropout rate of 15%, 66 subjects will be enrolled in each group (132 total for the study over a 2-year period). Furthermore, the investigators expect that the enrollment centers will recruit a cohort that is 75% self-identified African Americans. This number (n=99) will provide 80% power to detect the same effect size when analyzed in African Americans only.\n\nFor the safety endpoint (unplanned presentation for medical care), assuming an event rate of 25% at 1 month (estimated based on local hospital readmission rates), the sample size will provide 80% power to detect a doubling of the relative risk. If the Control group event rate is higher there will be greater power; for example, with an event rate of 35% we would have 98% power for risk ratio of 2.0 and 83% power for risk ratio of 1.75.",

    "detailed_description": "SHPT is a common and serious co-morbidity that develops relatively early in the course of CKD, worsens with declining kidney function, and is associated with serious complications in children on dialysis. Children on dialysis experience a wide spectrum of bone abnormalities and growth retardation, in addition to increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that manifests early in their adulthood. Traditional therapies for SHPT (eg, vitamin D sterols) are widely used in the pediatric dialysis population, and have the potential to aggravate complications of the disease by increasing serum calcium (Ca), serum phosphorus, and serum Ca times serum phosphorus product.\n\nEtelcalcetide has been shown to be safe and efficacious in treating adult CKD patients with SHPT by simultaneously controlling intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), Ca, and phosphorus and has recently been approved for use in adult patients with SHPT treated with hemodialysis in both the United States and Europe. Although no previous studies have been conducted in pediatric patients with etelcalcetide (one single dose pharmacokinetic \\[PK\\] study is currently ongoing),Amgen anticipates minimal to moderate risk with a possibility of direct benefit to the pediatric subjects (age 28 days to 18 years) in this study. The burden of complications of SHPT in the pediatric dialysis population and the limitations of current standard therapy, underscore the need for studies of etelcalcetide in these patients to address this unmet medical need and inform the pediatric nephrology community of the potential use of etelcalcetide in children on hemodialysis with critical safety and efficacy data.",

All individuals will need \u2265 12 months of previous denosumab treatment (minimum of 2 doses) prior to switching to assigned randomization arm. The minimum number of doses (n = 2) is based on published data that the rebound in BMD might be less pronounced in patients receiving very limited denosumab. According to a systematic review of patients with multiple vertebral fractures following denosumab cessation, those with \u22642 years of denosumab treatment had fewer fractures compared with those with \\>2 years. Therefore, the maximum number of prior doses (n = 4) is based on higher incidence of rebound loss of bone mineral density (BMD), more rapid turnover, and potentially greater vertebral fractures after discontinuation of denosumab in patients who received more extensive treatment. Investigators will limit the trial to a more restricted use of denosumab duration (2-4 doses) to maintain greater homogeneity, given the somewhat smaller planned sample size. Users of denosumab will be sorted into two groups:\n\n* Prevalent users: Defined as individuals with a minimum of one previous dose of denosumab, and up to 4 previous doses of denosumab (maximum). Prevalent users with one previous dose will receive a second dose of denosumab before proceeding to assigned randomization arm. Therefore, randomization will occur 2 weeks after screening visit if they had already 2-4 denosumab doses.\n* New denosumab users: Defined as individuals who have not previously received denosumab.

    "detailed_description": "This research study is designed to provide a better understanding of study drugs cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) and palbociclib when used in combination to treat patients with metastatic colon cancer.\n\nCetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) is an antibody designed to target a protein called Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). EGFR plays an important role in the growth and survival of colon cancer. Antibodies are proteins that are naturally produced by the immune system and circulate throughout your body to help protect you from disease caused by bacteria, viruses, cancer cells or any foreign or toxic substance. Antibodies work by sticking to and flagging or marking foreign cells or substances so that your body's immune defense system will recognize, attack and remove them. Antibodies help the body rid itself of disease. Antibodies can also be designed in the laboratory to stick to specific parts of cancer cells (or normal cells) to change or block the ways those cells function in your body and to produce a therapeutic anti-cancer effect. Cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) is an antibody drug approved by the FDA and is commonly used to treat your type of colon cancer.\n\nPalbociclib is an FDA-approved drug for patients with breast cancer. Palbociclib is not FDA-approved for the treatment of colon cancer, and is considered an investigational drug in this research study. Palbociclib targets a protein called CDK4/6 that is a critical part of the cell division and cell growth processes known as \"the cell cycle\". Laboratory studies have shown that palbociclib inhibits the cell cycle, slows or stops cell growth, and can cause cell death in cancer cells.\n\nThe combination of Cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) with palbociclib is not approved by the FDA for treating colon cancer and is considered investigational in this research study.\n\nYou are being asked to be in the study because your colon cancer has been found to contain the proteins KRAS, NRAS and BRAF that are normal (wild-type). These proteins play an important role in the growth and survival of colon cancer. This requirement is important because colon cancer with these characteristics has been shown to be more responsive to EGFR inhibitors such as cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae), one of the drugs used in this study that is also a standard treatment option for your type of cancer. Also, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) has been shown to stimulate cancer cell division, growth and survival by working together with KRAS, NRAS and BRAF to activate CDK4/6 and to support an accelerated cell cycle. This accelerated cell cycle allows the cancer cells to divide and grow faster than your normal cells but also can make them sensitive to the effects of CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, a cell-cycle inhibitor.\n\nTo participate in this study you also must meet one of the following requirements:\n\nA. You have not been treated with EGFR inhibitors such as cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) or panitumumab (Vectibix\u00ae).\n\nB. You were treated with anti-EGFR drugs such as cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) or panitumumab (Vectibix\u00ae) and experienced at least 4 months of response to treatment, and it has been at least 8-weeks since you were last treated with an anti-EGFR drug.\n\nThis will allow investigators to compare the anti-cancer effects of cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) combined with palbociclib in 2 different groups of cancer patients:\n\n1. Patients that have never received EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) or panitumumab (Vectibix\u00ae). This group will test whether resistance to the combination of cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) plus palbociclib develops in this type of cancer.\n2. Patients that have previously shown an anti-cancer response to EGFR inhibitors, such as cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) or panitumumab (Vectibix\u00ae), of four or more months, but then developed resistance. This group will test whether the combination of cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) plus palbociclib is more effective against this resistant type of cancer.\n\nFurthermore, laboratory studies have shown that the combination of EGFR and CDK inhibitors provide a stronger anti-cancer effect when used in combination than seen when each inhibitor is used alone. Thus, the reason researchers are using cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae) and palbociclib in combination is to simultaneously target and inhibit multiple processes inside of the cancer cell that are critical to growth and survival of the tumor. With this combination strategy, researchers hope to improve upon existing anti-cancer therapies.",

    "detailed_description": "This study utilizes a single arm phase II design. Treatment will consist of 3 main phases: Induction, early post induction \\[including Consolidation, Blinatumomab 1, High-Dose Methotrexate, Reinduction, Interim, Reconsolidation, and Blinatumomab 2\\], and Maintenance.\n\nInduction:\n\n* Induction includes 7 days of therapy on the INITIALL classification protocol (NCT06289673) as well as 5 further weeks of treatment on this trial. Treatment includes 15 days of oral (PO) or intravenous (IV) dexamethasone, 3 weekly doses of vincristine IV, and 2 doses of inotuzumab IV on Days 2 and 8. Patients will then receive blinatumomab IV from Days 9-36. Dasatinib PO will be added beginning on Day 12 for patients with an ABL-class fusion including patients with Ph+ ALL. These patients will also receive dasatinib in all subsequent cycles of therapy. Intrathecal (IT) MHA will be given. Patients will have a week without chemotherapy at the end of Induction, although patients with Induction failure (MRD \u22655% disease) will proceed directly to consolidation.\n\nEarly Post Induction:\n\n* Consolidation will be given following completion of Remission Induction Therapy. Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenous (IV), cytarabine IV, inotuzumab IV, and dasatinib PO for patients with ABL-class fusion. Patients will have a week without chemotherapy at the end of Consolidation.\n* Blinatumomab 1 will be given for four weeks to all patients after recovery from Consolidation.\n* High-dose Methotrexate will be given IV every two weeks for four cycles. Patients will also receive an intrathecal chemotherapy treatment with each of the 2 week cycles and will take oral mercaptopurine continuously if tolerated.\n* Reinduction will consist of dexamethasone for 7 days in the first and third week, 3 weekly doses of vincristine IV, 1 dose of daunorubicin IV, 1 dose of calaspargase IV, intrathecal (IT) MHA one dose, and dasatinib PO daily (for patients with ABL-class fusion).\n* Interim includes mercaptopurine po daily for 6 weeks, dexamethasone for 1 week (5 days), daunorubicin and vincristine IV on day 1 of weeks 2 and 5, calaspargase IV on day 1 of weeks 1 and 4, IT MHA on day 1 of week 4 and dasatinib po daily for 6 weeks (for patients with ABL-class fusion). Patients will have a week without chemotherapy at the end of Interim Therapy. Patients with Down syndrome will not receive daunorubicin during this phase.\n* Reconsolidation will repeat therapy given in Consolidation but replace the investigational inotuzumab with traditional mercaptopurine.\n* Blinatumomab 2 will be given for four weeks to patients with elevated end of induction MRD and patients with Down syndrome after Reconsolidation.\n\nMaintenance therapy follows Reconsolidation or Blinatumomab 2 (for those patients receiving this therapy) and includes 8 pulses of dexamethasone and vincristine given every 4 weeks, weekly methotrexate, daily mercaptopurine, intrathecal therapy, and dasatinib (for patients with ABL-class fusions). Maintenance therapy lasts a total of 80 weeks.\n\nDuration of therapy is approximately 2\u00bc years.

    "detailed_description": "PRE-PHASE: Patients may receive corticosteroids and/or hydroxyurea at the discretion of the treating physician prior to beginning induction therapy. A seven-day corticosteroid pre-phase, which can include days of corticosteroid receipt prior to protocol registration, will precede initiation of TKI therapy on day 1. Corticosteroid dose and schedule are at the discretion of the investigator during the pre-phase, with dosing caps of prednisone 120 mg/day, dexamethasone 24 mg/day, or biologic equivalents thereof. In the event the treating investigator feels delaying induction therapy (TKI + dexamethasone) would be unsafe (e.g. ALL progressing despite corticosteroids), the patient may proceed to day 1 (begin TKI + dexamethasone) before completion of 7-day pre-phase if investigator feels delay would be unsafe.\n\nINDUCTION THERAPY: Induction therapy consists of dexamethasone in combination with TKI. TKI therapy will generally begin with dasatinib 140 mg daily (dose changes or transition to alternative TKI permitted subject to the provisions in the protocol). Patients will receive dexamethasone 10 mg/m2/day (up to 24 mg /day) in single or divided doses, days 1-24. Dexamethasone will be tapered days 25-32 (\u00b13 days for start and end of taper); the TKI will be continued during and following the dexamethasone taper. Recommended CNS prophylaxis consists of intrathecal (IT) or intra-Ommaya (IO) methotrexate 12 mg day 22 and day 43 (\u00b17 days); of note, methotrexate 12 mg is recommended though agent/dosing left to discretion of investigator. Hydrocortisone IT may be given along with methotrexate at the discretion of the investigator. Bone marrow evaluations will be performed on days 22 (\u00b13 days) and day 43 (\u00b13 days) and will include minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment by BCR-ABL1 transcript studies and flow cytometry. Under certain circumstances, the induction period may be extended for up to 21 days with bone marrow studies repeated at that time.\n\nCONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients in complete response (CR) or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) following remission induction, with or without MRD, proceed to consolidation therapy, defined as day 1 of cycle 1 of blinatumomab, within 21 days of day 43 or the date of BMA establishing CR/CRi, whichever is later. TKI will be administered continuously. Patients will begin Blinatumomab 28 mcg/daily IVCI for patients \u226545 kg; patients \\<45 kg will be treated at a dose of 15 mcg/m2/day, capped at a dose of 28 mcg/day, given for a 28-day cycle, with dose adjustments further subject to the provisions outlined in the protocol. Inpatient admission is recommended for at least days 1-3 of cycle 1 of blinatumomab (\u226572 hours from start of infusion). Following each 28-day infusion of blinatumomab, a mandatory period of 14 days off blinatumomab will follow during which bone marrow evaluation will be performed with MRD assessment and CNS prophylaxis will be administered. The consolidation period will consist of 3 cycles of blinatumomab given as such. Patients may come off therapy at any point to undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT).\n\nMAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients in complete molecular response (as defined within the protocol) following blinatumomab cycle 3 and not proceeding immediately to alloHCT may proceed to maintenance therapy, defined as day 1 of cycle 4 of blinatumomab, within 28 days of completion of blinatumomab infusion in cycle 3. TKI will be administered continuously. Blinatumomab will be given for up to 4 additional 28-day cycles (cycles 4-7) with a mandatory period of 28 days (\u00b17 days) off blinatumomab between cycles, during which CNS prophylaxis will be administered. Bone marrow evaluation with MRD assessment will be performed after cycles 5 and 7 of blinatumomab.\n\nFOLLOW-UP: TKI maintenance is recommended but not required. Further post-remission therapy, if any, at the discretion of the treating physician. Following completion of all required study treatments and assessments, patients enrolled will be followed for long-term survival and relapse outcomes as outlined in the protocol.",

    "detailed_description": "This is a Phase I/II study of blinatumomab in combination with pembrolizumab in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-lineage ALL (B-ALL). The primary objective of this study is to determine if the addition of pembrolizumab to blinatumomab improves the Complete Response Rate (CR) and Complete Remission with Partial Hematologic Recovery (CRh) relative to blinatumomab alone in adult subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with high bone marrow lymphoblast percentage (\\>50% lymphoblasts).\n\nMechanisms of resistance to blinatumomab are not well understood although inhibition of or suboptimal T-cell activation may play an important role. Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and Programmed Death-Ligand 2 (PD-L2) expression and upregulation in lymphoblasts and the bone marrow microenvironment at baseline and in response to cytokines including those released upon blinatumomab exposure may inhibit T-cell function through the Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) receptor and lead to resistance to blinatumomab. The investigators hypothesize that part of the resistance to therapy with blinatumomab is mediated by the exuberant cytokine release seen with higher disease burden leading to increased expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2. Enhancing T-cell activity through use of the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab is predicted to augment the activity of blinatumomab and convert more patients to complete remission and prolong remission durations. This study will also act to expand knowledge of PD-L1 and PD-L2 dynamics in response to blinatumomab. It will also be a paradigm for the addition of checkpoint inhibitors to therapy with bifunctional T-cell engaging antibodies currently in development for targeting other liquid and solid tumors.\n\nThe PD-1 receptor-ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune control. This suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4/kappa) isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.\n\nThe study will be conducted in 2 stages:\n\nStage 1 is to ensure safety of pembrolizumab in combination with blinatumomab.\n\nStage 2 of the study will include an expansion cohort of up to 21 additional subjects (for a total of 24 subjects) to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of blinatumomab and pembrolizumab in adults with relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL",

    "brief_summary": "The Cardamon trial is a phase 2 trial using the standard chemotherapy drugs cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone in combination with a new drug called Carfilzomib in patients with multiple myeloma.",
    "detailed_description": "Multiple Myeloma is a cancer of the bone marrow and, for those patients that are young and fit enough, the disease is usually treated with chemotherapy (sometimes called induction chemotherapy) followed by a stem cell transplant using the patient's own stem cells (autograft or Autologous Stem Cell Transplant). Unfortunately almost all patients will experience a relapse at some point following this treatment. After relapse there are a number of treatment options but eventually the disease will become resistant to further therapy.\n\nThe use of an Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (or Transplant) after initial chemotherapy treatment has been shown in studies to increase the amount of time that patients are without symptoms of their myeloma before unfortunately their disease relapses. However, recently more effective induction chemotherapy regimens have been developed and patients treated with these new regimens are able to achieve higher and deeper responses than those previously treated on older regimens. Many also achieve complete or very good partial response, which was rare with the traditional chemotherapy regimens.\n\nSo, the investigators now do not know if giving patients an Autologous Stem Cell Transplant straight after their initial induction chemotherapy is the best thing to do. It may be that patients who respond well to a new drug containing regimen will obtain most benefit from their stem cells if these stem cells are frozen and stored, so that they can be used when their disease relapses.\n\nIn the Cardamon trial, the investigators will directly compare the outcome of patients who receive a transplant, versus those patients who do not and who instead receive Consolidation therapy. After induction treatment and stem cell harvest, patients will be randomly allocated to receive either a transplant or to receive consolidation therapy. Patients in the Cardamon trial will also be given maintenance treatment. This is treatment that is given on an ongoing basis, after the transplant or after the Consolidation therapy. The aim of maintenance treatment is to prolong disease response and delay the time to relapse.\n\nIn summary the purpose of the Cardamon study is:\n\n1. to confirm the high response rate to a new treatment regime that includes Carfilzomib plus 2 standard chemotherapy drugs used for the treatment of Multiple Myeloma,\n2. to investigate whether patients who respond well to this new Carfilzomib-containing induction regimen are able to maintain a long remission period without having an Autologous Stem Cell Transplant 'up-front', and\n3. to find out if maintenance treatment with Carfilzomib is able to further reduce the number of remaining myeloma cells in the bone marrow, using the Minimal Residual Disease test.",

    "detailed_description": "The study will be conducted over two phases.\n\nIn phase I (0-6 months), participants randomized to 'early' will receive the intervention at baseline through 6 months, while those randomized to 'late' will receive standard-of-care and represent a control arm over this period.\n\nIn phase II (6 to 12 months), those randomized to 'late' will receive the intervention at 6 months, while the 'early' group will continue in follow-up.\n\nMultifaceted Intervention The intervention aims to increase the likelihood of effecting guideline-directed change in lipid lowering therapy through two key actors - both the patient and their clinician(s). The intervention is deliberately nested within routine clinical care to enhance the generalisability of the findings beyond a research environment and to reflect other elements of real world practice.\n\n* Patient-and-clinician 'Cholesterol score card'. This passport-sized document will serve as a communication, engagement and activation tool for patients. It will be provided to participants at the commencement of the intervention and filled out at each study follow up visit. Participants will be encouraged to fill out sections at clinically-driven follow up appointments with their treating clinicians (e.g. general practitioner, cardiologist). The Score Card documents four key fields to be completed by the participant, study team and participant's regular clinician including 1) 'current' LDL-C level, 2) participant's level of adherence to lipid-lowering therapy using modified Voil's criteria, 3) lipid-lowering management decisions made at the clinician's appointment and 4) currently prescribed lipid-lowering therapies.\n* Risk stratification for recurrent events. As part of the intervention, each participant will have their SMART Risk score of a recurrent event assessed using the 'U-prevent' online calculator. In addition, each participant's Lp(a) will be measured and presented graphically on a continuum of risk. Both of these risk assessments will be sent to the treating primary care clinician and a copy provided to the participant.\n\nStandard of care Participants allocated to 'late' will receive standard-of-care for the first 6 months which involves the provision of the participant's lipid profile to their nominated primary care physician/general practitioner at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months.",

The study also aims to simplify patient access to approved targeted therapies that are contributed to the program by collaborating pharmaceutical companies and to perform next generation sequencing on tumor biopsies for biomarker analyses. Eligible patients have an advanced solid tumor, multiple myeloma or B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma for which standard treatment options are no longer available and acceptable performance status and organ function. A genomic or protein expression test must have been performed on the tumor and the results must identify at least one potentially actionable molecular variant as defined in the protocol. Results from the molecular profiling test will be used to determine an appropriate drug(s) from among those available in the protocol. The choice of drug will be supported by a list of potential profiles, a molecular tumor board, a knowledge library and by study coordinators for review and approval of the match. The protocol-specified treatment will be administered to the patient once any drug-specific eligibility criteria are confirmed and a fresh pre-treatment biopsy is performed for future genetic studies. All patients who receive treatment with a drug available in the protocol will be followed for standard efficacy outcomes including tumor response, progression-free and overall survival as well as duration of treatment. In addition, treatment related toxicity will be evaluated.",
    "detailed_description": "Problem description: evidence is building that matching targeted agents to tumor characteristics can improve outcomes. Such reports have fueled interest among patients and physicians to use molecular testing for treatment planning when standard treatment options have been exhausted. When oncologists aim to provide such personalized treatment to their patients though, obtaining the drugs can be challenging since off-label prescribing, while legal, is generally not reimbursed by insurance companies. Furthermore, outcomes of off-label treatment in routine clinical practice are not systematically recorded. As a result, the research and clinical communities have limited insight in these outcomes, leading to repetitive use of ineffective treatment for some tumor types, while effective treatment strategies might be missed for others. The latter is especially relevant for 'orphan diseases', that are too rare to conduct formal phase II and III trials. In summary, there is a lack of access to potentially effective therapy on one hand, and a lack of knowledge on broader use of such therapies on the other, altogether leading to sub-optimal use of available resources.\n\nEnvisioned solution and study aim: creation of a drug-access program, in which patients are treated with registered targeted therapy matched to their molecular tumor profile, and in which the outcomes of such therapies are recorded systematically, per tumor profile and tumor type (this is important since it is becoming increasingly clear that the tissue of origin is an important determinant of outcome of genetic abnormalities). We hereby aim to improve and broaden the use of registered targeted therapy, whilst facilitating patient access to such therapy.\n\nPlan of investigation: patients will be treated with approved targeted agents, selected based on results of a molecular profiling test of the patient's tumor. Eligible patients will have exhausted standard treatment options, and their tumor must harbor a potentially actionable molecular variant as defined in the protocol. The study will provide a tumor board to help physicians understand the profiling test results and treatment options, and will enable insights about the utility of this approach. In addition, next generation sequencing will be performed on fresh tumor biopsies for additional biomarker discovery. Patients from the Netherlands and the USA will be included in two similar though independent protocols (DRUP and TAPUR), allowing data-exchange and empowering of both trials.\n\nExpected outcome: early signs of clinical activity of approved drugs outside their label, providing effective personalized treatment options, improved patient outcomes and access to targeted therapy.",

Normal plasma (blood) cells are found in the bone marrow and are an important part of the immune system. MM is a cancer formed by malignant (cancerous) plasma cells. Daratumumab, one of the study drugs, is a man-made protein that works with your immune system by attaching itself to the cancerous cells. Once daratumumab attaches itself to these cells, it gets your body's immune system to attack and destroy the MM cells. Daratumumab has shown to be effective in subjects with MM when combined with medicines like bortezomib, or lenalidomide + dexamethasone.",

In addition, nowadays, patients candidates to an anti-EGFR-based treatment, receive anti-EGFRMoAbs in earlier lines of therapy thus affecting the translation of these results in the current clinical practice.\n\nRetrospective analyses and a phase II single-arm trial showed promising activity of anti-EGFR rechallenge in patients who previously achieved benefit from a first-line anti- EGFR-based treatment and not bearing RAS mutation on ct-DNA at the rechallenge baseline.\n\nBased on these considerations, the Investigators designed the present phase II randomized study of panitumumab followed at progression by regorafenib versus the reverse sequence in RAS and BRAF wt mCRC patients with the following characteristics:\n\n1. previous treatment with, or not considered candidates for, fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan and an anti-angiogenic agent (bevacizumab or aflibercept);\n2. RECIST response or stable disease lasting at least 6 months to a previous first-line anti-EGFR-based treatment;\n3. RAS and BRAF wt ct-DNA at the time of screening. The aim of this study is to compare the two sequences in a Caucasian population of patients candidates to anti-EGFR rechallenge.",

    "brief_summary": "ALLTogether collects the experience of previously successful treatment of infants, children and young adults, with ALL from a number of well-renowned study groups into a new master protocol, which is both a comprehensive system for stratification and treatment of ALL in this age-group as well as the basis for several randomised and interventional trials included in the study-design.",
    "detailed_description": "ALLTogether is a European clinical treatment study for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in infants, children and young adults. The aims are to improve survival and quality of survival. In young people, ALL has excellent outcome with an overall survival of about 92% in children and 75% in young adults. Infants with BCP-ALL and KMT2A-rearrangements have a worse outcome and are treated according to separate protocols, but infants with KMT2A-germline and T-cell ALL have acceptable outcome on standard ALL therapy. However, patients still die of disease - from relapse because of under-treatment and a large fraction of patients are also over-treated: All patients risk treatment-related death and some suffer long-term side-effects or secondary cancer. To show improvement with such good survival, large populations are needed.\n\nStudy groups from Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, Finland, Estonia and Lithuania (NOPHO), the UK (UKALL), the Netherlands (DCOG), Germany (COALL), Belgium (BSPHO), Portugal (SHOP), Ireland (PHOAI), and France (SFCE), have designed a common treatment protocol.\n\nThe study has a complex clinical trial design with sub-protocols (the randomisations / intervention) connected to a master protocol. The master protocol consists of well established therapy-elements and in its design typical for current ALL therapy. The master protocol therapy is in the study design considered as standard of care (SOC) therapy for infants, children and young adults with ALL.\n\nThe study structure is defined by a master protocol onto which randomised and interventional sub-protocols as well as sub-studies may be added, run and stop in a modular fashion.\n\nThe randomisations / intervention may identify therapy that is less toxic, but equally efficacious for sub-groups of patients and innovative therapy that may reduce relapses and death from ALL. In the master protocol, improved risk-stratification is likely to increase survival and reduce unnecessary toxicity and the introduction of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of Asparaginase activity will make the use of Asparaginase more rational and efficient and may thus improve overall outcomes.\n\nThe investigators hypothesise that patients stratified to the standard-risk group are over-treated. Therefore, it will be tested if the treatment can be safely reduced. In the R1 randomisation, patients will be randomised to receiving the Delayed Intensification (DI) phase of therapy with or without the anthracycline Doxorubicin.\n\nA similar hypothesis of over-treatment will also be tested in patients stratified to the intermediate risk-low group. In the R2 randomisation patients will be randomly assigned to either removal of Doxorubicin during the DI phase or removal of Vincristine and Dexamethasone pulses during the maintenance phase or to the control group, which will be treated with Doxorubicin in DI as well as Vincristine and Dexamethasone pulses during maintenance. Patients will only be randomised once.\n\nRandomisation R1 and R2 are only considered for children since adults have worse outcome and very poor survival after relapse, but the risk-stratification is likely to reduce the number of high-risk cases also in the adult-group.\n\nPatients stratified as intermediate risk-high (IR-high) are identified as having an increased risk of relapse and thus a less favourable prognosis than the standard- and intermediate risk-low groups, but a more favourable prognosis than the high risk patients. The majority of all relapses in childhood ALL is expected to occur in the IR-high group. Following a relapse, only approximately 40% of the children can be successfully treated again and for adults the corresponding figure is less than 20 %, so preventing relapses is very important. New treatment options that improves the antileukaemic efficacy and which have an improved safety profile are urgently needed.\n\nFor IR-high patients Randomisation 3 (R3) is available. In R3 patients will be randomised to receive either:\n\n1. the addition of two cycles of Inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) - Besponsa\u00ae, before start of the maintenance phase. After these cycles, the patients randomised to the InO arm will receive maintenance for the same duration as in the control arm.\n2. the addition of low dose 6-tioguanine (6TG) as an addition to the standard maintenance therapy.\n3. standard maintenance therapy\n\nPatients with ABL-class fusions in their leukaemic clone will, as a non-randomised experimental intervention, be treated with an addition of a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor during the induction phase (for patients \\<25 years) and from the consolidation phase (patients \u226525 years). This intervention may shift therapy for previously resistant cases to lower intensity treatment with the associated reduced morbidity and may also reduce the number of relapses in analogy with the results in Ph+ ALL. The reason for not performing a randomised comparison is the rarity of the aberration and also the diversity of ABL-class fusions, reducing statistical power for any comparison further. For this reason, the results of this intervention may be pooled with other study-groups trying similar approaches.\n\nA new intervention is introduced for Down syndrome patients with CD19 positive ALL: ALLTogether1 DS (NRI2). For Down syndrome-ALL patients who have end of Induction MRD detectable but \\<25% two conventional chemotherapy consolidation blocks will be replaced with two blocks of Blinatumomab.\n\nFor high-risk B-lineage patients, CAR-T therapy can be an alternative to high-risk blocks and stem-cell transplant, but in this case the intervention (CAR-T infusion) will be performed outside the ALLTogether1 study. However, the stratification-system in ALLTogether1 will define the population with a potential CAR-T indication.\n\nALLTogether1 also includes five sub-studies:\n\nEfficacy and pharmacokinetics of Imatinib in ABL-class fusion positive ALL\n\nTarget population: All ABL-class patients enrolled in the ALLTogether study. Biomaterials to be collected at diagnosis, during TKI treatment, follow-up and relapse.\n\nAims\n\n1. To determine the efficacy and dosing target of imatinib in the treatment of ABL-class leukemia\n2. To find the best discriminative biomarkers for TKI response in ABL-class ALL\n3. To determine the frequency of intrinsic (at diagnosis) and acquired TKI resistance (due to treatment), including backtracking of mutations using imatinib PK/PD findings during treatment\n4. To find causes of TKI resistance in ABL-class patients\n5. To describe the pharmacokinetics of Imatinib in TKI-treated patients\n\nObjectives\n\n1. To determine the percent of ABL-class patients who need to switch from IR-high to HR because of high MRD levels\n2. To determine the effect of imatinib exposure on clinical outcome, including pharmacokinetic measurements of imatinib\n3. To determine the molecular response to imatinib by monitoring fusion gene levels and mutational spectrum at diagnosis and during follow up\n4. To determine whether the molecular response parameters reflect the Ig/TCR MRD or flow-MRD response or are a better predictor of therapy failure than Ig/TCR or flow-based MRD monitoring\n5. To determine the phosphorylation status of ABL-class proteins and presence of TKI-resistance associated mutations in ABL genes prior to imatinib treatment and the emergence of such mutations during treatment with imatinib\n6. To determine the presence of mutations in regulatory /other genes before and during imatinib treatment and functionally address the importance of these mutations in TKI resistance\n7. To determine whether the efficacy of TKIs depends on the type of fusion gene\n8. To describe inter- and intraindividual variations in imatinib PK (=trough levels) during therapy of ABL-class ALL\n9. To describe associations between PK of imatinib and end-of-induction MRD (\\<25 yrs only) and end-of-consolidation MRD (all patients)\n10. To describe associations between imatinib PK and relapse rates (overall, bone-marrow and CNS), event-free survival as well as overall survival;\n11. To describe associations between imatinib PK and toxicities (including e.g. height z-scores at diagnosis and end of therapy, pancreatitis, treatment delays) with focus on those toxicities that are routinely monitored in ALLTogether.\n\nBiomarkers to Reform Approaches to therapy-Induced Neurotoxicity (BRAIN)\n\nTarget population: All patients registered on ALLTogether1 aged \u2265 4 years at end of therapy (Arm A) and all patients registered on ALLTogether1 aged 4-21 years at start of therapy (Arm B) and without:\n\n1. Pre-existing neurodevelopmental delay (e.g Trisomy 21) prior to diagnosis of ALL\n2. Significant visual or motor impairment preventing use of a touch screen ipad\n\nAll centres are invited to enrol to arm A (Main BRAIN) of the study. Arm B (Longitudinal BRAIN) will be carried out in selected centres.\n\nAims\n\n1. To implement universal screening of all children for adverse neurocognitive outcomes at the end of treatment using a validated user-friendly computer software programme (CogState) and compare neurocognitive outcomes by treatment allocation (Arm A).\n2.

To investigate whether negative FCM identifies a group of children at very low risk of CNS relapse, suitable for testing de-escalation of CNS-directed therapy in future trials.\n3. To investigate whether positive FCM can identify children at increased risk of CNS relapse and whether patients with persistent positivity (FCM positive at day 15 onwards) might benefit from studies testing escalated CNS-directed therapy or a switch to more intensive treatment arms.\n4. To collect matching CSF supernatant for studies comparing CSF FCM with soluble biomarkers (e.g. metabolic, cell-free DNA, proteomic and microRNA).\n\nMaintenance therapy pharmacokinetics/-dynamics study\n\nTarget population: All patients included in the ALLTogether1 protocol are eligible for participation.

    "brief_summary": "The goal of this implementation trial is to learn if providing education to doctors and patients who have had a heart event works to prevent future heart problems. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Does educating the doctors in a health system improve how often patients in the hospital for a heart event have their cholesterol checked?\n2. Can a \"care champion\" who calls patients who have been discharged from the hospital after a heart event help patients to achieve their cholesterol goals?\n\nResearchers will compare the number of people who achieve their cholesterol goals with the help of the care champion to the number of people who did so without the intervention to see if the care champion works to help patients lower their cholesterol.\n\nParticipants will:\n\nComplete two 15 minute surveys over the phone - 1 at enrollment and 1 at the end of the study 6 months later.",
    "detailed_description": "Data Collection\n\nData will be collected from several sources:\n\nClinical Research Coordinator (CRC) will enter patient data into the Case Report Form (CRF) Baseline clinical data from the electronic health record (EHR)\n\nBaseline clinical data and patient reported outcomes (PROs) (from patient)\n\n6-month clinical data (from EHR) 6-month clinical data and PROs (from patient) 8-month clinical data (from EHR) - only to collect post-study low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) values Care champion will record data around process (i.e. number of calls to each patient, etc) Care champion will record data on adaptations to intervention at each site on monthly basis CRC will enter screening vs enrollment data into CRF\n\nData Protection Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by their enrolling site. All participant data that are transferred to Duke will contain the identifier only; participant names or any information which would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred.\n\nSafety Management and Reporting of Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events As the intervention only promotes guideline adherence to care, and no medications are being prescribed by study personnel, this is a low-risk study and the investigators will not routinely collect safety or adverse events data. Clinical event data (including hospitalizations, death, MI, stroke, and coronary revascularization) will be collected during the study period by health record check and by discussion with the patients. However, clinical events will not be formally adjudicated; they will be reported and affirmed by site PI.\n\nStatistical Hypotheses, Randomization, and Sample Size Determination Hypotheses On average, patients in the treatment arm with have a larger change in LDL level compared to the usual care arm.\n\nH_0: \u03b2_trt= 0 H_a: \u03b2_trt\u2260 0\n\nRandomization Participants will be randomized with a 1:1 allocation at the site level.\n\nSample Size Determination Sample size determination was done using a 2-level hierarchical mixed model design where patients (level-1) are randomized within sites (level-2) into two arms. The arms are treatment and control arms. Assuming a mean change in LDL of 18.9 mg/dL with a standard difference of 38.8 mg/dL, \u03c1=0.05, \u03b1=0.05, and 6 clusters, the planned overall sample size of n=400 should be sufficiently powered.\n\nTotal Subjects Group 1 Group 2 Clusters Subjects Per Cluster in Group 1 Subjects Per Cluster in Group 2 Mean Difference SD ICC Power N N1 N2 K M1 M2 \u03b4 \u03c3 \u03c1 Alpha 0.99729 360 180 180 6 30 30 18.9 38.8 0.05 0.05 0.99871 396 198 198 6 33 33 18.9 38.8 0.05 0.05 0.99899 408 204 204 6 34 34 18.9 38.8 0.05 0.05 0.99921 420 210 210 6 35 35 18.9 38.8 0.05 0.05 0.99978 480 240 240 6 40 40 18.9 38.8 0.05 0.05 Power calculations were computed using PASS 2023, version 23.0.2.\n\nPlanned Statistical Analysis Patients admitted for MI and/or coronary percutaneous revascularization who have an admission LDL level \u2265 70 mg/dL and have a primary care clinician and/or cardiologist within the same health system (same EHR).\n\nPatients will be randomized 1:1 at the site level to either usual care or an interventional arm with a care champion to improve post-discharge LDL management. Patients would be expected to get their LDL re-checked post-discharge as part of guideline recommended care. However, this does not always happen and the intervention is meant to increase the adherence to this standard as well as appropriate medication titration, when indicated. At 6 months post-discharge all patients who have not already had their LDL checked post-discharge will be prompted to do so. At 8 months post-discharge, the CRC will do an EHR review to obtain last LDL values.\n\nPrimary Objectives The primary endpoint is within-patient change in LDL from admission LDL level to last LDL checked post-discharge within 8 months post-discharge (6 months of intervention and a 2-month post-study window to capture LDL). The investigators will model the association between treatment group and last known LDL value using linear regression, adjusting for admission LDL level, age, sex, and race. Random intercepts will be used to account for clustered data by site.\n\nMissing Final LDL Values The investigators expect some patients in each arm to never get their LDL checked within the 6-month follow-up window. For these patients, the CRC will contact both the patient and their primary providers (PCP and/or cardiologist) at 6-months post-discharge to encourage them to get their LDL checked, per standard of care. The CRC will then do an EHR review at 8-months post-discharge to obtain any LDL values that have been recorded.\n\nFor those who have been contacted but still do not have an LDL level recorded by 8 months post-discharge, the investigators will assign their admission value as their final value if there have been no apparent lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) changes in the EHR. If this group is \\>5% of either treatment arm the investigators will estimate temporal variability in LDL levels and further account for regression to the mean and chance variation. The investigators will use our existing cohort to estimate this variability.\n\nFor those who do not have an LDL level recorded by 8 months post-discharge but do have a record of LLT changes within 6 months post-discharge, the investigators will conditionally impute final LDL based on other patients with similar LLT changes who have a final LDL level. Clinically relevant LLT change categories (e.g., increase from low/moderate to high intensity statin; addition of non-statin therapies such as PCSK9i mAb or siRNA, ezetimibe, or bempedoic acid) will be created. The investigators will use these change categories with other relevant covariates to impute final LDL levels. Our imputation approach will be a model-based multiple imputation using the fully conditional specification method. For patients whose LLT change category is not well represented in our data, the investigators will use an expected reduction based on current literature. The investigators will do sensitivity analyses varying the expected reduction thresholds.\n\nProportions will be calculated by treatment arm and compared with logistic regression using random intercepts to account for clustered data by site. Means will be calculated by treatment arm and compared with linear regression using random intercepts to account for clustered data by site. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses will be done. Adjusted models will adjust for age, sex, and race.\n\nBinary outcomes will be analyzed with logistic regression. Time to event outcomes will be analyzed with Cox proportional hazards model. The proportional hazards assumption will be assessed with Schoenfeld residuals. For all models, unadjusted and adjusted (for age, sex, and race) models will be calculated. All models will also use random intercepts to account for clustered data by site.",

    "detailed_description": "According to international guidelines, outside clinical trials, frontline autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is the standard of care for fit patients less than 71 years of age, who are newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma.\n\nTriplet combinations are now the backbone of induction therapy prior to ASCT. KRD (Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, Dexamethasone) is potentially the more active regimen.\n\nQuadruplet combinations are under evaluation. The prospective phase 3 CASSIOPEIA trial conducted by the IFM and HOVON cooperative groups investigated the outcome of transplant-eligible patients treated with VTD (Bortezomib, Thalidomide, Dexamethasone) +/- Daratumumab administered both before (induction, 4 cycles) and after (consolidation, 2 cycles) single ASCT prepared by Melphalan 200 mg/m2.5 The addition of Daratumumab to VTD during induction induced significantly higher response rates, but also higher minimal residual disease (MRD) - negativity rates. The high response rates achieved after induction (MRD negativity rates at 10-5 by 8-color flow cytometry 35% (188/543) in the VTD-Dara arm vs 23% (125/542) after 4 cycles of VTD in the intent-to-treat population), but also after consolidation and before maintenance (MRD negativity rates at 10-5 by 8-color flow cytometry 63% in the VTD-Dara arm vs 43% in the VTD in the intent-to-treat population), translated into a significant improvement in progression-free-survival (PFS) in the Daratumumab arm of the study: 18-month PFS 93% vs 85% before maintenance, HR 0.47 (0.33-0.67), p \\< 0.0001. Cassiopeia is the first study showing a correlation between MRD negativity after induction (before ASCT) and PFS benefit, in the setting of quadruplet combination induction. Based on these results, VTD + daratumumab was recently approved by the FDA and EMA.\n\nKRD has also been combined with Daratumumab in several phase 2 trials. Early results indicate that this quadruplet combination might potentially be the most effective regimen prior to ASCT in terms of response and MRD-negativity rates. Carfilzomib was administered intravenously weekly, on days 1, 8 and 15 of 28 day-cycles at the dose of 56 mg/m\u00b2. Based on 70 patients, the MRD-negativity rate after four cycles of KRD-Daratumumab was 39% at a detection level of 10-5 by next generation sequencing (NGS). The weekly KRD-Daratumumab regimen was associated with low toxicity, and stem cell harvest was adequate. The rate of MRD negativity in 42 patients further improved after single ASCT, to 67% and 43% at a detection level of 10-5 and of 10-6 by NGS, respectively. Due to the short 7.9 months median follow-up time at the time of presentation, no PFS data were presented. At ASCO 2020, Weisel et al reported the results of induction based on 6 cycles of KRD plus Isatuximab, in patients with high-risk cytogenetics.8 In this interim analysis on the first 46 patients eligible for ASCT with high-risk disease, the overall response rate was 100%, including 60% MRD negativity at 10-5 by NGS after induction and before ASCT. No death on study was reported. No data are yet available regarding MRD negativity rates after ASCT or PFS. At ASH 2019, Landgren et al. reported the results of eight weekly KRD-Daratumumab cycles without ASCT in a small phase 2 study on 41 patients after a short median follow-up time of 8.6 months.\n\nOn the same intent-to-treat basis, MRD-negativity rate at a detection level of 10-5 by NGS was 61% and 65% in patients after six and eight cycles, respectively, including a very good partial response (VGPR) rate or better of 85% after 8 cycles and an overall response rate (ORR) of 100%. No death on study was seen. At the time of the report, no patient with MRD-negative disease had progressed. Despite the short follow-up time, based on the high rate of MRD-negativity and the 0% relapse rate achieved so far with this quadruplet combination, the authors of this small phase 2 series now propose to systematically delay ASCT in patients with standard-risk disease. This provocative recommendation requires validation in a phase 3 randomized trial comparing frontline versus delayed ASCT in patients with MRD-negative disease after induction.\n\nPatients MRD positive after quadruplet induction are at higher risk of disease progression. For patients with high-risk (HR) disease, tandem ASCT has been proposed in order to improve PFS and overall survival (OS). In an integrated analysis of four phase III studies independently conducted by HOVON/GMMG, IFM, PETHEMA/GEM and GIMEMA European cooperative groups, in the era of Bortezomib-based induction regimens, double ASCT significantly improved PFS and OS in HR patients.\n\nIn the EMN02/HO95 study, in centers with a policy of double ASCT, patients were assigned to receive VMP (Bortezomib, Melphalan, Prednisone), single ASCT (ASCT-1) or two planned ASCTs (ASCT-2) to prospectively compare ASCT-1 with ASCT-2. Patients who received ASCT-2 had a prolonged PFS compared to those who received ASCT-1. Importantly, ASCT-2 overcame the adverse prognosis conferred by high-risk cytogenetics. In the same study, OS from the first randomization was significantly prolonged with ASCT-2 as compared with ASCT-1, a benefit also seen in subgroups of patients with adverse prognosis, including those with R-ISS stage II+III and high-risk cytogenetics. To date, no prospective trial has compared single vs tandem ASCT in HR patients in the era of quadruplet induction combinations.\n\nAfter ASCT, a systematic maintenance is recommended by International Guidelines. Lenalidomide is approved in this setting, and proposed until progression. Other agents or combinations are under evaluation for maintenance, such as Ixazomib, Elotuzumab, Daratumumab or Isatuximab. Iberdomide is a next generation cereblon targeting agent, with antitumor and immunostimulatory activities in Lenalidomide- and Pomalidomide-resistant multiple myeloma. This oral agent, which could be the ideal agent for maintenance therapy, is currently tested after ASCT. Phase 2 and 3 randomized studies are currently investigating the combination of Lenalidomide with anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies as maintenance therapy after autologous stem cell transplant. We assume that a fixed duration of maintenance using Iberdomide and Isatuximab will induce a high-rate of sustained MRD negativity.",

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as isatuximab, may induce changes in the body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Carfilzomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone and lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving isatuximab and carfilzomib with or without dexamethasone and lenalidomide may be a better treatment for patients with multiple myeloma.",
    "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nARM 1: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR650984 in combination with standard carfilzomib (Arm 1 is complete).\n\nARM 2: To determine the safety AND efficacy (objective response rate (ORR)) of adding SAR650984 10mg/kg weekly x 4 doses then every other week in combination with weekly carfilzomib (70 mg/m2) and dexamethasone, in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma. ORR will be defined using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response criteria.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nARM 1:\n\n1. To evaluate the safety, including immunogenicity (ARM 1), of SAR650984 in combination with carfilzomib, in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma after receiving 1+ prior lines of therapy. The severity, frequency and incidence of all toxicities will be assessed.\n2. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SAR650984 and carfilzomib when administered in ARM 1 (completed).\n3. To assess the relationship between clinical (adverse event and/or tumor response) effects and pharmacologic parameters (PK/PD), and/or biologic (correlative laboratory) results.\n4. To estimate the activity (ORR) using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) defined response criteria of SAR650984 plus carfilzomib (ARM 1)\n5. To describe progression free survival (PFS), time to disease progression (TTP) and 1-year overall survival (OS) in patients treated with SAR650984 plus standard carfilzomib, and SAR650984 with weekly carfilzomib and dexamethasone.\n\nEXPANSION COHORTS:\n\nARM 1:\n\n1. To further evaluate safety, PK, PD and to estimate the anti-tumor activity (response rates) using IMWG defined response criteria of study therapy (SAR650984 plus carfilzomib).\n\nARM 1 and 2:\n\n1. To describe progression-free survival, 1-year OS, and TTP in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma treated with these combinations.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of isatuximab. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1, and orally (PO) or IV on days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles. Patients receive isatuximab IV over 4-6 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1 and days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles, and carfilzomib IV over 10 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue treatment after 8 cycles if clinical benefit is present at the investigator's discretion (carfilzomib may be switched to days 1, 2, 15, and 16 per investigator discretion).\n\nARM II: Patients receive dexamethasone IV or PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, isatuximab IV over 4-6 hours on 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1 and days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles, and carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 60 days and then every 3 months for up to 3 years.",

The natural herpes simplex 1 virus typically causes cold sores around the mouth, but the talimogene laherparepvec version of the herpes virus has been changed to prevent it from reproducing in normal tissue.\n\nHowever, it can still attack and break open cancer tissue which is why it is used as a treatment for cancer. It is thought that this virus can also help recruit the participant's immune system to attack the cancer cells during their treatment and possibly destroy the tumor tissue more effectively than chemotherapy alone. This virus is already FDA approved to treat melanoma skin tumors, so investigators want to determine if this virus can achieve a similar benefit in women with triple negative breast tumors.",

    "brief_summary": "Gastric and gastro-oesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinomas rank as the fifth leading cause of cancer globally. The standard treatment for resectable non-metastatic cT2-T4NX gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma is perioperative FLOT chemotherapy. In the FLOT4 trial, which included 55% of GEJ and 45% of gastric tumours, the FLOT chemotherapy regimen improved both disease-free survival and overall survival compared to the ECF/ECX regimen. The median overall survival was 50 months, and median disease-free survival was 30 months for the FLOT experimental arm. About 16% of patients achieved a pathological complete regression (TRG1a) in the modified ITT population treated by FLOT. For GEJ adenocarcinoma, the ESOPEC trial has recently demonstrated the superiority of FLOT regimen compared to radiochemotherapy (CROSS regimen) \\[ median overall survival 66 months for FLOT regimen vs 37months \\[HR 0.7 95% IC (0.53-0.92) p= 0.012\\].\n\nGenomic analyses of gastric and GEJ adenocarcinomas conducted by the Cancer Genome Network Atlas have identified four distinct subtypes of tumours based on their gene expression profile. These subtypes include tumours positive for Epstein-Barr virus, microsatellite unstable tumours, genomically stable tumours, and tumours with chromosomal instability. This research has identified oncogenic driver alterations, leading to new targeted therapies and therapeutic strategies.\n\nHER2 amplification and MSI status are current targets for targeted therapies with anti-HER2 antibodies and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI), respectively. Trials using these therapies in perioperative settings are ongoing with promising preliminary results. However, targeted therapies are not currently available in the non-metastatic setting.\n\nThe overexpression of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 (FGFR2) is a frequent molecular alteration in gastric and GEJ tumours, presenting a potential new therapeutic target. FGFR2b overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and can be detected through pre-screening by immunohistochemistry. Bemarituzumab, a monoclonal antibody specific to the splice-variant FGFR2b, has shown promising results in combination with chemotherapy in phase 2 trials.\n\nBased on the frequency of FGFR2b overexpression, the tolerability of combination therapy with chemotherapy, and the need to improve survival rates for gastric and GEJ cancer patients, it is proposed to test the efficacy of the combination of FLOT chemotherapy and bemarituzumab in the perioperative setting for c T2-T4a or N+ gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma MSS and overexpressing FGFR2b.",

    "detailed_description": "This study is a multi-center phase 2 study of carfilzomib, lenalidomide, daratumumab, and dexamethasone in subjects with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). Myeloma remains incurable with the current approaches. The typical natural history of myeloma is one of repeated relapses, accompanied by genetic evolution and development of new abnormalities, which are often responsible for drug resistance. The presence of a precursor phase of smoldering myeloma, and the ability to identify those at the highest risk of progression, sets the stage to examine the possibility that we can cure the disease through early intervention. In order to potentially achieve this, we need to develop a highly effective combination that includes the most active drugs from different classes. Carfilzomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone results in high response rates and deep responses in subjects with newly diagnosed myeloma. Daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide results in high response rates in relapsed refractory disease. All these drugs are well tolerated and subjects are able to stay on them long term as a maintenance treatment. The combination of the carfilzomib, lenalidomide, daratumumab and dexamethasone presents the potential to enhance the effectiveness of the regimens. We hypothesize that this combination will lead to deep response including a higher proportion of minimal residual disease (MRD) negative disease among those with high risk smoldering myeloma and may translate into cure or long term disease quiescence.",

    "brief_summary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if romosozumab (Evenity) can improve bone and muscle health in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are undergoing lumbar spine surgery. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does romosozumab improve bone strength and reduce the risk of complications during and after spine surgery?\n* Does romosozumab increase muscle mass and help patients recover better from surgery?\n\nResearchers will compare romosozumab (a monthly injection) to alendronate (a weekly pill), both approved treatments for osteoporosis, to see which is more effective in this surgical setting. Participants will:\n\n* Be randomly assigned to receive romosozumab or alendronate\n* Take standard vitamin supplements and receive a one-time dose of zoledronic acid near the end of the study\n* Attend five study visits over about 12 months\n* Undergo bone scans, muscle imaging, and complete health questionnaires before and after surgery",

Participants will receive 3 doses/autoinjectors of study drug or placebo and be instructed to perform injections every 14 days starting 5 weeks prior to their scheduled AAA repair. If the baseline assessment occurs 5 weeks prior to their scheduled AAA, the first injection will be performed during this visit. Participants will have the option of coming back to the site for injections 2 and 3 or perform these injections at home under telehealth supervision. At the time of open AAA repair, participants will repeat laboratory tests and have a sample of aneurysm tissue taken. Participants will then have a follow up phone call 4 weeks after AAA repair to assess for any adverse events. At the conclusion of the study investigators will examine gene expression and protein levels in the aortic tissue to determine the impact of LDL-C lowering with evolocumab.",

The efficacy of these interventions will be evaluated using a randomized control design.",
    "detailed_description": "ROCQ is a patient health-management programme and prospective cohort study. Within the ROCQ programme, educational interventions to improve osteoporosis management will be evaluated using a randomized-control design. The programme is composed of a promotional campaign, three main phases and a 20-year follow-up.\n\nAt phase 1, 0 to 16 weeks after the fracture, participants with fragility and traumatic fractures will be recruited and will be asked information regarding their fracture.\n\nAt phase 2, 6 to 8 months after the fracture, all participants will complete questionnaires to evaluate demographic and clinical features, risk factors for osteoporosis, co-morbidities, status of diagnosis and treatment, and the EQ-5D. The current medical management of osteoporosis (or the care gap in diagnosis and treatment) will be measured using this questionnaire at phase 2. Once the phase 2 questionnaire has been completed, Only participants with fragility fractures will be randomized to one of the three following educational intervention groups: 1) the Educational Video Group, 2) the Documentation Group, or 3) the Control Group.\n\nAt phase 3, 12 to 14 months after randomization, the effectiveness of the interventions will be assessed by re-administering the questionnaires to participants who experienced a fragility fracture at baseline. The questionnaires evaluate the status of diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis, modifiable risk factors and the health-related quality of life (EQ-5D). The impact of the interventions on the participants will be assessed by comparing diagnosis and treatments rates in each intervention arm.\n\nIf the long-term viability of the programme is secured, participants with fragility and traumatic fractures will be followed for a maximum period of 20 years using specific encoded personal data contained in the RAMQ and Quebec's drug plan databases.",

However, the FDA has approved pembrolizumab by itself for melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nPembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, or specialized type of protein, produced in the laboratory for use in treating patients with the participant disease. Pembrolizumab is designed to augment the natural ability of the immune system to recognize and target cancer cells.\n\nAMG386 is a drug that may kill tumor cells and blocks blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients and oxygen. Drugs that block blood vessel formation are called \"anti-angiogenic\" therapies. AMG386 has been used and is currently being used in other clinical trials treating different types of cancer. Information from these other clinical trials suggests that this drug may help stop tumor growth.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are interested in looking at the combination of AMG386 with pembrolizumab because research done in the laboratory has suggested that the immunotherapy effect could be limited by the presence of tumor vessels in a process called angiogenesis. Adding AMG386 to pembrolizumab may help overcome this limitation and augment the effect of pembrolizumab.\n\nThis combination of study drugs is being researched to:\n\n* Determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab and AMG386 at different dose levels.\n* Determine the side effects of pembrolizumab and AMG386 when they are given in combination\n* Determine if pembrolizumab in combination with AMG386 is a possible treatment for cancer\n* Determine if pembrolizumab in combination with AMG386 changes immune cells in the blood or tumor",

Early Intensification therapy will be given prior to Consolidation to patients with provisional standard-risk or high-risk ALL/LLy or any provisional low-risk patients with Day 15 MRD \u22651% as well as provisional low-risk LLy patients who do not obtain complete response at the end of Induction. Patients with mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) are treated by using the same treatment stratification used in ALL although analysis is performed separately from ALL or LLy cohorts.\n\nBrief outline of treatment plan:\n\nPatients will be assigned to treatment based on risk group: Low-Risk, Standard-Risk and High-Risk and cell type (T or B cell).\n\nRemission Induction initially consists of prednisone (28 days), vincristine (4 weekly doses), daunorubicin (1 to 3 weekly doses), and pegaspargase 1 dose for all patients and 2 doses for those with Day 15 MRD 1% or higher. The second part (given over 2 weeks and overlapping with the last week of the first part of induction) consists of cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, and mercaptopurine combinations. Dasatinib will be added for patients with Ph+ and Ph-like ABL-class fusions and bortezomib will be given to patients with no targetable lesions and Day 15 or Day 22 minimal residual disease (MRD) \u2265 5% on Days 29 and 32.\n\nEarly Intensification will be given prior to Consolidation to patients with provisional standard-risk or high-risk ALL/LLy or any provisional low-risk patients with Day 15 MRD \u22651% as well as provisional low-risk LLy patients who do not obtain complete response at the end of Induction.

This includes, but is not limited to CRLF2, JAK2, and EPOR rearrangements and sequence/structural changes in JAK1/2, TYK2, IL7R, and SH2B3. Ruxolitinib will be added in LLy patients with activation of JAK-STAT signaling that can be inhibited by ruxolitinib whose responses do not qualify complete response at the end of Remission Induction. Dasatinib will continue for patients with ABL-class fusions. Bortezomib will be added for patients with no targetable lesions and Day 15 or Day 22 MRD \u2265 5% or LLy patients without complete response at the End of Induction.\n\nConsolidation Treatment will consist of high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) (every other week for 4 doses); daily mercaptopurine and IT chemotherapy on the same dates of HDMTX. Dasatinib will continue for patients with ABL-class fusions. Ruxolitinib will continue for patients with activation of JAK-STAT signaling that can be inhibited by ruxolitinib and Day 15 or Day 22 MRD \u22655% or Day 42 MRD \u22651% (or for LLy patients who do not qualify complete response at the end of Remission Induction) and all cases with ETP ALL and T/M MPAL.\n\nImmunotherapy: CAR T-cell therapy will be considered for High-risk B-ALL and B-LLy patients. Blinatumomab will be given to patients with Standard-risk B-ALL and B-LLy with residual disease at the end of induction and High-risk B-ALL and B-LLy patients who are not able to receive CAR T-cell therapy. Blinatumomab is also given to patients with the following genetic subtypes (BCR-ABL1, ABL-class fusion, JAK-STAT activating mutation, hypodiploid, iAMP21, ETV6-RUNX1-like, MEF2D, TCF3/HLF, or BCL2/MYC) or with Down syndrome, regardless of MRD level and/or Total 17 risk category.\n\nReintensification therapy will be offered to certain High-risk patients with persistent MRD after Immunotherapy (B-ALL and B-LLy) or Early Intensification (T-ALL and T-LLy), or those who cannot receive Immunotherapy.\n\nContinuation Treatment will consist of 120 weeks of risk-directed therapy. Dasatinib will continue in patients with ABL-class fusion. Ruxolitinib will continue in patients with activation of JAK-STAT signaling that can be inhibited by ruxolitinib and Day 15 or Day 22 MRD \u22655% or Day 42 MRD \u22651% (or for LLy patients who do not qualify complete response at the end of Remission Induction) and all cases with ETP ALL. T-ALL and T-LLy patients with leukemia/lymphoma cells in cerebrospinal fluid at diagnosis or MRD \u22650.01% at the end of Induction will receive nelarabine. ALL/LLy Patients with the CEP72 rs904627T/T genotype (16% of patients) will be randomized (unblinded design except those who evaluate neuropathies) to receive either 1.5 mg/m2 or 1 mg/m2 of vincristine after Continuation Week 1. Patients in low- risk will complete vincristine in Week 49 and those in standard/high-risk will complete in Week 101. Standard/high-risk patients with either a CEP72 rs904627 C/T or C/C genotype (84% of patients) will be randomized to receive vincristine and dexamethasone pulses through Week 49 of Continuation Treatment or through Week 101 of Continuation Treatment. Low-risk patients will complete vincristine in Week 49.\n\nIntrathecal therapy is given throughout the treatment. The number of intrathecal therapy is based on the risk factors of central nervous system relapse.",

    "brief_summary": "This phase I/Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of carfilzomib when given together with rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage I-IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that has returned (relapsed) or that has not responded to treatment (refractory). Carfilzomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide, also work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving carfilzomib with rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide may be a better treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.",
    "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n* I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and examine the dose-limiting toxicities of carfilzomib when administered in combination with rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (C-R-ICE) in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). (Phase I)\n* II. To assess the toxicity of dose regimen using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0). (Phase I)\n* III. To evaluate the safety of carfilzomib (given at maximum tolerated dose \\[MTD\\] as determined in Phase I of this study) in combination with R-ICE salvage therapy in relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients. (Phase Ib)\n* IV. To achieve an overall response rate (complete response \\[CR\\] and partial response \\[PR\\]) of 70% after 3 cycles of C-R-ICE in patients between the ages of 18 to 75 with relapsed/refractory cluster of differentiation (CD)20-positive DLBCL previously treated with rituximab-based immunochemotherapy (e.g., rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine \\[vincristine sulfate\\], and prednisone \\[R-CHOP\\], rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin \\[REPOCH\\], rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, methotrexate, and cytarabine \\[R-HyperCVAD\\], etc.) induction. (Phase Ib)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n* I. To determine the feasibility of successful mobilization of autologous stem cells (i.e., minimum of 2 x 10\\^6 CD34+ cells/kg should be collected) to be used for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)\n* II. To determine toxicities associated with C-R-ICE salvage therapy\n* III. To determine the time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) followed by ASCT; disease-free survival in CR patients.\n* IV. To determine the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics relationship between carfilzomib's degree of proteasome inhibition and response rate along with the time course of thrombocytopenia\n* V. To study differences in clinical outcomes between germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) and non-GCB relapsed/refractory DLBCL following therapy with carfilzomib and R-ICE\n* VI. Correlative translational research studies to include: phenotypic/genotypic analysis and functional activity (i.e., antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity \\[ADCC\\] and complement-mediated cytotoxicity \\[CMC\\]) of patient's peripheral blood mononuclear \"effector\" cells (PBMC), as well as ex vivo analysis of sensitivity of primary tumor cells to various combinations of carfilzomib versus bortezomib +/- rituximab; enzymatic assay for chymotrypsin-like activity to determine the degree of proteasome inhibition in primary DLBCL patient samples and patient PBMC specimens; explorative analysis to identify potential factors predictive of response to therapy will be performed.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of carfilzomib, followed by a phase Ib study.\n\nPatients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 10-30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, and 9; rituximab IV over 3-8 hours on day 3; etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 4-6; carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 5; and ifosfamide IV over 24 hours on day 5. Treatment repeats every 21-28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 2 years.",
