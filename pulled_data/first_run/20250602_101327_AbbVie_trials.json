    "brief_summary": "Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease causing pain, stiffness, swelling and loss of joint function. This study will assess how safe and effective upadacitinib is in treating RA when compared to adalimumab in adult participants with inadequate response or intolerance to one TNF-inhibitor who are on a stable dose of methotrexate (MTX). Adverse events and change in disease activity will be assessed.\n\nUpadacitinib is an approved drug for the treatment of RA. This study is double-blinded means that neither the participants nor the study doctors will know who will be given upadacitinib and who will be given adalimumab. Study doctors put the participants in 1 of the 2 groups, called treatment arms randomly, to receive either upadacitinib or adalimumab. There is 1 in 2 chance that participants will receive adalimumab. Each group consists of 2 periods. Approximately 480 participants diagnosed with RA will be enrolled in approximately 250 sites across the world.\n\nParticipants will receive the oral upadacitinib once daily and matching adalimumab placebo every other week, or the subcutaneous adalimumab every other week and matching upadacitinib placebo once daily during Period 1. Eligible participants will continue to receive same study treatment in Period 2 as assigned in Period 1 and will be followed for 30 days and 70 days.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.",

The addition of Venetoclax to HR patients after R-BAC is expected to improve results and efficacy of this regimen in this \"difficult -to- treat\" population, that represents approximately 40-45 % of newly diagnosed elderly patients with MCL. It appears reasonable to treat with the experimental drug also LR patients that do not respond appropriately (less than CR) at the end of R-BAC. Since the number of such LR patients is hardly predictable based on the present experience with R-BAC500 trial, the analysis of this sub-cohort will be of exploratory nature, and thus assessed separately.\n\nThe study objective is to evaluate whether the addition of venetoclax after R-BAC to HR patients improves the results of the standard R-BAC, in terms of Progression Free Survival .",

    "detailed_description": "Siltuximab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks interleukin-6 (IL-6) from binding to its receptor, preventing it from acting. IL-6 is a cytokine, a type of protein that is a cause of inflammatory reactions. Decreasing levels of IL-6 has been shown to reduce symptoms of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a potential side effect of epcoritamab. Addition of siltuximab to the medications given before epcoritamab, may prevent, or reduce the severity, of CRS. Siltuximab is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment or prevention of CRS. Epcoritamab is a so-called bispecific antibody, which is a molecule that can bind simultaneously to two different receptors. Epcoritamab binds to a receptor called CD3 with one part of the antibody and to a receptor called CD20 with another part of the antibody. CD20 is expressed on the normal, healthy B cells but also on the cancerous lymphoma cells of B cell origin. CD3 is expressed on T cells, which are important cells of the immune system and help the body fight cancers, infections, etc. By simultaneous binding to CD3 and CD20, Epcoritamab brings T cells and B cells close together and activates the T cells to kill the B cells, including the cancerous ones.",

Intraoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT), a diagnostic device, can be used to evaluate the potential condition of the retina. Many patients with PDR have unclear refractive stroma due to VH and other reasons, so preoperative OCT cannot give a clear diagnosis, so the use of intraoperative OCT can judge whether the patients are complicated with DME and give corresponding treatment. The purpose of this study is to explore the prognosis of patients with DME diagnosed by OCT during PPV and treated with PPV combined with aflibercept or PPV combined with Ozurdex, and to observe and compare the postoperative anatomical results, functional results, times of reinjections and the occurrence of adverse events between the two groups, in order to provide accurate treatment for patients, reduce the frequency of postoperative vitreous injection and lighten the burden of patients.",

One to six participants can be concurrently enrolled onto a dose level, depending on the number of participants enrolled at the current dose level, the number of participants who have experienced a dose/combination limiting toxicity (DLT) at the current dose level, and the number of participants entered but with tolerability data pending. Dose de-escalation will occur if 2 patients at a dose level experience a targeted toxicity. If 6 patients complete a therapy block and experience 0-1 DLT, that dose will be considered the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). New enrollment on an arm (2a/2b) will be paused if further enrollment would result in more than 6 patients being treated on that arm before the RP2D is identified.\n\nThe primary outcome assessment will be a bone marrow with MRD testing on Day 29 of Block 1 therapy. Following that assessment, patients should continue with protocol therapy including either Block 2A (which includes high-dose cytarabine with venetoclax and navitoclax) for patients with CD19 negative leukemia, those with isolated extramedullary relapse, or whose treating physician determines that blinatumomab therapy is not in the patient's best interest; or Block 2B for patients with leukemia which is CD19 positive. Following recovery from Block 2 therapy, all patients except those with late first relapse of B-ALL (\u2265 36 months from diagnosis) who are MRD-negative at \\<0.01% after Block 1 therapy are off therapy.

    "brief_summary": "Friedreich's ataxia is an autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia caused by triplet-repeat expansions. The causative mutation is a trinucleotide (GAA) repeat expansion in the first intron of the frataxin gene, leading to impaired transcription of frataxin. The pathological consequences of frataxin deficiency include a severe disruption of iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, mitochondrial iron overload coupled to cellular iron dysregulation, and an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress.\n\nA hallmark of Friedreich's ataxia is impairment of antioxidative defense mechanisms, which play a major role in disease progression. Studies have demonstrated that nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling is grossly impaired in participants with Friedreich's ataxia. Therefore, the ability of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) to activate Nrf2 and induce antioxidant target genes is hypothesized to be therapeutic in participants with Friedreich's ataxia.\n\nThis 2-part study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) in the treatment of participants with Friedreich's ataxia.\n\nPart 1: The first part of this study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) at various doses in participants with Friedreich's ataxia.\n\nPart 2: The second part of this study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) 150 mg in participants with Friedreich's ataxia. Participants enrolled in Part 2 will be randomized 1:1 to receive omaveloxolone (RTA 408) 150 mg or placebo.\n\nExtension: The extension will assess long-term safety and tolerability of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) in qualified participants with Friedreich's ataxia following completion of Part 1 or Part 2. Participants will not be unblinded to study treatment in Part 1 or Part 2 upon entering the extension study. Participants will receive open-label omaveloxolone (RTA 408) at 150 mg once daily.",

Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of investigational drugs to learn whether the drugs work in treating a specific disease.\"Investigational\" means that the drugs are being studied.\n\nCopanlisib is an IV medication that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma who have received at least two prior therapies. Venetoclax is an oral medication that is approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and certain patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The FDA has not approved copablisib or venetoclax for the treatment of DLBCL or the combination of copanlisib and venetoclax as a treatment for any disease.\n\nIn the phase I portion of this study, the investigators are looking to determine the dose of venetoclax that is safe to give with copanlisib and to see what the side effects are of this combination.\n\nIn the phase II trial, the investigators will be determining how effective venetoclax and copanlisib are for the treatment of R/R DLBCL. Data from laboratory suggest that some subsets of DLBCL are enriched for mutations that make them sensitive to the combination of copanlisib plus venetoclax. This study will look at genetic changes in your cancer and determine if abnormalities in specific genes make these drugs more or less effective.\n\nIt is expected that about 48 people will take part in this research study.\n\nBayer, a pharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by providing the study drug copanlisib and funding for this study.

This study will assess adverse events and effectiveness of BOTOX in adult participants with MMP.\n\nBOTOX is being investigated for the treatment of MMP. Participants are placed in 1 of 2 groups, called treatment arms. Each group receives a different treatment. There is 1 in 4 chance that participants will be assigned to placebo. Around 248 adult participants with MMP will be enrolled in the study at approximately 30 sites in Europe.\n\nParticipants will receive either BOTOX or Placebo administered as 6 intramuscular injections to the masseter on Day 1. Participants who are eligible for retreatment will be given BOTOX on Day 180 and will be followed for up to 6 months.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.",

    "brief_summary": "The proposed study is an open-label, single arm phase II study of venetoclax in combination with rituximab in patients over the age of 60 with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma. The primary objective of the trial is to determine whether the combination of venetoclax with rituximab in this patient population yields a clinically acceptable proportion of overall responses (ORR, assessed by PET/CT with Lugano criteria) without chemotherapy.",
    "detailed_description": "For young, fit patients with mantle cell lymphoma, intensive chemotherapy and rituximab followed by ASCT is often used to achieve prolonged disease free survival. However, this therapy is not curative and has not been shown to improve overall survival. For older or frail patients, who are ineligible for stem cell transplantation, improved disease free survival can be achieved with chemotherapy and rituximab without ASCT, but at the cost of significant short and long-term toxicity. Venetoclax monotherapy has shown impressive single-agent activity in relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma with low rates of adverse events.\n\nThe hypothesis is that initial therapy with venetoclax and rituximab will result in rates of CR and PR that are comparable to historical rates with chemoimmunotherapy. Furthermore, this regimen will have fewer side effects than traditional therapy. Investigators also hypothesize that patients achieving a CR will have long durations of response that will continue after stopping venetoclax.\n\nStudy investigators will test this hypothesis with an open label, single arm phase II trial with a target accrual of 40 participants. This study will include patients over age 60 who are not candidates for aggressive upfront therapy . Subjects will receive venetoclax and rituximab for up to 12 cycles of 4 weeks each. All patients will stop venetoclax after 12 cycles. Participants who have stable disease or disease progression after 4 cycles will be removed from the trial in order to receive standard of care chemoimmunotherapy. Participants who do not achieve a CR after 8 cycles of venetoclax and rituximab will receive 4 cycles of standard of care bendamustine in addition to continuing rituximab and venetoclax.\n\nThis is the first phase II study of venetoclax and rituximab alone as initial therapy for mantle cell lymphoma. In the relapsed and refractory setting, venetoclax has shown high activity in MCL, and as such is a promising option for a non-chemotherapy approach to upfront treatment.",

    "brief_summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, irreversible neurological disorder and is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly population. Clinical symptoms of the disease may begin with occasional forgetfulness such as misplacement of items, forgetting important dates or events, and may progress to noticeable memory loss, increased confusion and agitation, and eventually, loss of independence and non-responsiveness. This study will assess how safe and effective ABBV-916 is in treating early AD. Adverse events, change in disease activity, and how ABBV-916 moves through body of participants will be assessed.\n\nABBV-916 is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of early AD. This study is conducted in 2 stages. Stage A is a multiple ascending dose study. There is a 1 in 4 chance that participants are assigned to receive placebo. Stage B is a proof-of-concept study. In Stage B, there is a 1 in 5 chance that participants will be assigned to receive placebo. The first 6 months of this study are \"double-blind,\" which means that neither the trial participant nor the study doctors know which treatments will be given. This will be followed by a 2-year extension period in which all participants will receive ABBV-916. Approximately 195 participants aged 50-90 years will be enrolled in about 90 sites across the world.\n\nParticipants will receive intravenous (IV) doses of ABBV-916 or placebo once every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 24 weeks and will be followed for an additional 16 weeks. Participants will have the option of participating in a 2-year, open-label, Extension Period receiving IV ABBV-916.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.",

Existing treatment with anti-VEGF agents, although shown to be effective, are limited by short therapeutic half-lives, which then require frequent intravitreal injections over the patient's lifetime, resulting in increased risk of associated adverse events and significant treatment burden.

    "brief_summary": "This phase Ib/II trial evaluates the safety, optimal dose, and efficacy of the combination of epcoritamab and ibrutinib in treating patients with aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or responded to previous treatment (refractory). Epcoritamab, a bispecific antibody, binds to two different types of receptors (proteins present on the cell surface) at the same time. The two receptors that epcoritamab binds to are called CD3 and CD20. CD3 is found on T cells, which are important cells of the immune system that help fight cancer and infections. CD20 is found on the surface of most types of aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells. By binding to both CD3 and CD20, epcoritamab brings the two cells close together so the T cells can fight and kill the lymphoma B cells. Ibrutinib, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, binds to a protein on B cells, a type of white blood cell from which the lymphoma developed. By doing this it decreases the ability of the lymphoma B cells to survive and grow. Ibrutinib may also improve the health (or fitness) of T cells thus making epcoritamab safer and/or more effective.",
    "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and safety of epcoritamab plus ibrutinib.\n\nII. Determine the rate and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the complete response (CR) rate (Lugano 2014) after cycle 12 or the last dose of treatment if stopped earlier.\n\nII. Determine the overall response rate (ORR) (CR + partial response \\[PR\\]) (Lugano 2014), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), and overall survival (OS) of patients treated at the RP2D.\n\nIII. Determine the best ORR and CR rate (Lugano 2014).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Characterize cytokine profile following ibrutinib and epcoritamab and explore whether levels of cytokine production correlate with both the appearance of CRS and ORR.\n\nII. Analyze peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected pre-ibrutinib, pre-epcoritamab, and throughout treatment using spectral flow cytometry to assess the effect of ibrutinib on T-cell numbers and function.\n\nIII. Examine tumor samples attained before starting treatment and at relapse and explore aspects of the microenvironment that may contribute to epcoritamab failure.\n\nIV. Measure circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) to correlate its presence with response by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and track the emergence of treatment-resistant clones.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -7 to 28 of cycle 1 and on days 1 to 28 of remaining cycles, as well as epcoritamab subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of cycles 1-3, days 1 and 15 of cycles 4-9, and on day 1 of remaining cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles of ibrutinib and up to 12 cycles of epcoritamab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Additionally, patients undergo blood sample collection, computed tomography (CT) and PET/CT throughout the study. Patients may also undergo bone marrow aspiration and biopsy on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years then every 6 months for up to 5 years.",

    "detailed_description": "AML is a heterogeneous disease of malignant early myeloid cells with a poor prognosis. Currently the only potentially curative treatment for patients with AML is intensive induction chemotherapy with 7 days of standard-dose cytarabine plus 3 days of an anthracyclin (7+3) followed either by several courses of consolidation chemotherapy with high-dose cytarabine or by allogeneic stem cell transplantation as standard of care (SOC). Complete remission (CR) is achieved in 60-80% of younger patients (aged 16-60 years) and in around 50% of older patients aged \u2265 60 years by this induction chemotherapy. However, this induction chemotherapy is toxic, due to prolonged myelosuppression with resulting infectious complications and organ toxicity with severe nausea, mucositis, colitis and cardiotoxicity. Each cycle of this intensive chemotherapy usually results in prolonged hospitalization of the patients and requires extensive supportive care with blood products and anti-infective agents. In addition, patients treated with intensive induction chemotherapy are at increased risk for several serious long-term side effects including cardiac and neurological sequelae, infertility and secondary cancers. The high toxicity burden in general and cardiovascular toxicity specifically consistently increase total costs in intensive induction and consolidation chemotherapy. From this perspective there is a need for therapies with lower toxicity and better efficacy.\n\nDue to the high risk of early mortality, older patients and those with severe pre-existing conditions are typically treated with non-intensive chemotherapy with either low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) or a hypomethylating agent (HMA) either azacitidine or decitabine.While these treatments offer at best modest efficacy with CR rates of only 10%-30% and median overall survival of 6-12 months, combinations with the B-cell lymphoma-2 inhibitor venetoclax have been shown to produce CR rates between 50-75% in patients not eligible for intensive chemotherapy. The best response of venetoclax-based regimens with response rates up to 93% and two-year overall survival of 75% has been found among others in the large group of AML patients with mutations in the NPM1 gene. Standard intensive treatment in NPM1 mutated AML patients without adverse risk features usually consisting of standard of care chemotherapy plus gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) induces CR rates around 85%, and leads to a 5-year overall survival of around 40% - 50%.The rate and durability of response to venetoclax-based combinations in single arm studies with NPM1 mutated AML patients compared favourably with outcomes from intensive chemotherapy. A retrospective analysis in elderly AML patients with NPM1 mutation found remission rates of 73% in the entire cohort and 96 % in patients \\> 65 years. The venetoclax-based combination with the HMA azacitidine is generally well tolerated and has a better safety profile than intensive chemotherapy.\n\nBased on these available clinical data it is postulated that non-intensive treatment with venetoclax plus azacitidine in NPM1 mutated fit AML patients may be equivalent or superior to the standard intensive treatment in terms of remission rates, relapse-free survival, treatment related mortality and health-related quality of life. This randomised controlled phase II trial (VINCENT) is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the non-intensive treatment with venetolcax and azacitidine (Ven+Aza arm) in a wide age-range of newly diagnosed NPM1 mutated AML patients fit for intensive chemotherapy in comparison to standard of care chemotherapy plus GO (SOC arm).",

Wet AMD is a significant cause of vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan, with up to 2 million people living with wet AMD in these geographies alone. Current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies have significantly changed the landscape for treatment of wet AMD, becoming the standard of care due to their ability to prevent progression of vision loss in the majority of patients. These therapies, however, require life-long intraocular injections, typically repeated every four to 12 weeks in frequency, to maintain efficacy. Due to the burden of treatment, patients often experience a decline in vision with reduced frequency of treatment over time.

In the Induction Period, participants will be randomized into 1 of 3 arms receiving lutikizumab Dose 1, lutikizumab Dose 2, or adalimumab. In the Maintenance Period, participants who responded to lutikizumab will be randomized into 1 of 2 arms of lutikizumab maintenance and participants who responded to adalimumab will continue to receive adalimumab. All participants who did not achieve clinical response per modified Mayo Score at the end of the Induction period will receive open label lutikizumab. Around 200 adult participants with UC will be enrolled at approximately 280 sites worldwide.\n\nDuring the 12 week Induction Period, participants will be randomized to receive intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) lutikizumab or SC adalimumab. At the 12 week mark, participants who are on lutikizumab who have responded to treatment will be re-randomized to receive SC lutikizumab at different intervals until Week 52. Participants who are on adalimumab who are responding to treatment will continue to receive adalimumab. Participants who do not respond to treatment will receive open-label SC lutikizumab. Participants who complete the Week 52 visit and in whom therapeutic benefit to study drug is confirmed by the investigator may roll over into an optional, blinded 52-week long-term extension (LTE).\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.",

The PREEMPT study concluded that BoNT-A could be used as a preventive therapy in chronic migraine patients and FDA approval was obtained. According to the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), BoNT-A is recommended for the management of peripheral neuropathic pain with subcutaneous administration of 50-200 units (50-200U) to onabotulinum toxin A to the painful neuropathic area every 3 months as a third line of treatment. To our knowledge, there are no clinical trials published investigating the effect of intraoral administration of BoNT-A in continuous dentoalveolar neuropathic pain. The aim of this pilot study is to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of intraoral administration of BoNT-A in patients suffering from continuous neuropathic pain.\n\nHYPOTHESIS:\n\nThere will be statistically significant differences in reported pain intensity after the intraoral administration of BOTOX\u00ae in patients suffering from chronic continuous dentoalveolar neuropathic pain.\n\nA single subject experiment will be conducted with 10 patients where 50 U of BonT-A will be injected into the painful dentoalveolar area. Eligible subjects will complete a pain diary indicating their pain intensity by means of a visual analog scale during one month to establish a baseline. After the first injection, subjects will continue to monitor the VAS daily for 3 months and the infiltration will be repeated a second time following the same protocol. Patient's response will be monitored with the daily pain diary.",

This study will also look at the effectiveness of the treatment combination and patient's quality of life while on these medications. Navitoclax is an oral drug that works as an inhibitor of the BCL-2 family of proteins, which are often overly expressed in a wide variety of cancers and are linked to tumor drug resistance. This drug blocks some of the enzymes that keep cancer cells from dying. Venetoclax is an oral drug that works as an inhibitor of BCL-2 proteins that works very similarly to navitoclax by blocking the action of a certain proteins in the body that helps cancer cells survive which helps to kill cancer cells. Decitabine is an intravenous drug. It is a hypomethylating agent which means it interferes with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation. DNA methylation is a major factor that regulates gene expression in cells, and an increase in DNA methylation can block the genes that regulate cell division and growth. When these genes are blocked the overall result allows or promotes cancer as there is no control over cell growth. Decitabine stops cells from making DNA and may kill cancer cells. Participation in this trial may improve the understanding of both chemotherapy response in MDS and mechanisms of resistance to current therapies.",

The 3+3 algorithm will be applied for dose escalation/de-escalation of Venetoclax in combination with Cytarabine. As of February 2023, there have been 2/6 hematologic DLTs in consolidation cohort 1B, therefore we will no longer give Venetoclax in combination with high-dose cytarabine during the consolidation phase, in pts \\>60 yrs of age. We will also not explore dose escalation of Venetoclax during consolidation in the 60-year-old or younger age-group before RP2D of induction is determined. All subjects \u2264 60yrs will be treated at the consolidation Cohort 1A dose.\n\nIn the expansion phase, Venetoclax, at the dose of 200mg daily, will be re-introduced in combination with chemotherapy, albeit at a shorter than a 7-day duration; the consolidation regimen for patients older than 60 years of age will consist of cytarabine at the dose of 0.5-1g/m2 every 12 hours on days 1,3,5 or days 1,2,3 (per ELN 2022 guidelines) plus Venetoclax 200mg for 5 days.\n\nPatients \u2264 60 years\n\nConsolidation cohort 1A:\n\nCytarabine 1.5g/m2 every 12 hours on Days 1, 3, 5 OR days 1, 2, 3; Venetoclax 200mg on Days 1-7\n\nPatients \\>60 years\n\nConsolidation cohort 1B:\n\nCytarabine 0.5-1g/m2 every 12 hours on days 1, 3, 5 OR days 1, 2, 3; Venetoclax 200mg on Days 1-5\n\nA minimum of 3 patients will be treated in each cohort (dose level) sequentially in a 3+3 design. Additional 3 subjects may be backfilled to lower dose levels so that each cohort will reach a total of 6 subjects. Once the MTD is reached, a maximum of 28 additional patients will be randomized 1:1 to the MTD or a dose level below the MTD the starting dose (assuming the MTD is not the starting dose) for a total of up to 20 patients (6 from Part 1, 20 from Part 2) treated at each of those dose levels. A maximum of 52 patients (including backfill and expansion cohorts) 60 years or younger and 46 patients older than 60 years may be enrolled in this Phase 1b study.\n\nPatients will receive one cycle of induction chemotherapy as described above. An interim bone marrow evaluation will be performed between days 14-21 from chemotherapy initiation. Patients who will not achieve marrow hypoplasia (cellularity \\<20% of which less than 5% are residual blasts) will receive a second induction, as allowed by their clinical circumstances. Second induction chemotherapy will be comprised of daunorubicin 60mg/m2 x 2 days (45mg/m2 x 2 days in patients initially treated with daunorubicin 90mg/m2) and cytarabine 100mg/m2 x 5 days along with Venetoclax 400mg for 7 days, whether younger or older than 60 years of age, and disease assessment will be performed on day 28 (up to day 42) of second induction. Patients who do not achieve CR/CRi after a second induction will be taken off protocol and will be treated per treating physician's discretion. Patients who achieve CRc will proceed to consolidation therapy with high-dose cytarabine in combination with escalating doses of Venetoclax (200-400mg) for up to four 28(-42)-day cycles, as described above (complete dose adjustment guidelines are outlined in the study protocol); consolidation with allogeneic transplantation off protocol is allowed per physician's discretion. The 3+3 algorithm will be applied for dose escalation/de-escalation of Venetoclax in combination with high-dose cytarabine. Each cycle of cytarabine will last up to 42 days.\n\nAll participants should undergo response evaluations between Day 28 and Day 42 of first and/or second induction course. Unless there is clear evidence of progressive disease in the blood, bone marrow aspiration is required and bone marrow biopsy is strongly encouraged. In cases with hypocellular marrows (\\<10% cellularity), repeat bone marrow examinations should be considered when there is evidence of hematopoietic recovery. If multiple bone marrow examinations are performed, the last examination will be used to classify the patient's response. The final response will be determined no later than day 42 from the start of therapy.",

Wet AMD is characterized by loss of vision due to new, leaky blood vessel formation in the retina. Wet AMD is a significant cause of vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan, with up to 2 million people living with wet AMD in these geographies alone. Current anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapies have significantly changed the landscape for treatment of wet AMD, becoming the standard of care due to their ability to maintain or prevent progression of vision loss in the majority of patients. These therapies, however, require life-long intraocular injections, typically repeated every 4 to 16 weeks in frequency, to maintain efficacy. Due to the burden of these treatments, patients often experience a decline in vision with reduced frequency of treatment over time.",

The purpose of this study is to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of ABBV-706 as a monotherapy and in combination with budigalimab, carboplatin, or cisplatin.\n\nABBV-706 is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), high-grade central nervous system (CNS) tumors and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). There are multiple treatment arms in this study. Participants will either receive ABBV-706 as a single agent or in combination with budigalimab (another investigational drug), carboplatin or cisplatin at different doses. Approximately 350 adult participants will be enrolled in the study across sites worldwide.\n\nIn part 1 (dose escalation), ABBV-706 will be intravenously infused in escalating doses as a monotherapy until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined in participants with SCLC, high-grade CNS tumors, and high-grade NECs. In part 2, multiple doses will be selected from Part 1 and SCLC participants will be assigned to one of these doses in a randomized fashion to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose. In Part 3a, participants with SCLC or NECs will receive ABBV-706 in combination with budigalimab intravenously every 3 weeks. In Part 3b participants with SCLC or NECs will receive ABBV-706 in combination with either carboplatin or cisplatin intravenously. In Part 4a, participants with CNS tumors will receive ABBV-706 intravenously at a dose determined from Part 1. In Part 4b, participants with NECs will receive ABBV-706 intravenously at a dose selected from Part 1. The estimated duration of the study is up to 3 years.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic and may require frequent medical assessments, blood tests, and scans.",

    "detailed_description": "In the CLL2-BAG-trial, a total of 62 patients of an allcomer CLL population (irrespective of physical fitness, previous therapies and prognostic factors) with an indication for treatment will be included. Patient will receive 2 cycles of debulking treatment with Bendamustine unless contraindications (e.g. refractoriness) are present or a debulking is not indicated due to a low tumor load. Afterwards, 6 cycles of induction treatment with GA101 (obinutuzumab, 3 doses in the first cycle and monthly in cycles 2-6) and ABT-199 (venetoclax, continuously starting in cycle 2 with a low dose escalation) will be applied. The primary endpoint overall response rate will be assessed at final restaging (2 months after end of induction treatment). Patients benefitting from treatment receive further therapy with GA101 (3 monthly) and ABT-199 (continuously) in a maintenance phase for up to 24 months. Maintenance treatment will be stopped in case of achievement of a complete remission and confirmation of MRD (minimal residual disease) negativity in peripheral blood or if unacceptable toxicity or progression occurs.\n\nSince the results of the primary endpoint analysis of the CLL2-BAG trial were very promising and this trial is one of the first studies evaluating the combination of venetoclax and obinutuzumab, it is scientifically very important to follow these first patients treated with this combination as long as possible. Therefore, with amendment 4 and 5, an extended follow-up for all patients willing to continue their study participation was implemented as well as the possibility of a re-treatment with venetoclax and obinutuzumab (but without a prior bendamustine debulking) in case of a progression.",

This study is designed as a basket trial with three separate cohorts. All cohorts include a dose finding portion (Part I) followed by a dose expansion at the Recommended Phase II dose (RP2D, Part II).\n\nThis research study is looking to learn more about how Venetoclax works and aims to determine the safest, highest possible dose that can be combined with standard of care chemotherapies. Because of this, not everyone who participates in this research study may receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose participants receive will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study previously and how well the doses have been tolerated.\n\nStudy procedures include screening for eligibility as well as study treatment visits including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\n* Cohort A: Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myelogenous leukemia arising from MDS (MDS/AML) or treatment-related myeloid neoplasms (tMDS/AML). It is expected that up to 18 people will participate in Part 1 (Dose Determination) and an additional 14-20 people will participate in Part 2 (Dose Expansion) of this cohort.\n* Cohort B: Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myelogenous leukemia arising from MDS (MDS/AML) or treatment-related myeloid neoplasms (tMDS/AML) with an underlying genetic condition that increases their risk of experiencing toxic side effects of chemotherapy. It is expected that up to 18 people will participate in Part 1 (Dose Determination) and an additional 6 people will participate in Part 2 (Dose Expansion) of this cohort.\n* Cohort C: Patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL). It is expected that up to 18 people will participate in Part 1 (Dose Determination) and an additional 12 people will participate in Part 2 (Dose Expansion) of this cohort.\n\nThis research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further studies. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Venetoclax for use in children. However, Venetoclax is FDA-approved as a treatment for certain types of leukemia in adults. It is actively being studied in children and adults with other types of cancer. Information from these research studies has suggested that venetoclax may also be effective in treating participants with MDS or leukemia, including MDS or leukemia that did not respond to standard treatment or that has come back after standard treatment. The survival of cancer cells is controlled by proteins within the cancer cell. One of these proteins is called BCL-2. The study drug, venetoclax, blocks this protein and is thought to reduce cell survival in some cancer cells.",

This study will assess how safe and effective upadacitinib is in treating adult participants with moderately to severely active SLE. Adverse events and change in the disease activity will be assessed.\n\nUpadacitinib is an approved drug for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and axial spondylarthritis and is being developed for the treatment of SLE. This study is \"double-blinded\", which means that neither the trial participants nor the study doctors will know who will be given upadacitinib and who will be given placebo (does not contain treatment drug) . This study comprised of 4 sub studies. In Study 1 and Study 2, study doctors put the participants in 1 of the 2 groups, called treatment arms. Each group receives a different treatment. There is a 1 in 2 chance that participants will be assigned to placebo. Eligible participants from Study 1 and Study 2 will enter Study 3 at week 52 to receive specific doses of upadacitinib. Study 4 is a 104-week continued extension if participation is likely to provide a benefit to their SLE. Approximately 500 participants diagnosed with SLE will be enrolled in each of the Study 1 and Study 2 in approximately 320 sites across the world.\n\nParticipants will receive oral tablets of upadacitinib or matching placebo once daily for 52 weeks in Study 1 and Study 2. Eligible participants from Study 1 and Study 2 will receive oral tablets of upadacitinib once daily for 52 weeks in Study 3.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.",

This study will assess adverse events and effectiveness of BOTOX in adult participants with MMP.\n\nBOTOX is being investigated for the treatment of MMP. Participants are placed in 1 of 4 groups, called treatment arms. Each group receives a different treatment. There is 1 in 5 chance that participants will be assigned to placebo. Around 250 adult participants with MMP will be enrolled in the study at approximately 20 sites in Japan.\n\nParticipants will receive either BOTOX or Placebo administered as 6 intramuscular injections to each masseter muscle on Day 1.

In this regard, the observation in the phase II clinical trial conducted by us (Laboratory for Investigative Dermatology at the Rockefeller University) was groundbreaking that just a single dose of anti-IL-23p19 antibody (risankizumab, trade name: Skyrizi, study drug in this clinical trial) administration produced disease clearance up to 66 weeks in 46% (6 of 13) of patients. However, there is a lack of understanding about immune regulation in human skin induced by anti-IL-23p19 antibody injection, and there is a need to conduct a psoriasis clinical trial for single-cell sequencing immune cells in human psoriasis skin before and after anti-IL-23p19 antibody administration, and to correlate regulatory immune cell alterations with clinical disease progression. The overall objective of the clinical trial is to study regulatory immune cell alterations induced by anti-IL-23p19 antibody administration in psoriasis patients who achieve long-term disease clearance off drugs.",
    "detailed_description": "Although the newly developed biologics targeting IL-23/Th17 axis are highly effective in controlling psoriasis, all the biologics should be continuously injected to suppress recurrence of the disease. In this regard, the observation in our phase I psoriasis clinical trial was groundbreaking that just a single dose of anti-IL-23p19 antibody administration produced disease clearance up to 66 weeks in 46% (6 of 13) of patients. Since FoxP3 mRNA levels remained high in posttreatment biopsy specimens of these patients, we hypothesized that IL-23p19 inhibition increased regulatory T-cell levels or function in resolved psoriatic skin. However, there is a lack of understanding about regulatory immune cell promotion by IL-23p19 inhibition in human skin.\n\nOur overall objectives of the study, are to (i) identify regulatory immune cell alterations induced by anti-IL-23p19 antibody administration in the skin of patients whose psoriasis is cleared without recurrence and (ii) develop pre-treatment predictive models for psoriasis patients that anticipate disease clearance and recurrence after short-term anti-IL-23p19 antibody injection. The rationale for this project is that molecular evidence of immune tolerance induction by IL-23p19 inhibition in human skin is likely to offer a strong clinical framework whereby new strategies to prevent recurrence of chronic inflammatory diseases can be developed. In this study, subjects with moderate-to-severe psoriasis will receive FDA-approved anti-IL-23p19 antibody (Generic name: Risankizumab, Product name: SKYRIZI\u2122 or risankizumab-rzaa) up to 4 months following the FDA-approved indications, usage, dosage, and administration in the FDA-approved dosage forms and strengths through week 16, after which, dosing stops.",

In addition, WM patients are often elderly, partly not tolerating chemotherapy related toxicities. Thus, innovative approaches are needed which combine excellent activity and tolerability in WM. Chemotherapy-free approaches are highly attractive for this patient group. Based on its high activity and favorable toxicity profile in indolent B-NHL such as CLL, Venetoclax was approved for the treatment of this diseases by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). First data in relapsed/refractory WM have documented high activity and low toxicity of Venetoclax also in WM, including patients with prior Ibrutinib treatment or patients carrying CXCR4 mutations. Ibrutinib itself has high activity and a relatively low toxicity profile in WM, but has also major disadvantages: the main disadvantage is the need to apply this drug continuously. Furthermore, Ibrutinib efficacy depends largely on the genotype with a substantial drop in major responses and PFS in the presence of CXCR4 mutations and non-mutated MYD88. In particular the need of continuous treatment for Ibrutinib has prevented that Ibrutinib has become the standard of care outcompeting conventional Rituximab/chemotherapy. This is reflected in current guidelines such as the NCCN and the ESMO guidelines, which still see immunochemotherapy as a backbone of treatment, largely because of the advantage of a timely fixed application. Data in CLL in the relapsed as well as in the first line setting have convincingly shown that in contrast to Ibrutinib Venetoclax is highly efficient also when used in a timely defined application scheme over 12 months in combination with the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab. Data documented deep responses including molecular responses and a highly significant advantage over immunochemotherapy in large international Phase III trials, changing the standard of care in this disease.\n\nBased on this the hypothesis is that timely fixed application of the combination of Venetoclax and Rituximab induces significantly superior treatment outcomes compared to chemotherapy and Rituximab (DRC) in patients with treatment na\u00efve WM, regardless of the genotype. A first indication for this assumption in the proposed trial will allow the performance of confirmatory phase 3 trials that might change the standard of care in WM.",

Furthermore, Ibrutinib efficacy depends largely on the genotype with a substantial drop in major responses and PFS in the presence of CXCR4 mutations and non-mutated MYD88. In particular the need of continuous treatment for Ibrutinib has prevented that Ibrutinib has become the standard of care outcompeting conventional Rituximab/chemotherapy. This is reflected in current guidelines such as the NCCN and the ESMO guidelines, which still see immunochemotherapy as a backbone of treatment, largely because of the advantage of a timely fixed application. Data in CLL in the relapsed as well as in the first line setting have convincingly shown that in contrast to Ibrutinib Venetoclax is highly efficient also when used in a timely defined application scheme over 12 months in combination with the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab. Data documented deep responses including molecular responses and a highly significant advantage over immunochemotherapy in large international Phase III trials, changing the standard of care in this disease.\n\nBased on this the hypothesis is that timely fixed application of the combination of Venetoclax and Rituximab induces significantly superior treatment outcomes compared to chemotherapy and Rituximab (DRC) in patients with treatment na\u00efve WM, regardless of the genotype. A first indication for this assumption in the proposed trial will allow the performance of confirmatory phase 3 trials that might change the standard of care in WM.\n\nThis study is an International phase II explorative, multicenter, open label, and randomized trial.\n\nThe study will consist of an open labeled, stratified 1:1 randomization between Arm A and Arm B for de novo WM patients in need of treatment (phase II). Stratification factors are MYD88 and CXCR4 status (positive vs. negative). A stratified central block randomization will be used. The central randomization service will be used to avoid predictability of the treatment arm.\n\nThe primary goal of this study is to explore the efficacy of Venetoclax plus Rituximab versus Dexamethasone/Cyclophosphamide/Rituximab in the treatment of de novo WM patients (Arm A vs. Arm B).\n\n80 patients are planned to be recruited for this study at approcimately 30 sites in Germany, Greece and France.",

    "detailed_description": "Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is approved by the FDA for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) previously treated with a taxane and trastuzumab, and is currently listed as the preferred second-line therapy in the NCCN guidelines (NCCN 2014). While the benefit of continued HER2 inhibition has been conclusively established for disease that has progressed on a trastuzumab-containing regimen, there are currently no data regarding the efficacy of HER2- targeted therapies following progression on T-DM1.\n\nWith the population of T-DM1-treated patients steadily growing, clinical trials are needed to investigate novel therapies in this setting,to meet the medical need for effective, evidence-based therapies for these patients.\n\nThe oral small-molecule Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib has also demonstrated the ability to inhibit erythroblastosis virus oncogene B (ErbB)/HER receptor family kinases in preclinical studies at clinically relevant concentrations, with an equivalent or greater potency than other HER2-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with demonstrated activity in HER2-positive MBC, including lapatinib, neratinib, and afatinib. Of note, in preclinical HER2-positive cell model systems the growth inhibitory ability of ibrutinib was substantially greater in HER2-amplified breast cancer cells versus those that simply overexpressed the HER2 protein.\n\nIbrutinib is currently approved for use in patients with Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and has an established safety record from clinical trials in these patient populations. Thus there is a reasonable rationale to investigate ibrutinib in patients with HER2- amplified MBC, in the setting of T-DM1-pretreated disease. Previous studies have demonstrated that combined targeting of HER2 with multiple HER2-directed agents is more effective that single agent therapy and therefore this study will explore the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib in combination with trastuzumab.\n\nThis is a Phase I/II, open-label, unblinded, nonrandomized, standard 3+3 dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of ibrutinib (560 or 840 or 420 mg QD) given orally in combination with trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg q3w) administered intravenously (IV) in patients with HER2-amplified MBC that has progressed on prior therapy with ado-trastuzumab emtansine.\n\nOnce the recommended phase II dose of ibrutinib plus trastuzumab has been determined (no more than 1 of 6 patients with dose-limiting toxicity) in the required 6 to 18 patients over the 3 possible dose levels, additional patients will be enrolled on the phase II part of the study at the recommended phase II dose of ibrutinib plus trastuzumab, for a maximum of 51 patients total.",

    "brief_summary": "Introduction and rationale:\n\nParkinson\u00b4s disease (PD) is a slowly progressive and chronic disease, characterized by a range of motor and non-motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, tremor and falls, but also sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, behavioral problems and autonomic failure. These symptoms often fluctuate over time and between patients. These fluctuating and often debilitating symptoms necessitate proper monitoring. Due to this complexity, most patients require long-term specialized care. The current prevalence of PD in the Netherlands is estimated at 600-775 per 100.000 persons. This figure is expected to increase with \\> 50% in 2040. Combined with rising healthcare costs and a projected reduction in the number of available healthcare professionals, a system of frequent outpatient visits with a movement disorder specialist, as is currently the standard of care for PD in most (Dutch) hospitals, will likely not be sustainable.\n\nAdditionally, improvements can be made in the quality of care for PD-patients. The most important aspect mentioned by patients is improved self-management. Other points of improvement are: communication between different healthcare professionals involved; advanced care planning and having a single point of access / personal case manager. Recently an international group of experts in the field of PD have published a viewpoint article concerning their ideas for the optimization of the care for PD-patients. In addition to the previous points, these experts mention: providing care at home rather than in hospital; pro-active instead of reactive care and improvement of the expertise of healthcare professionals.\n\nA possible solution to improving the sustainability of care for PD-patients, and addressing several of the issues concerning quality of care, lies in the use of telemedicine (or eHealth): the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients by means of telecommunications technology. Telemedicine exists in a wide variety of forms, one of which is 'telemonitoring'; the home monitoring of patients. In 2017 it was shown that telemonitoring is save and led to a significant reduction in health care consumption in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, studies in several chronic diseases have shown that telemonitoring leads to better patient empowerment and improved self-management. Self-management is in itself associated with improved health status and well-being in patients with a chronic disease as well as with a reduction in healthcare consumption.\n\nIn collaboration with Sananet, Zuyderland Medical Center has developed a telemonitoring tool for PD called 'SanaCoach Parkinson' (SCP). It is, to the investigators knowledge, the first telemonitoring tool for PD that uses anamnestic data from targeted questionnaires to monitor patients with PD. Trough the SCP both motor and non-motor aspects of PD are screened pro-actively. It allows patients to remain at home rather that visit the outpatient clinic. Additionally, proactive monitoring of symptoms leads to earlier detection of deterioration. This gives the neurologist the possibility to optimize (medical) treatment before further, costly, complications arise. Furthermore, the SCP improves patients' insight in their disease, supporting self-management.\n\nA previous pilot-study into the effect of implementation of this tool showed that the use of the SCP was feasible in an outpatient care setting and that patient satisfaction and experienced quality of care were high. Additionally, the use of the SCP led to a significant reduction in the number of outpatient visits as well as the PD-related healthcare costs in Zuyderland Medical Center in the first year of use of the SCP.\n\nHypotheses:\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that implementation of telemonitoring via the SCP will be non-inferior to treatment as usual (TAU) with regards to the quality of care as experienced by PD-patients, while reducing the PD-related healthcare consumption and costs.\n\nSecondly the investigators hypothesize that telemonitoring via the SCP will improve the quality of care for PD-patients compared to TAU.\n\nStudy Design and procedures:\n\nThis will be a non-randomized, prospective, multi-center, non-inferiority, implementation study. During 1 year, all consecutive PD-patients in the neurology outpatient clinic of each participating hospital that meet the in- and exclusion criteria will be invited to join this study. Participants will be monitored via the SCP for 2 years. During this time, PD-related outpatient visits with either a neurologist of specialized nurse will be set at 1-2 per patient per year, with a maximum total planned duration of 60 minutes. If this is not feasible, the primary reason for this will be recorded.\n\nNew hospitals may join the study until 6 months after the inclusion of the first patient.\n\nAssessments will take place at baseline, 1 year and 2 years.",

This study will assess adverse events and change in disease activity with linaclotide therapy in participants with FC.\n\nLinaclotide is an approved drug being developed for the treatment of FC in pediatric patients, ages 2 to 5, who meet modified Rome IV criteria for childhood FC. In Part 1 of this study, participants are placed in 1 of 2 groups, called treatment arms. Each group receives a different treatment. There is a 1 in 2 chance that participants will be assigned to placebo. All participants in Part 2 will receive linaclotide. Approximately 116 participants aged 2 to 5 years with FC will be enrolled in this study at around 45 sites worldwide.\n\nParticipants will receive daily doses of oral Linaclotide capsules or matching placebo for 12 weeks in Part 1 of the study. In Part 2, the open label long-term safety extension, participants with FC who completed study intervention in Part 1 of Study M21-572 or the Phase 2 Study LIN-MD-67 will receive linaclotide for 24 weeks.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care (due to study procedures). Participants will attend visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.",

    "detailed_description": "In acute hospitalized severe, steroid refractory UC, only two medical rescue therapies have been found efficacious in controlled trials and recommended in management, infliximab and cyclosporine. Due to toxicity and nuance in using cyclosporine, infliximab is by far the most commonly used medical rescue therapy in this setting. There is emerging retrospective and prospective case series data suggesting JAK inhibitors, such as tofacitinib or upadacitinib, could also be used for this patient population. JAK inhibitors offer potential advantages including convenience of oral therapy, efficacy independent of serum albumin levels, and no concern for immunogenicity as is seen with anti-TNFs. They also offer a short half-life and are eliminated by humans within 48 hours of the last dose administered. This could be beneficial, as it may offer a chance to use a JAK inhibitor first and switch to infliximab in patients who do not respond to a JAK inhibitor, as theoretically cumulative immunosuppression should not be as high transitioning from a JAK inhibitor to infliximab, as compared to using JAK inhibitor after infliximab failure since there will still be lots of infliximab present owing to its long half-life. It is unclear how JAK inhibitors compare to our standard of care and where they should be positioned in acute severe UC. This study aims to examine patients with acute severe UC who are refractory to intravenous corticosteroids and determine whether a strategy of using upadacitinib first followed by infliximab in upadacitinib non-responders is non-inferior to conventional management with infliximab only.",

    "brief_summary": "This research study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of administering venetoclax and inotuzumab ozogamicin in combination in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)\n\nThe names of the study drugs involved in this study are:\n\n* Venetoclax\n* Inotuzumab ozogamicin\n* Dexamethasone",
    "detailed_description": "This is a phase I study of venetoclax in combination with inotuzumab ozogamicin for the treatment of CD22-positive (CD22+) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and lymphoma (B-LBL), hereafter referred to as \"ALL,\" in patients with disease relapsed from or refractory (R/R) to prior intensive chemotherapy.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved venetoclax for ALL but it has been approved for other uses. Venetoclax is an oral (pill) chemotherapy that works by blocking the action of certain proteins in cancer cells that help those cells survive.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved inotuzumab ozogamicin as a treatment option for ALL but not in combination with other drugs. Inotuzumab ozogamicin is an antibody-drug conjugate. An antibody-drug conjugate is a medication where a cancer drug (chemotherapy) is attached to an antibody, an immune system protein, that targets a specific protein on the cancer cell. Inotuzumab ozogamicin is combination of an antibody that targets the CD22 protein on ALL cells and calicheamicin, a chemotherapy compound that kills cancer cells. Once the antibody portion of inotuzumab ozogamicin binds to CD22 protein on cancer cells, the calicheamicin is released into the cell, where it damages the cancer cell's DNA and causes its death.\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment for approximately 6-9 months depending on their response to the study treatment and followed for two years after completion of study.\n\nIt is expected that 20 to 32 people will take part in this research study.\n\nAbbvie is supporting this research study by providing the study drug venetoclax and funding research tests and procedures.",

    "detailed_description": "Therefore, the investigators designed a prospective, multicentre, study of the clinical course, anatomical progression and treatment of newly diagnosed CD and plan to include 600 patients over a 2-year period. Patients will be followed over 5 years after diagnosis (the date of diagnosis will be the date of the index histopathology describing CD; in special situations where pathology is not available the date of diagnosis will be the date that CD was declared by the physician). A morphological evaluation (LI), using abdominal magnetic resonance, will be performed at 1, 3 and 5 years after diagnosis. Ileocolonoscopy, upper endoscopy and/or pelvic MRI will be included according to disease location. Patients will be treated with standard of care therapy and will be followed for 5 years after diagnosis, with semestrial visits after the Year 1 (LI 1). At each visit, clinical and laboratory markers will be collected. Perianal and abdominal surgeries during follow-up will be registered. The disability index questionnaire will also be recorded every year.\n\nA preliminary requisite is therefore to implement and standardize examination reports and damage definitions used to calculate the LI. To this end, training session, supervised by members of the steering committee, will be held for participating gastroenterologist and radiologists. Based on commented ileocolonoscopy, upper endoscopy abdominal MRI and pelvic MRI, these sessions will highlight how lesions should be characterized and graded accordingly to implement the L\u00e9mann Index.",
