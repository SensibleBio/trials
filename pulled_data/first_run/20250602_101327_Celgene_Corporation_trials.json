Specifically, the objective of this trial is to determine if, in the era of novel drugs, high dose therapy (HDT) is still necessary in the initial management of multiple myeloma in younger patients. In this study, HDT as compared to conventional dose treatment would be considered superior if it significantly prolongs progression-free survival by at least 9 months or more, recognizing that particular subgroups may benefit more compared to others.",
    "detailed_description": "The drugs, lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone, are approved by the FDA. They have not been approved in the combination for multiple myeloma or any other type of cancer. Bortezomib is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide is approved for use with dexamethasone for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy and for the treatment of certain types of myelodysplastic syndrome (another type of cancer affecting the blood). Dexamethasone is commonly used, either alone, or in combination with other drugs, to treat multiple myeloma. Please note that Bortezomib and Lenalidomide are provided to patients participating in this trial at no charge. Melphalan and cyclophosphamide, the drugs used during stem cell collection and transplant, are also approved by the FDA. Melphalan is an FDA-approved chemotherapy for multiple myeloma and is used as a high-dose conditioning treatment prior to stem cell transplantation. Cyclophosphamide is used, either alone, or in combination with other drugs, to treat multiple myeloma. These drugs have been used in other multiple myeloma studies and information from those studies suggests that this combination of therapy may help to treat newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.\n\nAfter screening procedures determine if a patient is eligible for this research study, the patient will be randomized into one of the study groups: lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone without autologous stem cell transplantation, followed by lenalidomide maintenance (Arm A) or lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone with autologous stem cell transplantation, followed by lenalidomide maintenance (Arm B). There is an equal chance of being placed in either group. Randomization was stratified by International Staging System (ISS) disease stage (I, II, or III) and cytogenetics (high-risk \\[presence of 17p deletion, t(4;14), or t(14;16) on fluorescence in-situ hybridization\\], standard-risk \\[absence of high-risk abnormalities\\], or undetermined \\[test failure\\]) assessed locally in a screening bone marrow sample, with positivity cut-offs per institutional standards.",

    "detailed_description": "Especially for diseases that are not curable such as metastatic breast cancer (MBC), the maintenance of quality of life is one of the main aims of treatments. Adverse events are well-known side effects of any cytostatic treatment and impact the patients' quality of life. Therefore, new treatment options are developed that should stop or at least slow down metastatic spread of cancer without causing negative side effects in terms of high-grade adverse events. For patients with hormone-receptor positive and HER2 positive MBC the combination of HER2-targeted therapy with endocrine therapy has already been proven to be an effective and in many cases valuable alternative to the combination of HER2-targeted therapy with chemotherapy. The high relevance of HER2-neu-targeted/endocrine treatment combinations derives from the fact that potential chemotherapy-related toxicity can be avoided, which in turn positively affects quality of life. Clinical trials suggest an additional benefit when a CDK4/6 inhibitor is added to the combination of endocrine therapy and anti HER2 treatment. DETECT V is a randomized phase III study comparing the safety and efficacy of trastuzumab plus pertuzumab and the CDK 4/6 inhibitor ribociclib in combination with either endocrine therapy or chemotherapy.",

The CACTUX regimen is a combination of three drugs called cisplatin, nab-paclitaxel, and cetuximab (although carboplatin may be given in place of cisplatin if participants have previously had problems receiving cisplatin). The use of nab-paclitaxel in this combination is different from routine care, in which a drug called 5FU is often given instead, but the investigators group has conducted previous research where the investigators incorporated nab-paclitaxel into routine treatment with cisplatin, 5FU, and cetuximab. The investigators are looking at the incidence of side effects with the CACTUX regimen as well as response of the disease and health status.",

We are looking for the highest dose of the combination that can be given safely and see how well it works as a combination in newly diagnosed patients.",
    "detailed_description": "* The safe dose of dexamethasone is already known. The dose of bortezomib and lenalidomide will be increased during the study until the best and safest amount (or dose) is identified. The participant's dose of the study drugs will depend on when they enter the study.\n* In this study each cycle will be 21 days and participants will begin the study medication in the clinic on Cycle 1 Day 1. Lenalidomide (capsules) will be taken daily for the first 2 weeks only (Day 1-14). Dexamethasone (tablets) will be taken on Day 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 12. Bortezomib will be given intravenously in the outpatient treatment clinic on Day 1, 4, 8 and 11. The third week is a rest period and no study medication will be given.\n* During the course of the study treatment, tests and procedures will be performed at designated time periods. This includes; medical history updates, physical/neurological examinations, skeletal survey (x-rays or scan), blood samples, optional bone marrow aspiration/tissue biopsy, urine samples, 12-lead ECG, and MRI/CT scan (if needed).\n* It is expected that study participants will receive study treatment for 8 cycles (168 days). If the participant completes the first 8 cycles of the study, has stable or responding disease and has not experienced bad side effects, they will be allowed to continue treatment on a maintenance schedule, detailed in the protocol, at the study doctor's discretion.",

Researchers also want to learn the highest tolerable dose of romidepsin that can be given with this combination.\n\nThe safety of this combination and the safety of giving romidepsin after a stem cell transplant will also be studied.\n\nThis is an investigational study. Romidepsin is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of CTCL in patients who have received at least 1 systemic (affecting the whole body) therapy before. Busulfan and fludarabine are FDA approved and commercially available for use with a stem cell transplant.\n\nThe use of the combination of romidepsin, busulfan, and fludarabine to treat the type of leukemia or lymphoma you have is considered investigational.\n\nUp to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.",
    "detailed_description": "Study Parts and Study Drug Dose Levels:\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will start Part 1 of the study. During Part 1, you will receive the study drugs before having a stem cell transplant. If the disease is well controlled after the transplant and you are still eligible, you will start Part 2. During Part 2, you will continue to receive romidepsin. The study treatments given in each part are described in more detail below.\n\nThe dose of romidepsin you receive will depend on when you join this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of romidepsin is found.\n\nAll participants will receive the same dose level of fludarabine. Busulfan dose levels are explained below.\n\nStudy Drug Administration and Transplant (Part 1):\n\nThe days before you receive the stem cell transplant are called minus days. The day you receive the stem cell transplant is called Day 0. The days after you receive the stem cell transplant are called plus days.\n\nOn Days -13 and -12, you will receive busulfan by vein over 3 hours. Blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will then be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing up to 11 times over the 11 hours after the first busulfan dose. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. The study staff will tell you more about the PK testing schedule. The test results will help the doctor decide what dose of busulfan you will receive during the study.\n\nA heparin lock line will be placed in your vein before the PK testing to lower the number of needle sticks needed for these draws. If for any reason it is not possible for the PK tests to be performed, you will receive the standard dose of busulfan.\n\nOn Day -7, you will be admitted to the hospital.\n\nOn Day -6 through -3, you will receive romidepsin by vein over 4 hours, fludarabine by vein over 1 hour, and then busulfan by vein over 3 hours. PK testing up to 11 times over 11 hours will also be performed on Day -6 if the doctor thinks it is needed.\n\nIf you are going to be receiving a transplant from a matched unrelated donor, you will also receive antithymocyte globulin (ATG) by vein over 4 hours on the 3 days before the transplant. This drug is designed to further weaken your immune system to reduce the risk of rejecting of the transplant.\n\nBeginning on Day -2, you will receive tacrolimus by vein over 24 hours every day until you are able to take it by mouth. Tacrolimus is designed to weaken the immune system and lower the risk of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD - a reaction of the donor's immune cells against your body). Once you are able to take tacrolimus by mouth, you will take it every day for about 3 months, or until the doctor thinks it is safe to stop taking.\n\nOn Day 0, you will receive the donor's stem cells by vein. The infusion will last anywhere from about 30 minutes to several hours.\n\nOn Days +1, +3, +6, and +11, you will receive methotrexate by vein over about 15 minutes. Methotrexate is also designed to weaken the immune system and lower the risk of GVHD.\n\nIf the doctor thinks it is needed, you will be given other standard drugs to help lower the risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for more information about how the drugs are given and their risks.\n\nRomidepsin Maintenance Therapy (Part 2):\n\nStarting between Day +28 and Day +100, if you are eligible for Part 2 based on the disease status, you will continue to receive romidepsin by vein over 1 hour once or twice a month. You may receive the doses at MD Anderson or at an oncologist's office close to where you live. The study doctor will discuss this with you.\n\nStudy Visits:\n\nAs a baseline test at the beginning of the study (within 7 days before starting romidepsin), blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for comparison purposes to learn if and how romidepsin may affect the disease and your immune system. If a bone marrow aspirate will be performed at this time, additional bone marrow aspirate will be collected for testing to see how romidepsin may have affected the disease and your immune system.\n\nYou will remain in the hospital for as long as the doctor thinks is needed.\n\nWhenever your doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 tablespoons) and/or urine will be collected for routine tests.\n\nAbout \u00bd-1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the transplant:\n\n* You will have a physical exam.\n* Blood (about 8 tablespoons) will be drawn to see how well the transplant has taken and to learn if and how romidepsin may have affected the disease and your immune system.\n* If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease. To collect a bone marrow aspirate, an area of the hip or other site is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle. Additional bone marrow aspirate will be collected for testing to see how romidepsin may have affected the disease and your immune system.\n\nThe above tests/procedures may be performed sooner, if your doctor thinks they are needed. You may also have additional tests if your doctor thinks they are needed.\n\nBefore your first dose of romidepsin in Parts 1 and 2:\n\n* You will have an electrocardiogram (EKG) to check your heart function.\n* Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to learn if and how romidepsin may have affected the disease and your immune system. Part of this blood sample will be used for a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant.\n\nIf you are in Part 2, every 2 weeks (before each dose of romidepsin), blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Part of this blood sample will be used for a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant. This may be repeated more often, if your doctor thinks it is needed.\n\nIf you are in Part 2, once a month:\n\n* You will have an EKG.\n* You will have a physical exam.\n\nPart 2 participants may have the blood tests done before each romidepsin dose and monthly EKGs and physical exams performed either at MD Anderson or your local oncologist's office. If they are performed locally, the results should be sent to the study staff. You will need to return to MD Anderson to have tests and procedures performed at 3, 6, and 12 months after the transplant.\n\nLength of Study:\n\nYou may receive up to 4 doses of romidepsin in Part 1. You may also receive chemotherapy on certain days between Day -13 and Day -3, and the stem cell transplant on Day 0. In Part 2, you may receive up to 24 cycles of romidepsin maintenance therapy as part of the study.\n\nYour participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits. After 1 year, you will have routine follow-up with your transplant doctor.\n\nYou may be taken off study early if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, if the disease gets worse or comes back, if intolerable side effects occur, if you have graft failure (the transplanted cells do not grow), or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\nIf for any reason you want to leave the study early, you must talk to the study doctor. It may be life-threatening to leave the study after you have started to receive the study drugs but before you receive the stem cell transplant because your blood cell counts will be dangerously low.",

    "detailed_description": "Study Drug Administration:\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will begin taking the study drugs in 28-day cycles. One time a week during Cycle 1, you will receive rituximab by vein. During Cycle 2, you will not receive rituximab. During Cycles 3-12, you will receive rituximab on Day 1 of Cycles 3-12. Your first dose of rituximab will be given over 6-8 hours. If you tolerate your first dose well, you may receive the next doses over 2-4 hours. If the doctor thinks it is needed, the next doses may given over a longer time.\n\nStarting on Day 9 of Cycle 1, you will begin taking lenalidomide by mouth 1 time a day.\n\nThe dose and schedule of lenalidomide may change depending on the side effects you may have. You should swallow lenalidomide capsules whole with a glass (8 ounces) water at the same time each day. Do not break, chew, or open the capsules. If you miss a dose of lenalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the same day. If you miss a dose, it should NOT be made up on another day.\n\nDuring Cycle 1 only, you will take allopurinol by mouth 1 time a day on Days 1-14 to lower the risk of side effects.\n\nStudy Visits:\n\nOne (1) time a week during the first 5 weeks, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\nAfter the first 5 weeks, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests every 2 weeks until the doctor thinks your dose of lenalidomide can stay the same. After that, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn every 4 weeks for the rest of the study for routine tests.\n\nAt the end of Cycles 3, 6, and 12, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration to check the status of the disease.\n\nIf you stay on study past 12 cycles, once every 6 cycles (Cycles 18, 24, 30, and so on), you will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration to check the status of the disease.\n\nBlood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn more often if the dose of lenalidomide needs to be changed or if you have intolerable side effects.\n\nPregnancy Testing:\n\nIf you are able to become pregnant, you will have a urine or blood (less than 1 teaspoon) pregnancy test 10-14 days and 24 hours before the first dose of lenalidomide, even if you have not had a menstrual period due to treatment of the disease or had only 1 menstrual period in the past 24 months.\n\nIf you have regular or no menstrual cycles, you will then have a urine or blood (less than 1 teaspoon) pregnancy test every week for the first 4 weeks, then every 4 weeks while taking lenalidomide, again as soon as you stop taking lenalidomide, and then 28 days after you have stopped taking lenalidomide.\n\nIf you have irregular menstrual cycles, you will have a urine or blood (less than 1 teaspoon) pregnancy test every week for the first 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks while taking lenalidomide, again as soon as you stop taking lenalidomide, and then at 14 days and 28 days after you have stopped taking lenalidomide.\n\nLength of Treatment:\n\nYou may receive rituximab for up to 12 cycles.
