    "detailed_description": "This research study evaluates the feasibility and tolerability of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational intervention to use for further studies. \"Investigational\" means that the intervention is being studied and that research doctors are trying to find more about it. It also means that the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the Personalized Neoantigen Cancer Vaccine for any use in patients, including people with CLL.\n\nThis is the first time NeoVax vaccine will be given in combination with cyclophosphamide and Pembrolizumab in humans.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine if it is possible to make and safely administer a vaccine against CLL. The investigators plan to analyze the specific genetic characteristics (mutations) of the participant's own CLL and use that information to produce proteins that may help the immune system recognize and fight CLL cells.\n\nThis vaccine is also being tested in clinical trials in patients with advanced melanoma (a type of skin cancer) or glioblastoma (a type of brain cancer). The current study will examine the ability of the vaccine to stimulate the immune system when given at several different timepoints, and will examine the participant blood cells for signs that the CLL has changed or decreased.\n\nCLL cells will be obtained from bone marrow biopsy and blood draws. The genetic material contained in the CLL cells will be examined for the presence of tumor-specific mutations. This information will be used to prepare small protein fragments, which are called \"peptides.\" The vaccine will consist of up to 20 of these peptides as well as a drug called Poly-ICLC. A peptide from the tetanus vaccine may also be included to boost the immune response. A third of the patients enrolled in this trial will receive the personalized neoantigen vaccine. Another third of the patients will also receive low doses of a chemotherapy drug called cyclophosphamide in combination of personalized neoantigen vaccine. The last third of patients enrolled in this study will receive the personalized neoantigen vaccine in combination with low dose cyclophosphamide and a drug called Pembrolizumab.\n\nPoly-ICLC (also called Hiltonol) is an experimental \"viral mimic\" and an activator of immunity. Poly-ICLC binds proteins on the surface of certain immune cells to make it appear as if a virus is present. When the cells detect the vaccine, they think it is a virus and turn on the immune system. Poly-ICLC will be mixed with NeoAntigen peptides and administered as an injection given underneath the skin. Poly-ICLC is an investigational drug, meaning the FDA has not approved it as a treatment for any disease.\n\nCyclophosphamide (also called Cytoxan) is a chemotherapy drug used to treat many cancers, including CLL. At the much lower dose used in this study, it is an investigational drug to help the immune cells to be better at attacking cancer cells.\n\nPembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat other types of cancer and information from these studies suggests that it may be beneficial in CLL.",

Patients will receive either BNT314 alone or BNT314 combined with pembrolizumab.\n\nPhase 1 of the study consists of a dose escalation part, and a safety run-in (SRI) and expansion part:\n\nDose escalation: In this part of the study, patients will be assigned to multiple dose levels (DLs) of BNT314 given alone. By escalating the dose with a small group of patients, the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) which is the highest dose with acceptable safety and manageable side effects, or the maximum administered dose (MAD) will be investigated. At the end of this part, the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) which is the dose to be tested in Phase 2 will be decided.\n\nSafety Run-In: In this part of the study, BNT314 will be combined with pembrolizumab. Before starting the expansion part, the combination will be tested in another small group of participants (12-28) to find out how safe this combination is.\n\nExpansion: In this part of the study, BNT314 will be combined with pembrolizumab. After the SRI is completed, the study will continue with the expansion part where up to 199 participants with different types of cancer will be included.\n\nThe Phase 2 part of the study will be introduced via an amendment to the study protocol.",

In the combination therapy SRI and expansion part, BNT314 will be combined with pembrolizumab and administered intravenously in periodic cycles to patients with selected cancer indications.\n\nAdditional cohorts (backfill cohorts) administering BNT314 as monotherapy will assign patients to specific DLs, based on the emerging safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic data. This would allow for further assessment of dose- and exposure-response relationships for clinical activity, safety, and tolerability to support BNT314 dose optimization.\n\nThe treatment period will last until progressive disease (PD), confirmed PD (as per immune response evaluation criteria in solid tumors \\[iRECIST\\]), unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent, whichever happens first.\n\nFor the combination therapy, the maximum treatment period will be 2 years.
