    "brief_summary": "The First Long-Acting Injectable Regimen (FLAIR) study is being conducted to establish if human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infected adult participants whose virus is virologically suppressed on an integrase inhibitor single tablet regimen (INI STR) will remain suppressed after switching to a two-drug intramuscular (IM) long-acting (LA) regimen of cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV). In this study, the INI STR will be limited to abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine (ABC/DTG/3TC). FLAIR is a Phase 3, multi-phase, randomized, open label, active-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group, non-inferiority study in HIV-1, anti-retroviral therapy (ART)-na\u00efve adult participants. This study is designed to demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity of switching to a two drug CAB LA 400 mg + RPV LA 600 mg regimen every 4 weeks (Q4W: monthly) compared to remaining on ABC/DTG/3TC over 48 weeks (4 weeks oral CAB + RPV, 44 weeks LA therapy). Participants who are HLA-B\\*5701 positive at Screening may enroll into the study and receive DTG plus a non-abacavir containing dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) regimen. Eligible participants will enroll into the Induction Phase of the study and receive ABC/DTG/3TC for 20 weeks (Week \\[-20\\] to Day 1). Participants who have an HIV 1 ribose nucleic acid (RNA) \\<50 copies per milliliter (c/mL) at Week (-4) will be randomized (1:1) into the Maintenance Phase at Day 1 to either continue ABC/DTG/3TC or to discontinue ABC/DTG/3TC and begin oral therapy with CAB 30 mg + RPV 25 mg once daily for approximately 4 Weeks, followed by monthly CAB LA + RPV LA injections from visit Week 4b until study completion or withdrawal. Participants who successfully complete Week 100 (without meeting study defined withdrawal criteria and who remain virologically suppressed through Week 96: HIV-1 RNA \\<50 c/mL) will be given the option to switch to the LA arm in the Extension Phase (using an optional oral lead-in with CAB + RPV) or be withdrawn from the study. Participants will continue to receive injections every 4 weeks during the Extension Phase until CAB LA and RPV LA are either locally approved and commercially available, the participant no longer derives clinical benefit, the participant meets a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation, or until development of either CAB LA or RPV LA is terminated.",

Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision.

To compare the time to PSA progression by Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG) criteria between treatment arms.\n\nII. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of apalutamide in combination with SBRT.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To characterize the metastatic pattern at baseline and at progression in these patients and to determine whether features of the baseline PSMA-PET scan are associated with treatment outcomes.\n\nOUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Participants receive apalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28.

    "detailed_description": "This study addresses an important question: Can daratumumab safely be administered prior to matched sibling donor (MSD) nonmyeloablative hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) for SCD to avoid pure red blood cell aplasia in patients at risk of this complication? and thus achieve an event-free survival similar to patients without anti-donor red blood cell (RBC) antibodies?\n\nPatients with anti-donor RBC antibodies, which includes patients with major ABO mismatch and other RBC alloantibodies against donor, have largely been excluded from the nonmyeloablative HCT approach given their risk of delayed donor RBC engraftment and/or hemolysis post-HCT. Exclusion of these patients limits access to less toxic curative therapies for this population at risk for toxicity due to their underlying multisystem disease. To address this need, we propose a multicenter clinical trial of Sickle cell disease Using a Nonmyeloablative approach: adding daratumumab for patients with anti-donor Red cell AntibodY (SUN-RAY). If successful, this trial will increase access to MSD nonmyeloablative HCT in SCD and will provide important safety and efficacy data for the use of daratumumab in the pre-HCT setting as well as in patients with SCD who have limited RBC donor options due to alloimmunization.\n\nThis is a phase 2 study given that the studied nonmyeloablative conditioning backbone (alemtuzumab, 300 cGY TBI, sirolimus) has been previously used effectively in both adults and children with SCD. Daratumumab will be added to this backbone with a washout period of 4 weeks prior to HCT infusion. Small case series have demonstrated that daratumumab is well tolerated either pre-HCT to treat patients with antibodies against mismatched donor HLA antigens, or post-HCT in patients with autoimmune cytopenias. The experience of the phase 2 clinical trial NCT03384654 studying daratumumab in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia provides additional support for the safety and dosing of daratumumab for this study.",
