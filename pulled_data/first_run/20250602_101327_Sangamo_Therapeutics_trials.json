    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TX200-TR101 and its effects on the donated kidney in living donor kidney transplant recipients. TX200-TR101 is a product made from a kidney transplant recipient's own immune cells, which are genetically modified and designed to help the transplant recipient's body accept their donated kidney and prevent their immune system from rejecting it.",
    "detailed_description": "This is a multicentre, first-in-human, open-label, single ascending dose, dose-ranging study of autologous, chimeric antigen receptor T regulatory cells (CAR-Treg) in HLA-A2 mismatched living donor kidney transplant recipients, with a control cohort of mismatched kidney transplant recipients of similar immunological risk.The aim is for the CAR-Tregs to recognise the HLA-A2 molecule present on the donated kidney and subsequently induce and maintain immunological tolerance to the organ.\n\nThe study requires three different types of participants - transplant recipients who will receive the study treatment TX200-TR101; control participants, who are transplant recipients who will not receive the study treatment; and transplant donors, who will donate their kidney to the transplant recipients.",

    "detailed_description": "This research is being done to study a possible treatment for refractory pain due to small fiber neuropathy (iSFN).\n\nSmall fiber neuropathy happens when something damages small nerve fibers in your skin, causing symptoms like painful tingling or burning sensations in your hands and feet. Pain originating in the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord is defined by doctors as neuropathic pain. Scientists have discovered that certain proteins in our bodies called sodium channels are important for communicating pain signals in nerves, specifically, Nav1.7, Nav1.8 and Nav1.9. About half of small fiber neuropathy cases happen for no known reason. Doctors may call these cases \"idiopathic small fiber neuropathy\" or \"iSFN\".\n\nThis first-in-human study will test the use of a type of experimental treatment called \"gene therapy.\" The primary goal is to determine if is safe and well tolerated. The second goal is to determine if it reduces the level of refractory pain due to iSFN disease. The gene will be delivered into your cells using a special delivery tool called a vector.",
