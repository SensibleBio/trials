These data are collected during unsupervised digital tests performed in the patient's home environment between consultations.\n\nThe primary objective is to demonstrate the correlation of the MuCopilot digital tests at home (D1) with the results of their standard counterparts (D0) carried out in-clinic.\n\nA secondary objective is to determine the accuracy, reliability and reproducibility of tests results, as well as to study the test-retest of the PRO. The study also aims to assess the safety, usability, and satisfaction of the solution.\n\nExploratory objectives include evaluating the relationship between MuCopilot's scores and other standards such as FVC, FEV1/FVC ratio as well as to explore the correlation with the cough monitoring with patient's perception.\n\nPatients will be able to download MuCopilot app. They will participate in 1 inclusion visit and 7 follow-up visits, scheduled at Day 1, Day 3, Day 5, Day 7, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months - 1 day.\n\nThe study will include 70 CF patients and will be conducted in France.",
