    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to investigate whether Bevacizumab (an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody) added to a backbone chemotherapy regimen (Temozolomide, Irinotecan-Temozolomide or Topotecan-Temozolomide) demonstrates activity in children with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. Also, to investigate whether the addition of Irinotecan or Topotecan to Temozolomide increases the activity of chemotherapy.The primary objective of the study is the best response (Complete Response or Partial Response) while trial treatment, within 18 or 24 weeks depending on the arm of the trial the participant is randomised to. Secondary endpoints are assessing the side effects, the length of time before progression (Progression Free Survival) and overall survival (OS).\n\nThis trial will address two important questions:\n\n* does targeting blood vessel development using bevacizumab, (a monoclonal antibody against the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)), add to the effect on a tumour when used with existing chemotherapy, compared to the effect of the existing chemotherapy alone (temozolomide)? NOTE- This question has been completed.\n* does the addition of a second chemotherapy drug (irinotecan or topotecan) increase the effect on a tumour compared to the effect of one alone (temozolomide) NOTE - This question has been completed.\n* does the addition of dinutuximab beta added to a backbone chemotherapy (temozolomide or temozolomide + topotecan) increase the effect of backbone alone.\n\nPatients aged 1-21 years of age with relapsed or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma are randomised to one of two treatment arms: temozolomide-topotecan (TTo) or dinutuximab beta-temozolomide-topotecan (dBTTo). Temozolomide (T), irinotecan-temozolomide (IT), bevacizumab-T (BT), BIT (bevacizumab-IT), bevacizumab-temozolomide-topotecan (BTTo) and dinutuximab beta-temozolomide (dBT) are now closed to recruitment.",

Cognitive disorders frequency in MS is estimated between 40 and 60%. Cognitive impairment affects quality of life and vocational status in MS patients.\n\nUntil recently, little information was available on the cognitive dysfunction and their evolution that occur in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) as compared with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). In PPMS pathological studies have shown the importance of cortical demyelination and meningeal inflammation suggesting that the GM alteration could play a major role in the cognitive impairment in this phenotype. The cognitive evolution and the brain tissue alteration at the origin of these difficulties remain poorly understood in PPMS. The use of new techniques for morphological and functional MRI can study the contribution of diffuse White Matter (WM) alteration (probably through disconnexion of relevant network) and diffuse Grey matter (GM) alterations in the cerebral cortex and other structures (the hippocampi, the cerebellum, and the thalami) in cognitive impairment in PPMS patients and on their evolution.",

    "detailed_description": "Extended field or total nodal irradiation had been the gold standard for early stage follicular lymphoma for a long time in Germany. An involved field (IF) irradiation has been favored due to the toxicity of large field irradiation in other countries (e.g. USA). However, smaller irradiation fields have been accompanied with an increased risk of recurrence. A combination of involved field irradiation with the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab (MIR trial) has led to similar efficacy results compared to the large field irradiation but with markedly reduced side effects.\n\nHaas et al. showed in a prospective trial, that a low dose radiation therapy (LDRT) can lead to a complete remission in up to 60% in follicular lymphoma. This is presumed to result from immune modulatory effects induced by LDRT. The effectiveness of LDRT could also be demonstrated in another prospective, randomized British trial (FORT trial: 2 x2 Gy vs. 12 x 2 Gy) with a CR rate of 40% after 2 x 2 Gy (60% after 12 x 2 Gy). Currently, it is unknown, which patients need a higher radiation dose and which not.\n\nA metabolic complete remission (CR) is an important prognostic marker for progression-free survival. According to the results of the PRIMA trial, CR is a very strong predictive parameter if the CR is established using FDG-PET.\n\nIn the present GAZAI trial, patients with early stage nodular follicular lymphoma will be treated in a combined approach of immunotherapy with an anti-CD20 antibody and small field (involved site) irradiation as in the MIR trial. In GAZAI, the fully humanized anti-CD20 antibody Obinutuzumab (GAZYVARO) will be used, which showed a high efficacy in combination with bendamustin in patients with follicular lymphoma refractory to Rituximab (GADOLIN trial). In addition, the radiation dose will be limited to 2 x2 Gy in responding patients. A dose build-up to a total of 40 Gy (dose in the MIR trial) will be performed in case of failure to achieve a complete CR based on a FDG-PET in week 18.\n\nPrimary endpoint of the trial is the rate of CR (based on FDG-PET/CT) after Obinutuzumab and 2x2 Gy IS radiotherapy in week 18. Secondary endpoints are the morphological CR rate in week 7, week 18 and month 6, the PFS, the toxicity, the recurrence rate, the recurrence pattern, overall survival and quality of life.",

    "brief_summary": "In this clinical trial adult patients diagnosed with follicular lymphoma and relapse or progression of disease within 24 months of starting first line treatment will be treated with mosunetuzumab. This is a bispecific antibody, a new type of immunotherapy that redirects the bodies own immune cells (T-cells) to attack and kill the lymphoma cells. The main question the trial aims to answer is if mosunetuzumab works better than standard treatments in this sub-group of patients. Patients will receive mosunetuzumab as injections in the abdominal subcutaneous fat once a week for the three first doses, then every third week 7 times. If all signs of disease are gone as evaluated by PET-CT images, the treatment is stopped. If signs of disease remain on PET-CT images, the patients can receive treatment every third week for up to a total of one year. After the end of treatment, patients are followed two years in the trial for signs of progression or relapse.",
    "detailed_description": "Background: Standard first line treatment for patients with follicular lymphoma and symptomatic disease is immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy. The most commonly used treatment regimens are rituximab plus bendamustin or CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone), rituximab plus lenalidomide or rituximab monotherapy. The long-term outcome is similar for these regimens; 75-80% of patients are alive 10 years after initial treatment. A subgroup of 20-40% of patients does not respond to or relapse within 24 months of initial treatment (abbreviated POD24 for \"progression of disease within 24 months), and they risk poorer effect of second line treatments and shorter survival. Only 30-70% of these patients are alive 5 years after initial treatment, depending on the type of first line treatment, and they are in need of improved treatment options. Mosunetuzumab is a new, bispecific, T-cell engaging antibody that has shown very high response rates and long response duration in B-cell lymphoma patients with multiple relapses or lack of response to standard salvage regimens. It is therefore possible that mosunetuzumab will benefit patients with POD24. The main hypothesis of this trial is that mosunetuzumab is better than standard 2nd line salvage regimens in terms of progression free survival 2 years after the initiation of 2nd line treatment in POD24 patients.\n\nObjectives: The main objective is to investigate the efficacy of subcutaneous (SC) mosunetuzumab monotherapy in follicular lymphoma (FL) with POD24.\n\nThe secondary objectives are to investigate\n\n* safety of mosunetuzumab in patients with a current POD24 event\n* prognostic significance of 18F-FDG-PET-CT response to mosunetuzumab\n* rate of transformation to higher grade lymphoma following mosunetuzumab\n* patients\u00b4 self-reported quality of life during and after mosunetuzumab\n* resource usage related to mosunetuzumab\n\nInterventions: Mosunetuzumab is administered SC as described below. Patients are followed for at least 2,5 years and a maximum of 5 years in the trial. Study-specific sampling of peripheral blood for exploratory research amounts to 330-380 mL (depending on the number of treatment cycles) collected over 3 years. Study-specific tumor samples for future research will be collected by fine needle aspiration before the start of treatment and after the third treatment cycle.\n\nEthical considerations: Previous studies have shown that mosunetuzumab is highly effective and well tolerated in heavily treated B-cell lymphoma patients. The safety profile is favourable compared to standard immunochemotherapy. Mosunetuzumab can be safely administered to older patients with co-morbidities, and there is no upper age limit for participation in the trial. The potential beneficial effect of mosunetuzumab in a population of follicular lymphoma patients with POD24 outweighs the risk for rare and undiscovered serious adverse events. The total volume of blood samples is considered acceptable for patients in clinical trials. The extra tumor samples for research purposes will only be collected if deemed safe and not to cause unreasonable discomfort for the participating subject. The extra number of CT scans is 2-3 compared to standard practice and represents a minimal increase in radiation exposure. In total, the benefit to risk balance is deemed positive for this trial.",

    "brief_summary": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a rapidly proliferating, neuroendocrine tumor that accounts for about 15% of all lung cancers. Most patients have metastases at primary diagnosis involving sites like bone, adrenal glands, liver and brain.\n\nCompared with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) SCLC has a unique natural history with a shorter doubling time, higher growth fraction, earlier development of widespread metastases, and uniform initial response to chemo- or radiotherapy.\n\nThe combination of cis- or carboplatin and etoposide is the standard of care in the first-line treatment of stage IV (extensive-disease) SCLC (ED-SCLC). Despite response rates of 50-80%, most patients relapse within six months and the median survival time is less than 10 months. Between 14 and 23% of SCLC patients develop brain metastases.\n\nNew cytotoxic agents as well as targeted therapies have not been able to show any improvement of survival in this group of patients.\n\nEarly phase trials of PD 1/PD L1-blocking immunotherapeutic agents in patients with recurrent or ED SCLC have shown promising response rates and good tolerability. Immunotherapy may also contribute to the efficacy of systemic treatment by maintaining initial responses to chemotherapy. A double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial indicates that the addition of atezolizumab to standard chemotherapy significantly improves overall survival and progression-free survival compared with chemotherapy alone in treatment-na\u00efve patients with ED-SCLC who are in good general condition (ECOG 0 or 1). However, about one in three SCLC patients has a poor performance status (ECOG\u22652), which is associated with even shorter survival times of under eight months. At present, there is little information regarding the feasibility, safety and efficacy of adding atezolizumab to standard chemotherapy for this considerable fraction of patients.\n\nThe investigators expect, that atezolizumab in addition to chemotherapy is feasible in patients with stage IV SCLC and reduced performance status and therefore crucial efficacy data can be acquired in this trial to evaluate a putative Phase III transition in this particular patient population.",

    "brief_summary": "n the present study the neoadjuvant approach with the anti-HER2 trastuzumab and pertuzumab combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel will be used to compare the Event-Free Survival (EFS) in regimens with and without atezolizumab. Following the neoadjuvant part of the study, after surgery all patients will continue to receive trastuzumab and pertuzumab to complete one year of anti-HER2 therapy. Similarly, patients allocated to receive atezolizumab will continue atezolizumab to complete one year In addition, several IHC and molecular assays will be performed before and during the period of chemotherapy administration and at surgery with the goal of defining a marker of efficacy to be later validated in a larger adjuvant setting.",
    "detailed_description": "Dual targeting of HER2 with trastuzumab and pertuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer is linked to clinical evidence of reversal of initial resistance to trastuzumab (Baselga J et al, J Clin Oncol 2010) in cases progressing on trastuzumab therapy, and in dramatic improvement in progression free and overall survival when the two monoclonal antibodies are used in combination with docetaxel (THP regimen) as first line therapy of metastatic disease as shown in the CLEOPATRA study (Swain S et al, ESMO abstract 2014). The randomized NeoSphere study showed that the same THP regimen given for 4 cycles as neoadjuvant treatment increased the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) over that with conventional docetaxel and trastuzumab or docetaxel and pertuzumab (Gianni L et al, Lancet Oncol 2012).\n\nEncouraging clinical data emerging in the field of tumor immunotherapy have demonstrated that therapies focused on enhancing T cell responses against cancer can result in a significant survival benefit in patients with advanced malignancies (Hodi FS and Dranoff G, J Cutan Pathol 2010; Kantoff PW et al, New Engl J Med 2010; Chen DS et al, Clin Cancer Res 2012). Many human tumors have been found to overexpress PD L1, which acts to suppress anti tumor immunity. PD 1 is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells following T cell activation, which is sustained in states of chronic stimulation, such as in chronic infection or canc Atezolizumab is a human monoclonal antibody containing an engineered Fc-domain to optimize efficacy and safety that targets PD-L1 and blocks binding of its receptors, including PD-1 and B7.1.\n\nIn addition to being involved in the natural progression of cancer, immunity can affect the activity of various anticancer agents. Accordingly, recent evidence suggests that some chemotherapeutic drugs, such as anthracyclines and oxaliplatin, rely on the induction of anticancer immune responses. Immune responses also play a major role in the efficacy of targeted therapies with monoclonal antibodies (Stagg J et al, Breast Care 2012). Studies have shown monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab and rituximab rely in part on immunemediated killing through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). While innate immune responses appear to be important for tumor antigen-targeted monoclonal antibody therapies, recent studies in mice and correlative clinical evidence suggest that trastuzumab may also stimulate adaptive antitumor immunity. These studies raise the possibility that combination strategies may be used to capitalize on the adaptive tumor-specific immunity generated by anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies.\n\nBased on these considerations, we plan to conduct a randomized neoadjuvant study of the combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without atezolizumab in women with early high-risk and locally advanced HER2-positive suitable for neoadjuvant therapy. One study arm will also include anthracycline and cyclophosphamide.",

Because most patients in the Western world present with advanced stages long term survival is found in about 25%, with local recurrences as part of treatment failure in up to 80% of cases. Studies examining the role of more extended lymph node dissections (D1 vs. D2), adjuvant radiotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy did not result in a clinical relevant improvement of survival. In 2001 results of a South West Oncology group (SWOG) trial that randomized between surgery and surgery with chemoradiotherapy were published. This trial, that was hampered by suboptimal surgery (less than D1 in majority of patients) and radiotherapy (2D radiotherapy; 35% protocol deviations) showed an absolute increase in median survival of 9 months. More recently results of the MAGIC study, which randomized between surgery and surgery plus 6 perioperative courses of ECF chemotherapy, were presented. This regimen resulted in an absolute 5-year survival benefit of 13% and in a 10% higher resectability rate.\n\nThis phase III prospectively randomized study investigates whether chemoradiotherapy (45 Gy in 5 weeks with daily cisplatin and capecitabine) after preoperative chemotherapy (3x ECC (epirubicin, cisplatin, capecitabine)) and adequate (D1+) surgery leads to improved survival in comparison with postoperative chemotherapy (3x ECC).

Depending on the MZL subtype Rituximab/chemotherapy is able to induce in part long remissions, but do not prevent relapse later on. In addition, chemotherapy associated toxicity is often problematic in MZL patients, who are mostly of advanced age. Thus, chemotherapy - free approaches are highly attractive for this patient group. Rituximab single agent is a widely used chemotherapy - free approach in MZL, but was significantly inferior compared to Rituximab/chlorambucil in a large randomized prospective clinical trial in treatment na\u00efve MZL with a CR rate of 56 % vs. 80%, respectively (P\\<0.001).Thus, it is the major aim to develop chemotherapy - free approaches for MZL, which approach efficacy of rituximab/chemotherapy combinations, but avoid chemotherapy associated toxicities. This in particular important in MZL as many physicians are reluctant to treat these often elderly patients with more intense treatments and prefer single agent therapies in these very often well and long responding lymphoma subtype. The type II anti-CD20 antibody Obinutuzumab (OBINUTUZUMAB) has demonstrated remarkable activity in follicular lymphoma and superiority to Rituximab in combination with chemotherapy in treatment na\u00efve (Gallium trial) and rituximab refractory follicular lymphoma (Gadolin trial) as well as in CLL in combination with chlorambucil. Based on these observations it is the aim of this study to test the toxicity and efficacy of the anti-CD20 antibody Obinutuzumab (OBINUTUZUMAB) in patients with newly diagnosed MZL in need of treatment, who are not eligible or failed local therapy, following the assumption that this novel anti-CD20 antibody is significantly more effective than Rituximab single agent therapy, and avoids chemotherapy - related toxicity.",

For efficacy the rate of complete remissions (according to the GELA criteria for gastric MALT or to the Cheson 2007 criteria for non-gastric extranodal, nodal and splenic MZL) after induction therapy will be primarily analysed. For toxicity treatment associated adverse events, quality of life and cumulative incidence of secondary malignancies will be documented.\n\nThe study is a multicenter, single-arm, open-label, phase II trial of 6 cycles of Obinutuzumab in the induction phase followed by a maintenance phase for a maximum of 12 infusions of Obinutuzumab every 8 weeks in patients aged \u2265 18 years with previously untreated MZL in need of treatment.\n\nThe study flow will be as follows:\n\n* Previously untreated patients will be screened for eligibility for the trial. If the patient is eligible for the study, the patient will be registered before the first cycle of induction treatment.\n* Patients who progress at any time point during induction are considered as treatment failure. They will be followed up for overall survival until death.\n* Patients, who achieve at least a SD after induction treatment will be eligible to receive maintenance therapy with Obinutuzumab.\n\nIt is expected that a total of 56 patients at approximately 20 investigator sites will be registered. Every patient will receive treatment over a time period of 6 x 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance phase of every 8 weeks for a maximum of 12 infusions until progression or study drug - related intolerable toxicity.

Focusing on a central visual \"patient-based\" classification that captures the entire disease burden, a side-by-side display will be used, comparing baseline FDG-PET/CT (which identifies all FDG-positive metastases regardless of their HER2-imaging status) and HER2-PET/CT. Subjects will be categorized into two HER2-PET/CT patterns (positive vs. negative) based on proportion of FDG-avid tumour load with significant 89Zr-trastuzumab uptake. Lesion uptake will be considered significant/pertinent if it is visually higher than the local background.\n\n* HER2-PET/CT positive pattern: The entire or majority of the tumour load shows significant tracer uptake.\n* HER2-PET/CT negative pattern: The dominant part or all of the tumour load lacks significant tracer uptake.\n\nSubjects classified as \"positive\" (cohort A) will receive T-DM1 as monotherapy, IV 3.6mg/kg every 3 weeks (21 days +- 3 days) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or request of the subject to withdraw from the study.

At the early FDG-PET/CT assessment (before cycle 2), response assessment will be done using a cut-off of 15% based on the CONSIST criteria. Subjects who demonstrate a partial or complete response (responders) and will continue treatment with T-DM1. Subjects who exhibit stable disease or disease progression (non-responders) will discontinue study treatment and enter the survival follow-up period. For responders, subsequent metabolic evaluations will be performed every 3 months, with FDG-PET/CT. Treatment response will be assessed according to metabolic response. For these subjects, blood samples will be obtained at all metabolic reassessments (mandatory).\n\nThe subjects with HER2 PET/CT classified as \"negative\" (cohort B) will receive treatment of physician's choice (TPC) as per the best local clinical practice. Subsequent treatment will be collected and the subject will enter survival follow-up.\n\nAll enrolled subjects will undergo a mandatory biopsy during the pre-treatment period.

Efficacy assessment will be assessed by the ability of Omalizumab to reduce clinical response to OFC. The safety of omalizumab will be concomitantly recorded. Specifically, we will:\n\n1. Examine TEWL, STS lipidomics, metabolomics, cytokines, and proteomics in 30 patients with a history of IgE-mediated reaction to 1 or more foods assessed by sensitization food extracts using skin prick tests, serum IgE to specific foods and/or relevant component proteins, and an IgE-mediated clinical reaction to a food on OFC.\n2. Confirm the diagnosis of IgE-mediated FA in all patients with a positive OFC.\n3. Treat all 30 patients with omalizumab for 4 months\n4. Repeat OFC after 4 months of omalizumab therapy.\n5. To analyze TEWL, STS Lipidomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and cytokines in all 30 patients who were treated with omalizumab and completed the end of study OFC.\n\nSample size will be 30 completed subjects. Enrollment will occur over the course of 16 months, with 2-4 participants enrolling each month. Up to ten healthy control subjects will also be enrolled for skin tape strip analysis and TEWL as a comparator group to the FA group.\n\nAll participants will have an initial screening visit where their clinical history of having an IgE-mediated reaction to specified food(s) will be elucidated, along with review of relevant skin prick test (SPT), food-specific IgE values, and Total IgE. If these values were not obtained within the last 12 months, SPT, sIgE, and/or Total IgE will be performed at screening. All food-allergic participants will undergo an open Screening OFC to one of their food allergens. For continuation in the study, the participant must experience dose-limiting symptoms consistent with an IgE-mediated reaction, at or before 444mg of food protein cumulatively. If they have a negative OFC, additional screening OFCs may be performed to any eligible food. STS and TEWL measurements will be performed prior to the first dose, as well as before the second and third doses. If/when the participant has dose-limiting symptoms, STS and TEWL will be stopped immediately.\n\nAll food-allergic participants will receive omalizumab for 4 months. All injections will be administered by a research nurse on the clinical research unit. At the midway point of the study (2 months after the first omalizumab injection), the participant will have STS and TEWL measurements performed.\n\nAfter 4 months of omalizumab administration, an end of study OFC will be performed to the same food that was positive at the screening OFC to assess treatment effect, along with analysis of the STS and TEWL.",

The two study medicines are given after a single dose of obinutuzumab which is the third study medicine.\n\nDLBCL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). NHL is a cancer of the lymphatic system. It develops when the body makes abnormal B lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that normally help to fight infections.\n\nThis study is seeking adult participants who:\n\n* Have histologically confirmed diagnosis of DLBCL\n* Have received at least two first lines of treatment for NHL.\n* Are unable or unwilling to undergo a stem cell transplant or CAR-T cell therapy.\n\nStem cell transplant is a procedure in which a patient receives healthy blood-forming cells to replace their own stem cells that have been destroyed by treatment.\n\nA CAR-T therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells.\n\nEveryone in this study will receive all three medicines at the study site by intravenous (IV) infusion which is given directly into a vein. The two study medicines (maplirpacept \\[PF-07901801\\] and glofitamab) will be given in 21-day cycles.\n\nAt Cycle 0, participants will receive a single dose of obinutuzumab pre-treatment followed by two step-up doses of glofitamab. The combination of maplirpacept (PF-07901801) with glofitamab full dose will be administered for the first time at Cycle 1 Day 1.\n\nMaplirpacept (PF-07901801) will be given weekly for the first three cycles and then every three weeks. Glofitamab will be given every 3 weeks for approximately 9 months. Thereafter participants will continue to receive maplirpacept alone.\n\nMaplirpacept (PF-07901801) will be given at different doses to different participants. Everyone taking part will receive the same fixed doses of glofitamab and obinutuzumab studied in patients with DLBCL.\n\nThe study will compare the experiences of people receiving different doses of maplirpacept (PF-07901801).

It will be explored the combination of bevacizumab plus atezolizumab, with no patient selection based on PD-L1 expression, allowing an all-comer assessment of atezolizumab activity.\n\nThe study is a randomized open label phase III trial to investigate the impact of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab and cisplatin or carboplatin /paclitaxel chemotherapy on overall survival and will employ the intent to treat principle, and random assignment to one of the 2 arms will be balanced according to disease histology (squamous cell carcinoma vs adenocarcinoma), prior platinum therapy as a radiation sensitizer (no prior cis-Radiotherapy (RT) versus prior cis-RT) and chemotherapy backbone (cisplatin vs carboplatin).\n\nThis trial will be run in an open label design due to the following considerations: the control arm is the standard of care for women diagnosed with metastatic, persistant or recurrent cervical cancer because of its impact on overall survival and the primary endpoint of the study is overall survival (OS), so blinding is not needed to ensure a robust assessment.",
    "detailed_description": "Given that both Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and PD-L1 appear important in cervical cancer pathogenesis, this study is designed to test the hypothesis that breaking of immune tolerance by PD-1/PD-L1 blockade will enhance the efficacy of anti-VEGF therapy in the treatment of patients with metastatic , persistent or recurrent cervical cancer. There are several data suggesting that atezolizumab and bevacizumab may be synergistic. Enhanced tumor angiogenesis is commonly associated with absence of tumor-infiltrating T cells in patients. There is evidence in ovarian cancer that tumor expression of VEGF is negatively correlated to the density of CD8+ TILs and this phenotype is associated with early recurrence, consistent with prior studies showing a correlation of VEGF to early recurrence and short survival. Furthermore, in ascites, high levels of VEGF correlate to low numbers of NK T-like CD3+CD56+ cells.\n\nIn addition to promoting tumor angiogenesis, there is increasing evidence that VEGF plays a role in cancer immune evasion through several different mechanisms. Indeed, emerging evidence suggests that the endothelium acts as a selective barrier, allowing certain T cell subsets, notably T regulatory (Treg) cells, to traffic more effectively into the tumor contributing to tumor immune tolerance. In addition, some experiments have shown that tumour hypoxia promotes the recruitment of regulatory T (T reg) cells through induction of expression of the chemokine CC-chemokine ligand 28 (CCL28), which, in turn, promotes tumour tolerance and angiogenesis.\n\nSome immunosuppressive activities of VEGF, however, can be reversed by inhibition of VEGF signaling. Mice exposed to pathophysiologic levels of VEGF exhibited impaired dendritic cell function, which could be restored by blockade of VEGFR2.\n\nIn turn, the anti-tumor effect of angiogenesis blockade requires CD8+ T cells supporting the notion that VEGF-A do not simply promote tumor growth through angiogenesis. Thus, peripheral immune tolerance and angiogenesis programs seem closely connected and cooperating to sustain tumour growth.\n\nIn addition, there is evidence that anti-VEGF therapy and immunotherapy act synergistically. Motz et al have suggested that the combination of anti-VEGF-A antibody and immunotherapy with adoptive T cell transfer led to a superior infiltration of tumor-reactive T cells than any single approach. Indeed, in a murine melanoma model, VEGF blockade synergized with adoptive immunotherapy, as evidenced by improved anti-tumor activity, prolonged survival, and increased trafficking of T cells into tumors. These data are reminiscent of the additive benefit observed in patients by combining recombinant interferon-alpha therapy and bevacizumab, a recombinant, humanized therapeutic antibody directed against VEGF, for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.\n\nMore evidence has come from a clinical study of subjects with melanoma combining the checkpoint inhibitor (anti-CTLA-4) ipilimumab and bevacizumab. In 46 patients, the combined therapy yielded a 19.6% objective response rate, stable disease in 13%. All responses were durable \\>6 months and median survival was 25.1 months, much prolonged compared to ipilimumab's expectation in metastatic melanoma. Activated vessel endothelium with extensive CD8+ T cell and macrophage cell infiltration was observed in post-treatment biopsies, as well as marked increases in CD4/CCR7/CD45ROm central memory cells in peripheral blood in the majority of patients.\n\nThus, an emerging paradigm supported by the data above is that angiogenesis and immune suppression are two facets of a linked biological program. Tumors seem to co-opt these existing mechanisms that are normally required to limit excessive inflammation and promote tissue recovery during infection or wound healing. The execution of this program sustains tumor growth and promotes immunologic tolerance. Because of the intimate relationship between angiogenesis and immunosuppression, it is thus expected that inhibiting both pathways will result in improved and more durable clinical benefit.",

    "brief_summary": "A quality improvement study on the diagnostics and clinical management of bloodstream infection episodes. Patients of all ages and genders with positive blood cultures collected for standard patient care are included in the study. In the intervention group of patients, positive blood cultures will be analysed with the cobas\u00ae eplex (Roche) blood culture panels in addition to conventional, standard-of-care (SOC) culture methods. The control group will include patients with positive blood cultures analysed using conventional, standard-of-care (SOC) culture methods. The study aims to determine the effect of rapid molecular testing using the cobas\u00ae eplex blood culture panels (Roche) in the clinical management of bloodstream infections and more specifically the effect of the eplex result on the time to most effective/targeted antibiotic treatment. The primary objective is to investigate the difference in time to most effective antibiotic treatment between the control and intervention group. The secondary aims are to analyze the concordance of results and compare the user-friendliness, hands-on time and turnaround times of the eplex to the SOC culture methods as well as to compare the difference in the length of stay, antibiotic intensity score at 96h after Gram staining and patient outcome (30-day, all cause mortality and 30-day readmission) in the control and intervention group.",
    "detailed_description": "Bloodstream infections (BSIs) impose a considerable burden on patients and healthcare systems due to the need for hospital admission, extended stays, additional diagnostic tests and specific treatments. Receiving inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy can increase the risk of renal and hepatic toxicity, antibiotic resistance, opportunistic infections and mortality. Therefore, early identification of the causative pathogens and their resistance patterns is of utmost importance.\n\nThe gold standard for diagnosis of BSIs is through blood cultures. To detect bacteremia or fungemia, blood from patients is collected and incubated in blood culture bottles. When using conventional culture methods, a positive blood bottle is investigated using direct microscopic investigation, gram-staining, inoculation of selective and non-selective agars, MALDI-TOF identification, rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) and standardized AST methods. These methods require several (manual) steps and days of turn-around-time. Following the collection of a blood culture, time to result depends on several factors such as the time needed for transporting the blood bottles and loading in the incubator, the growth rate of bacteria or fungi as well as the time to obtain the identification and AST result.\n\nRapid diagnostic tests to improve the time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy have been developed. Most tests involve organism identification and genotypic resistance profiles. Rapid molecular diagnostic testing, such as multiplex PCR methods, enable early identification of bacteria or fungi and their antimicrobial resistance genes (results within less than 2 hours after initiation of the test). This helps minimize the time needed to initiate effective antimicrobial therapy. Commercial diagnostic systems to accelerate the identification and detection of antibiotic resistance genes of causative pathogens in BSI have been developed. Examples include Cepheid\u00ae GeneXpert, BioFire\u00ae FilmArray\u00aeTM, and Roche eplex\u00ae. The system used in this study, the eplex system, is a random access multiplex PCR platform combining extraction of nucleic acids and rapid RT-PCR. Three Blood Culture Identification (BCID) panels are used to identify the disease-causing organisms: Gram-positive panel, Gram-negative panel and Fungal Pathogen panel. These panels are designed to detect 56 different organisms covering 95% of pathogens commonly associated with BSIs and 10 common antibiotic resistance genes.\n\nThe objective of this study is to assess the impact of rapid molecular testing on positive blood cultures with the cobas\u00ae eplex system (Roche) on antibiotic therapy and patient outcome.\n\nIn this study, we prospectively evaluate the performance of the eplex system for pathogen identification and detection of resistance markers compared to routine SOC for bloodstream infections. The potential impact of the eplex on time to optimization (inititiation, discontinuation, escalation or de-escalation) of antimicrobial therapy and patient outcome will be evaluated.\n\nIn summary, Finally, this study will evaluate the potential benefits of implementing CE-IVD registered syndromic diagnostic testing of bloodstream infections.",

    "detailed_description": "High pathological complete response (pCR)-rates are seen using different neoadjuvant chemotherapy schedules with trastuzumab and pertuzumab in HER2-positive stage II - III breast cancer patients. Total pCR rates in breast and axilla have been described as high as 64%, and with an even higher rate of \\>80% in patients with HER2-positive and hormone receptor (HR) negative tumors. PCR is associated with better long-term outcomes in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Three year progression-free survival ranges between 85-90%. Neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer typically consists of six to nine cycles of treatment. Longer duration of treatment is associated with higher pCR-rates but gives more toxicity. Pathological complete responses are sometimes seen after only 10-12 days of neoadjuvant treatment. It is therefore important to investigate which patients can safely be treated with less than six cycles of chemotherapy and who requires more than six cycles for maximum activity.\n\nThe radiologic response of a breast tumor after neoadjuvant therapy is predictive of the pathologic response, although the accuracy differs between breast cancer subtypes. It is hypothesized that patients with an early complete radiologic response may not benefit from additional chemotherapy and can be referred for early surgery. Patients who have not achieved pCR after early surgery despite radiologic complete response (rCR) are candidates for further adjuvant chemotherapy to complete the initially planned number of treatment cycles and maintain maximum treatment activity. Imaged guided de-escalation in which the number of treatment cycles is determined by the radiologic response could thus reduce toxicity in neoadjuvant treatment while maintaining activity.\n\nThis study will evaluate the efficacy of image-guided de-escalation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.\n\nTo maintain efficacy, patients who do not achieve pCR will complete a total of nine cycles taxane-containing chemotherapy followed by 14 cycles of treatment with adjuvant T-DM1. Patients who achieve early pCR will continue treatment with Herceptin\u00ae and pertuzumab to complete one full year of treatment.",

Widespread use of an oral agent effective at reducing worsening of DR would decrease the numbers of patients who undergo more invasive and much more expensive treatment for DR and who are consequently at risk for side effects that adversely affect visual function. This study will also assess the relationship of glycemic variability, as measured by continuous glucose monitoring with DR outcomes.

The general objective is to provide the first-in-human experimental demonstration that the combination of platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy with atezolizumab and WT1/DC vaccination is feasible and safe, has clinical activity and enables the induction of mesothelioma-specific immune responses in patients with MPM.",
    "detailed_description": "Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly aggressive and in virtually all cases fatal cancer that is tightly associated with prior asbestos exposure. Despite some improvement over time, the prognosis of patients diagnosed with MPM remains dismal with a median overall survival from diagnosis of only 9-16 months.\n\nIn this single arm phase I/II trial the investigators want to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of integrating the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor atezolizumab and WT1-targeted dendritic cell vaccination in epitheloid MPM patients in conjunction with first line platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. In addition, chemo-immunotherapy-induced immunogenicity will be studied and patient's clinical outcome will be documented for comparison with current patient's outcome allowing indication of the added value.\n\nFifteen patients diagnosed with histologically proven epithelial MPM (stage I-IV) will be included. Patients should be able to undergo leukapheresis, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Patients who underwent prior treatment for MPM or with a history of another malignancy within the last three years will be excluded.\n\nThe intention of this study is to administer four 3-weekly (\u00b13 days) platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy cycles (CT1-4) combined with atezolizumab treatments (A1-4) and autologous WT1 messenger (m)RNA-loaded dendritic cells (V1-4) at day 0 and day 14 (\u00b13 days) of each chemotherapy cycle, respectively.\n\nAdditional atezolizumab doses and/or WT1/DC vaccines after the chemo-immunotherapy study scheme can be administered to the patient if consent for continuation of atezolizumab treatment and/or WT1/DC vaccination was obtained and residual WT1/DC vaccine aliquots are available. In that case, atezolizumab and/or WT1/DC vaccines will be administered on a 4-weekly basis (\u00b11 week). The WT1/DC vaccines will be administered within 1 week after atezolizumab administration.\n\nAfter the final WT1/DC vaccination and/or atezolizumab administration, patients will enter a follow-up phase that lasts for up to 90 days after final WT1/DC vaccination and/or atezolizumab administration or 24 months after diagnosis, whichever occurs later.",

Atezolizumab is approved as standard of care treatment for adult patients with urothelial cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, extensive-stage small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and triple negative breast cancer. This means it has gone through clinical trials and been approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK.\n\nAtezolizumab works in patients with these types of cancers which have certain changes in the cancer cells called high tumour mutational burden (TMB) or high microsatellite instability (MSI) or proven (previously diagnosed) constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD).\n\nInvestigators now wish to find out if it will be useful in treating patients with other cancer types which are also TMB/MSH-high or show CMMRD. If the results are positive, the study team will work with the NHS and the Cancer Drugs Fund to see if these drugs can be routinely accessed for patients in the future.\n\nThis trial is part of a trial programme called DETERMINE. The programme will also look at other anti-cancer drugs in the same way, through matching the drug to rare cancer types or ones with specific mutations.",

Sub-cohorts may be defined and further expanded to a target of 30 evaluable patients each.\n\nThe ultimate aim is to translate positive clinical findings to the NHS (Cancer Drugs Fund) to provide new treatment options for rare adult, paediatric and TYA cancers.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPre-screening: The Molecular Tumour Board makes a treatment recommendation for the participant based on molecularly-defined cohorts.\n\nScreening: Consenting patients undergo biopsy and collection of blood samples for research purposes.\n\nTreatment: Patients will receive atezolizumab until disease progression without clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. Patients will also undergo collection of blood samples at various intervals while receiving treatment and at EoT.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.\n\nTHE DETERMINE TRIAL MASTER (SCREENING) PROTOCOL:\n\nPlease see DETERMINE Trial Master (Screening) Protocol record (NCT05722886) for information on the DETERMINE Trial Master Protocol and applicable documents.",

    "detailed_description": "Especially for diseases that are not curable such as metastatic breast cancer (MBC), the maintenance of quality of life is one of the main aims of treatments. Adverse events are well-known side effects of any cytostatic treatment and impact the patients' quality of life. Therefore, new treatment options are developed that should stop or at least slow down metastatic spread of cancer without causing negative side effects in terms of high-grade adverse events. For patients with hormone-receptor positive and HER2 positive MBC the combination of HER2-targeted therapy with endocrine therapy has already been proven to be an effective and in many cases valuable alternative to the combination of HER2-targeted therapy with chemotherapy. The high relevance of HER2-neu-targeted/endocrine treatment combinations derives from the fact that potential chemotherapy-related toxicity can be avoided, which in turn positively affects quality of life. Clinical trials suggest an additional benefit when a CDK4/6 inhibitor is added to the combination of endocrine therapy and anti HER2 treatment. DETECT V is a randomized phase III study comparing the safety and efficacy of trastuzumab plus pertuzumab and the CDK 4/6 inhibitor ribociclib in combination with either endocrine therapy or chemotherapy.",

A non-clinical study of CDH1 synthetic lethality interactions has identified ROS1 as a potential target. In vivo, ROS1 inhibitors produced profound antitumor effects in multiple models of E-cadherin-defective breast cancer, providing the preclinical rationale for assessing ROS1 inhibitors in this setting. Endocrine therapy being the mainstay of therapy for ER+/HER2- ILBC and the pre-operative setting offering a platform for rapid drug evaluation and biomarker research, the ROSALINE phase 2 study will evaluate the efficacy of Entrectinib (a potent inhibitor of ROS1 among other targets) in combination with letrozole (+ goserelin in premenopausal women) in the early setting of ILBC (stages 1 to 3). The neoadjuvant therapy will last 4 months and post-operative therapy will follow local practice. Biomarker research will include RNA sequencing of initial biopsies and surgical specimens, as well as liquid biopsies.",
    "detailed_description": "The neoadjuvant setting has been the target of increasing interest recently, as it offers the possibility of direct evaluation of treatment effect on tumour size, better surgical results as well as for the possible research opportunities it provides via the comparative analysis of tumour biology and clinical outcomes before and after treatment.\n\nInvasive lobular breast cancer (ILBC) is the second most common histologic subtype (5-15%) after invasive ductal breast cancer (IDBC). Despite clinical and pathologic differences, ILBC is still treated as IDBC. Indeed, subjects with ILBC tend to have lower response rates to conventional chemotherapeutic agents and some results have suggested that they might derive increased benefit with aromatase inhibitors.\n\nCDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with endocrine therapy are FDA-approved for the treatment of ER-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer following the results of 7 positive phase 3 trials. These agents are currently tested in phase 3 studies in the adjuvant setting and might achieve the status of standard of care for subjects with ER-positive/HER2-negative early breast cancer treated with curative intent. In the NeoPAL (UCBG10/4, NCT02400567) neoadjuvant randomized study, Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) 0-1 status was achieved for 7.7% of subjects in the letrozole + palbociclib arm. This rate is not available for the 7 subjects with lobular breast cancer enrolled in this arm.\n\nIn lobular breast cancer, loss of E-cadherin (CDH1) expression is the most frequent oncogenic event and is present in 90% of cases. In vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo model systems as well as different functional profiling modalities (genetic and chemical screens) have been used to identify CDH1 synthetic lethality interactions. In vivo, ROS1 inhibitors produced profound antitumor effects in multiple models of E-cadherin-defective breast cancer, providing the preclinical rationale for assessing ROS1 inhibitors in this setting. A study is currently investigating this hypothesis in ER+/HER2- metastatic lobular breast cancer (NCT03620643).\n\nEntrectinib is a potent small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets oncogenic rearrangements in NTRK, ROS1, and ALK. In vitro, entrectinib potently ROS1 at low nanomolar concentrations, with an average median inhibitory concentration of 0.007 \u03bcM against ROS1.\n\nThis single arm, multi-center, phase 2 trial will include pre and post-menopausal women with ER-positive/HER2-negative early stage invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast to evaluate the effect of combining endocrine therapy with entrectinib. Subjects will receive four 28-day cycles of letrozole 2.5 mg daily in combination with entrectinib 600 mg daily. Pre-menopausal women will receive goserelin 3.6 mg every 28 days.\n\nSubjects' response to therapy will be evaluated at screening, after 2 cycles and after the 4 cycles of treatment by breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An ECG will be performed at screening and then before cycle 2. Surgery will take place after at least 16 weeks of treatment, during week 18 (+ 7-day window). Breast and axillary surgery will follow local practice.\n\nPost-operative therapy will be at the discretion of the investigator and will follow local practice.",

Clinical results suggests a similar situation for stage III malignancy. Siwemilar to other checkpoint inhibitors (CPI), the PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab demonstrated impressive activity and good tolerability in patients with metastatic dMMR CRC. Recently, the randomized phase III Keynote-177 trial was presented. In Keynote-177, patients with dMMR metastatic CRC were randomized to the PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab or to chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab as per Investigator's choice). Pembrolizumab treatment resulted in a statistically significant prolongation of Progression-free survival . In addition, side effects were lower with pembrolizumab and quality of life was improved compared to conventional chemotherapy. Thus, pembrolizumab will become the new standard of care in patients with dMMR metastatic CRC in first-line therapy.",

This study compares tissue based and liquid based testing to evaluate the detection rate and cost consequence of using this new tool in BC.",
    "detailed_description": "Part A - Simultaneous - Patients will be randomized 1:1 to FoundationOne liquid CDx or no additional testing simultaneously at initiation of request for standard based tissue based next generation sequencing (NGS) panel testing. The objective of Part A is to evaluate the cost-consequence of the liquid ctDNA biopsy technology, FoundationOne liquid CDx, for first line molecular characterization of advanced colorectal cancer, melanoma, non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, prostate cancer and triple negative breast cancer with simultaneous molecular characterization by tissue based NGS panel\n\nPart B - Sequential - Patients will undergo standard tissue based NGS panel testing and if there are no somatic tier 1 variant of strong clinical significance identified the patients will then be eligible for FoundationOne liquid CDx. The objective of Part B is to determine the benefit of a sequential approach with molecular characterization by tissue based NGS panel testing followed by liquid based FoundationOne liquid CDx for patients who do not have an actionable tissue based oncogenic driver, across British Columbia.\n\nThe development and access to next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies on tumour tissue and blood allows the ability to profile the genomic landscape of the tumour within reasonable turn-around times and costs. The promise of precision oncology is the ability to 'match the right drug to the right patient at the right time'. Despite considerable excitement at the prospect of genome-informed therapy to improve oncologic outcomes, there has been little empirical assessment of its benefit from an overall population perspective and its true impact on cancer care delivery in 'real-world' scenarios.\n\nWhile the enthusiasm for liquid biopsies has increased, the understanding of the cost implications lags behind. We propose to assess the true clinical impact on both individual patients and on a population-based cancer system of precision oncology via ctDNA analyses in metastatic solid tumors in a real-world scenario.",

    "brief_summary": "This is a prospective, non-randomized clinical trial that aims to describe the efficacy and toxicity of commercially available, targeted anticancer drugs\\* prescribed for treatment of patients with advanced cancer with a potentially actionable variant as revealed by a genomic or protein expression test. The study also aims to simplify patient access to approved targeted therapies that are contributed to the program by collaborating pharmaceutical companies and to perform next generation sequencing on tumor biopsies for biomarker analyses. Eligible patients have an advanced solid tumor, multiple myeloma or B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma for which standard treatment options are no longer available and acceptable performance status and organ function. A genomic or protein expression test must have been performed on the tumor and the results must identify at least one potentially actionable molecular variant as defined in the protocol. Results from the molecular profiling test will be used to determine an appropriate drug(s) from among those available in the protocol. The choice of drug will be supported by a list of potential profiles, a molecular tumor board, a knowledge library and by study coordinators for review and approval of the match. The protocol-specified treatment will be administered to the patient once any drug-specific eligibility criteria are confirmed and a fresh pre-treatment biopsy is performed for future genetic studies. All patients who receive treatment with a drug available in the protocol will be followed for standard efficacy outcomes including tumor response, progression-free and overall survival as well as duration of treatment. In addition, treatment related toxicity will be evaluated.",
    "detailed_description": "Problem description: evidence is building that matching targeted agents to tumor characteristics can improve outcomes. Such reports have fueled interest among patients and physicians to use molecular testing for treatment planning when standard treatment options have been exhausted. When oncologists aim to provide such personalized treatment to their patients though, obtaining the drugs can be challenging since off-label prescribing, while legal, is generally not reimbursed by insurance companies. Furthermore, outcomes of off-label treatment in routine clinical practice are not systematically recorded. As a result, the research and clinical communities have limited insight in these outcomes, leading to repetitive use of ineffective treatment for some tumor types, while effective treatment strategies might be missed for others. The latter is especially relevant for 'orphan diseases', that are too rare to conduct formal phase II and III trials. In summary, there is a lack of access to potentially effective therapy on one hand, and a lack of knowledge on broader use of such therapies on the other, altogether leading to sub-optimal use of available resources.\n\nEnvisioned solution and study aim: creation of a drug-access program, in which patients are treated with registered targeted therapy matched to their molecular tumor profile, and in which the outcomes of such therapies are recorded systematically, per tumor profile and tumor type (this is important since it is becoming increasingly clear that the tissue of origin is an important determinant of outcome of genetic abnormalities). We hereby aim to improve and broaden the use of registered targeted therapy, whilst facilitating patient access to such therapy.\n\nPlan of investigation: patients will be treated with approved targeted agents, selected based on results of a molecular profiling test of the patient's tumor. Eligible patients will have exhausted standard treatment options, and their tumor must harbor a potentially actionable molecular variant as defined in the protocol. The study will provide a tumor board to help physicians understand the profiling test results and treatment options, and will enable insights about the utility of this approach. In addition, next generation sequencing will be performed on fresh tumor biopsies for additional biomarker discovery. Patients from the Netherlands and the USA will be included in two similar though independent protocols (DRUP and TAPUR), allowing data-exchange and empowering of both trials.\n\nExpected outcome: early signs of clinical activity of approved drugs outside their label, providing effective personalized treatment options, improved patient outcomes and access to targeted therapy.",

TNBC can be divided into at least two molecular entities; BRCA-like and non-BRCA-like. In this trial we would like to investigate whether a molecular subgroup exists within TNBCs that derives a benefit from atezolizumab added to first line chemotherapy.",
    "detailed_description": "Atezolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets human programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has shown activity in TNBC. Early clinical trials with anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy have shown that the median duration to response in TNBC is remarkably long (18 weeks) compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Since advanced TNBC is characterized by rapid disease progression, most patients with TNBC may not have the opportunity to derive benefit from immunotherapy. We hypothesize that by combining atezolizumab with paclitaxel or carboplatin-cyclophosphamide the desired rapid tumor control will be obtained with chemotherapy and subsequently atezolizumab can result in durable responses in a significant subset of patients. It is unknown whether addition of atezolizumab to first line chemotherapy in TNBC is more beneficial than adding this antibody to a second line treatment schedule. Because of this and because of the poor outcome of patients with advanced TNBC experiencing disease progression after first line palliative chemotherapy, patients who were randomized to a chemotherapy only arm in this study will be offered the opportunity to cross over to the other chemotherapy regimen plus atezolizumab at disease progression.",

The potential synergistic cardiotoxicity of trastuzumab and anthracyclines has led to the development of non-anthracycline containing regimens, which have shown high pathologic complete response rates. Anthracyclines remain very active in HER2 positive breast cancer, however, and increasing evidence now supports safe combination of trastuzumab and epirubicin. Therefore, the addition of epirubicin to a non-anthracycline containing regimen may further improve outcome for patients with HER2 positive breast cancer.\n\nSeveral reports confirmed benefit of dual HER2 blockade by adding pertuzumab to a trastuzumab containing neoadjuvant regimen. The results of the combined treatment in the Neosphere study, however, are similar to what we found in a phase II trial using a weekly paclitaxel, trastuzumab, carboplatin combination with pCR rates of approximately 44%. Adding pertuzumab to this regimen is likely to also increase the high pCR rate and to add substantial benefit to patients.",

This pilot will test if SCS can show evidence to improve motor deficits in people with type 3 or 4 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The investigators will enroll up to six subjects with Type 3 or 4 SMA aged 16 or older that show quantifiable motor deficits of the legs but are able to stand independently. The investigators will then implant the subjects with percutaneous, bilateral, linear spinal leads near the lumbar spinal cord for a period of up to 29 days. Although these leads are not optimized for motor function but rather for their clinically approved indication of treating pain, the investigators believe they provide a safe technology enabling our team to perform scientific measurement necessary to evaluate potential for effects of SCS in motor paralysis with SMA. After the end of the study, the leads will be explanted.",

    "detailed_description": "Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and aggressive cancer arising from the mesothelial surface of the pleura. In Europe, the incidence is about 20 per million and is almost always caused by asbestos exposure, with a usual lag time of 30 years between exposure and presentation. Patients diagnosed with advanced MPM have limited treatment options, representing a strict unmet need. Despite decades of clinical research, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains one of the few therapeutic options that has been proven to improve survival in advanced MPM in a randomised controlled trial.\n\nThe combination of cisplatin and pemetrexed has become standard first-line therapy worldwide for patients who are not suitable for aggressive surgery or in whom chemotherapy is recommended as part of a multimodality regimen. Carboplatin is often substituted for cisplatin, due to simpler and shorter administration and assumption of a more favourable toxicity profile based on experience in other diseases. Patients with MPM have limited treatment options, representing a strict unmet need.\n\nAn antibody is a common type of protein usually made in the body in response to a foreign substance. Antibodies attack foreign substances and protect against infection. The two monoclonal antibodies (atezolizumab and bevacizumab) used in this trial are laboratory-produced antibodies. Atezolizumab is engineered to attach to immune cells to stimulate their activity against cancer cells.\n\nAtezolizumab and bevacizumab are both approved by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of lung and other cancers. The addition of atezolizumab to bevacizumab plus standard chemotherapy for the treatment of MPM is being investigated in this trial.\n\nAll participants will receive 4-6 cycles of standard chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin AUC 5 (area under the plasma concentration versus time curve) plus pemetrexed 500mg/m\\^2 given intravenously, on day 1 of every 3 week cycle for about 12 to 18 weeks.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups:\n\nTreatment 1\n\n* Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously on day 1 of every 3-week cycle, plus\n* 4-6 cycles of chemotherapy\n\nOR\n\nTreatment 2\n\n* Atezolizumab 1200 mg fixed dose intravenously on day 1 of every 3-week cycle, plus\n* Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg, intravenously on day 1 of every 3-week cycle, plus\n* 4-6 cycles of chemotherapy\n\nParticipants will continue to receive treatment until disease progression, or until treatment is stopped at the request of the participant or treating doctor, or the participant withdraws consent.\n\nA total of 400 participants from approximately 45 centres in Europe are expected to be included in this trial which will take approximately 6 years to be completed after the first participant is enrolled.",

Several cancer centers and programs have initiated this type of molecular profiling across Canada, with the goal to identify 'druggable' changes in tumors to find matching therapy for patients. These include initiatives in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. The CAnadian Profiling and Targeted agent Utilization tRial (CAPTUR) will test the activity of a list of commercially available targeted agents in patients who have undergone tumor profiling and have 'druggable' changes identified in their cancers.",

    "detailed_description": "Basket studies are a new sort of clinical studies to identify patients with the same kind of mutations and treat them with the same drug, irrespective of their specific cancer type. In basket studies, depending on the mutation types, patients are classified into \"baskets\". Targeted therapies that block that mutation are then identified and assigned to baskets where patients are treated accordingly.\n\nThis protocol has two parts: part A (iPROFILER), which includes the common procedures for tumor molecular profiling and treatment recommendation, and part B (iBASKET), which corresponds to the therapeutic portion.\n\nThe purpose of part A (iPROFILER) of this study is to test participants' tumour tissue in order to identify whether their tumour has certain mutations in cancer-related genes. It is known that gene mutations of tumours contribute to their origin and growth and determine whether the tumour will respond to particular cancer drugs. This test will provide information about potential targeted therapies that specifically attack those gene mutations. The purpose of part B (iBASKET) of this study is to offer participants a personalised anti-cancer treatment based on the gene mutations that are found in their tumour.\n\nParticipants taking part in module 1 of part B (iBASKET) will receive atezolizumab 1200 mg IV every 3 weeks, following the analysis of their tumour in part A (iPROFILER). Participants will be able to take atezolizumab for as long as their tumour doesn't grow and for as long as they don't have any side-effects which prevent them from continuing treatment. Module 1 will have a 2-year recruitment period. The aim of the study is to determine which genomically selected populations respond effectively to the targeted treatment, atezolizumab. Approximately 1000 participants will be enrolled into part A (iPROFILER), with approximately 120 participants being recruited into module 1 of part B (iBASKET).\n\nParticipants taking part in module 2 of part B (iBASKET) will receive will receive futibatinib, 20 mg, once daily (QD) in 28-day cycles, following the analysis of their tumour in part A (iPROFILER).

The immunochemotherapy DRC (dexamethasone, rituximab, cyclophosphamide) was shown to be highly effective in patients with WM without inducing major hematological toxicities. On the other hand the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib showed substantial activity as a single agent in WM with only very few side effects when given in a weekly schedule. Recent data confirmed high activity with low toxicity for ibrutinib in relapsed WM patients as single agent therapy. Based on these observations it is the aim of this study to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of the chemotherapy-free combination bortezomib, rituximab, ibrutinib (B-RI) in treatment na\u00efve WM patient.",
    "detailed_description": "In Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia (WM) conventional chemotherapy induces only low complete remission (CR) rates and responses of short duration compared to other indolent lymphomas. Thus innovative approaches are needed which combine excellent activity and tolerability in patients with WM, who are mostly of advanced age. Today, chemotherapy in combination with the anti-cluster of differentiation (CD) 20 antibody rituximab is still the backbone of treatment in patients with WM and is recommended as first line in national and international treatment guidelines. With the approval of Ibrutinib by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 2015 for patients with relapsed WM or for patients not eligible for chemotherapy with treatment na\u00efve WM treatment landscape has changed in this lymphoma subtype and there is an urgent need to evaluate to which extent chemotherapy-free approaches add clinical benefit to the patient. The treatment in the \"European Consortium for Waldenstr\u00f6m's Macroglobulinemia\" (ECWM)-2 trial will test, whether the chemotherapy-free approach, which is given orally (ibrutinib) and subcutaneously (bortezomib and rituximab from cycle 2 onwards) (B-RI) will approach the efficacy of chemotherapy containing treatment concepts, but avoids chemotherapy associated toxicity. From the perspective of single agent ibrutinib, this regimen tests whether ibrutinib can be further optimized by adding rituximab and bortezomib. The combination of rituximab and ibrutinib was tested in comparison to rituximab/placebo in a large international phase III trial on behalf of the European Consortium for Waldenstr\u00f6m's Macroglobulinemia in relapsed and first line WM, and results were recently published: in this trial no unexpected toxicity of the combination ibrutinib/rituximab was reported. Furthermore, ibrutinib/rituximab was significantly superior to rituximab/placebo with regard to response rates and PFS. From the perspective of the established rituximab/bortezomib regimen, the combination of B-RI will evaluate whether adding ibrutinib to this combination will add any benefit for the patient.\n\nTo this end, the aim of the study is to assess the toxicity and efficacy of B-RI in an exploratory phase II trial.",

Independent of previous treatment response, Rituximab-Intolerant patients require a safe and effective therapeutic alternative that could reduce the risk of hypersensitivity reactions. On the other end a substantial proportion of patients do not benefit of rituximab therapy and might benefit of other anti CD20 monoclonal antibodies. A few patients transiently benefit of rituximab but their relapses after rituximab administration are so frequent that they spend most of their live with nephrotic range proteinuria (rituximab-dependent patients). Obinutuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody with enhanced B cell-depleting potential. Due to humanization and glycoengineering, this drug may be safe and effective in inducing disease remission even in patients with prior hypersensitivity reactions to rituximab. Moreover, it has been found to be effective in patients with membranous nephropathy who failed to respond to rituximab.",

First to investigate the feasibility of whether a remotely administered smartphone app can increase the volume and intensity of physical activity in daily life in individuals with a LRRK2 G2019S or GBA1 N370S genetic mutation over a long period of time (24 months). Second, to explore the preliminary efficacy of exercise on markers for prodromal Parkinson's disease progression in individuals with a LRRK2 G2019S or GBA1 N370S genetic mutation.\n\nParticipants will be tasked to achieve an incremental increase of daily steps (volume) and amount of minutes exercised at a certain heart rate (intensity) with respect to their own baseline level. Motivation with regards to physical activity will entirely be communicated through the study specific Slow Speed smartphone app. A joint primary objective consists of two components. First to determine the longitudinal effect of an exercise intervention in LRRK2 G2019S or GBA1 N370S variant carriers on a prodromal load score, comprised of digital biomarkers of prodromal symptoms. The secondary component of the primary outcome is to determine the feasibility of a remote intervention study. The secondary objective is the effect of a physical activity intervention on digital markers of physical fitness. Exploratory outcomes entail retention rate, completeness of remote digital biomarker assessments, digital prodromal motor and non-motor features of PD. Using these biomarkers, we aim to develop a composite score (prodromal load score) to estimate the total prodromal load. An international exercise study with fellow researchers in the United Kingdom are currently in preparation (Slow-SPEED-UK) and active in the Netherlands (Slow-SPEED-NL). Our intention is to analyse overlapping outcomes combined where possible through a meta-analysis plan, to obtain insight on (determinants of) heterogeneity in compliance and possible efficacy across subgroups",
    "detailed_description": "Rationale: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the fastest growing neurodegenerative disease. Exercise beneficially effects motor symptoms and neuroplasticity in people with PD. However, disease-slowing interventions have been ineffective in clinically manifest PD, when pathology is already advanced, but could succeed in prodromal PD, when pathology is limited. People with a LRRK2 G2019S or GBA1 N370S genetic mutation have an increased risk to develop clinically manifest PD. Therefore, this group is likely to develop prodromal PD. This study will take an important step forward by studying the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of long-term physical activity on prodromal symptoms and disease progression in people with prodromal PD using a newly developed, fully remote smartphone-based app. The app is inspired by the app used in the STEPWISE trial (NCT04848077) and currently used in Slow-SPEED-NL (NCT06193252).\n\nObjective: The joint primary objective has two components. First, to evaluate the long-term (36-month) impact of an exercise intervention on a prodromal load score in individuals carrying the LRRK2 G2019S or GBA1 N370S variants. This score will be derived from digital biomarkers capturing both motor and non-motor prodromal symptoms. Using these biomarkers, we aim to develop a composite prodromal load score to estimate the overall burden of prodromal features.\n\nThe secondary component of the primary outcome is to determine the feasibility of a long-term (36 months) remote intervention study expressed as longitudinal change in digital measures of physical activity (step count) measured using a Fitbit smartwatch.\n\nOur secondary objective is the potential group effect on physical fitness. Thirdly, we investigate whether the intervention, prodromal motor- and non-motor symptoms can be assessed remotely in a digital, decentralized fashion.\n\nCurrently blood- and imaging biomarkers are not incorporated as outcome measures. We intend to add these biomarkers pending appropriate funding.\n\nStudy design: Double-blind randomized controlled trial\n\nStudy population: A total of 600 English speaking individuals living in the United States of America with a LRRK2 G2019S or GBA1 N370S genetic mutation aged 50 years and older, who are in possession of a suitable smartphone without mobility hampering conditions and absence of cognitive impairment which impedes usage of a smartphone will be recruited. Participant recruitment will primarily target individuals from the 23andMe customer base. Enrollment and onboarding of study participants will be supported by research staff at the University of Rochester.\n\nIntervention: Participants will be randomized to a group (1:1 ratio) and will be motivated to increase the volume and intensity of physical activity based on their own baseline level. Baseline physical activity levels will be determined during a 4-week period. The two groups differ in the amount of physical activity that they are tasked to achieve.",

    "detailed_description": "Giant cell arteritis (GCA) in the elderly is considered a medical emergency in case of ischemic complication, urgent treatment is needed and high doses of intravenous steroids are used. To date, usual treatments added to steroids have not been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of ischemic event recurrence in GCA.\n\nRecently, the efficacy of tocilizumab has been demonstrated as a steroid-sparing agent and a long-term complete remission agent. The aim of this study is to address the potential benefits of tocilizumab as induction therapy in combination with high dose steroids to improve the neurovascular involvement in GCA.\n\nThe study will enroll 66 subjects with GCA (according to ACR criteria or positive temporal artery biopsy) and neurovascular involvement (symptomatic or asymptomatic). It consist of a screening phase (up to 30 days), a baseline/randomization phase and a treatment phase with experimental treatment or placebo (weekly administrated) which could be combined with usual treatments for stroke as antiaggregants and/or anticoagulants (24 weeks). Regular visit will be performed to follow the GCA remission, adverse treatments effects and proceed to radiological and biological evaluations (visit assessment at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36) until end of study visit at week 52.",

    "detailed_description": "In the CLL2-BAG-trial, a total of 62 patients of an allcomer CLL population (irrespective of physical fitness, previous therapies and prognostic factors) with an indication for treatment will be included. Patient will receive 2 cycles of debulking treatment with Bendamustine unless contraindications (e.g. refractoriness) are present or a debulking is not indicated due to a low tumor load. Afterwards, 6 cycles of induction treatment with GA101 (obinutuzumab, 3 doses in the first cycle and monthly in cycles 2-6) and ABT-199 (venetoclax, continuously starting in cycle 2 with a low dose escalation) will be applied. The primary endpoint overall response rate will be assessed at final restaging (2 months after end of induction treatment). Patients benefitting from treatment receive further therapy with GA101 (3 monthly) and ABT-199 (continuously) in a maintenance phase for up to 24 months. Maintenance treatment will be stopped in case of achievement of a complete remission and confirmation of MRD (minimal residual disease) negativity in peripheral blood or if unacceptable toxicity or progression occurs.\n\nSince the results of the primary endpoint analysis of the CLL2-BAG trial were very promising and this trial is one of the first studies evaluating the combination of venetoclax and obinutuzumab, it is scientifically very important to follow these first patients treated with this combination as long as possible. Therefore, with amendment 4 and 5, an extended follow-up for all patients willing to continue their study participation was implemented as well as the possibility of a re-treatment with venetoclax and obinutuzumab (but without a prior bendamustine debulking) in case of a progression.",

After being informed about the study, and the potential risks, patients who consent to participate undergo a 21-day screening period to determine study eligibility. Patients will be prospectively selected into subgroups based on their tumour characteristics.\n\nOnce eligibility is confirmed, tiragolumab alone is administered at Cycle 1 Day 1 (day 1 of study). Commencing from Cycle 2 Day 1, tiragolumab and atezolizumab are administered at 21-day cycles until treatment discontinuation, with or without disease progression.\n\nParticipants undergo a biopsy at cycle 2 prior to commencement of atezolizumab treatment. Standard imaging scans (usually computed tomography (CT)) are performed throughout the trial. Patients also undergo blood, urine and stool sample collection on study.\n\nOnce participants discontinue treatment, a study visit is performed within 30 days of the end of the final treatment cycle. If treatment cessation is not contemporaneous with disease progression, follow-up calls are conducted every 9 weeks until disease progression. Once disease progression occurs, a study visit is performed within 30 days of disease progression and then every 3 months until 12 months after the final participant discontinues study treatment.\n\nActive follow-up of all participants will continue until death or 12 months after the last participant discontinues study treatment, whichever occurs first.

    "detailed_description": "Following inform consent form (ICF) signature, a formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor block (archival or a dedicated freshly collected tumor biopsy) will be collected for all enrolled patients and centralized at the biological resources platform of the Centre L\u00e9on B\u00e9rard.\n\nAt reception, a central pathological review will be performed to confirm if quality and quantity of material is acceptable: all tumor sample should present at least 20 % (ideally 30 %) of tumor cells and have a surface area \\> 5 mm2 (optimal condition is a surface area of 5-25 mm2). If the quality and quantity of tumor sample do not meet the standards, patients will be considered as \"screening failure\". If standards are met, inclusion will be confirmed and molecular screening will be initiated as well as the translational research program.\n\nThe molecular screening to detect NTRK1,2,3, ROS1 or ALK gene rearrangements will be a two-step process, consisting of :\n\n1. First, immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay to detect protein expression of TRKA/B/C (encoded by NTRK1,2,3), ROS1 or ALK. Only positive IHC samples will continued the 2nd step of molecular screening. Negative IHC patients do not require further NTRK, ROS or ALK gene rearrangement testing; however tumor samples will be further used for additional translational research program presented in Section VII and data about the clinical evolution of these patients will be collected\n2. Second, RNAseq analysis will be performed on positive IHC specimens to detect specific rearrangements in the NTRK1,NTRK2, NTRK3, ROS1 or ALK genes.\n3. Following molecular analyses, screening results will be immediately (within 24 hours) communicated to investigators, GSF-GETO Network and Ignyta representatives in order to recommend patients with NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, ROS1 or ALK rearrangement for formal eligibility determination for potential enrolment in a clinical trial in particular with entrectinib (STARTRK-2; NCT02568267).",

Participants who meet the biomarker assessment criteria will follow the eligibility criteria assessment. Participants with HER2 positive disease that meet the eligibility criteria will be treated with neoadjuvant PHESGO\u2122.\n\nA baseline PET/CT will be performed prior to start of PHESGO\u2122 treatment. All participants will receive fixed-dose subcutaneous formulation with pertuzumab and trastuzumab (PHESGO\u2122) every 21 days for 3 cycles to evaluate PET/CT response.

For this cohort of participant, data regarding treatment received, pCR status and outcomes will be collected.\n\nDefinitive breast cancer surgery will be performed after the 8th cycle of therapy. After surgery, participants will receive adjuvant treatment according to their response. Participants achieving pCR will receive PHESGO\u2122 alone as adjuvant treatment to complete a total of one year of therapy, thus receiving 10 cycles of adjuvant PHESGO\u2122.

Atezolizumab is designed to stop a protein called PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) being expressed on the cancer, allowing the immune system to recognise the tumour cells as foreign bodies and attack them. Atezolizumab has been shown to have activity in urothelial cancer which has spread.\n\nThere two cohorts for this trial. One cohort will investigate the most common histological type of urothelial cancer (transitional cell carcinoma) outside the bladder, for example in the upper urinary tract. The other cohort will investigate rarer histological subtypes (such as such as squamous cell or adenocarcinoma) of urothelial cancer throughout the entire urinary system.\n\nThis study will be recruiting patients from hospitals in the UK, France and Spain. If a patient is eligible for the study and decides to take part, they will receive up to two 3-weekly cycles of atezolizumab. 4-8 weeks after being enrolled, the patient will have an operation to remove the bladder (cystectomy) or the kidney, ureter and part of the bladder (nephroureterectomy or distal ureteral resection) as per normal practice. Following surgery, they will attend three hospital visits (4,12 and 24 weeks after surgery) and their disease progress/survival will be followed over the next 2 years. The clinical team will compare the patient's tumour tissue samples,scan results and blood results from before and after treatment with atezolizumab in order to see how well the drug works and if it is safe. Many of the procedures involved in this study are offered as standard care and participation in this trial will not delay surgery.",

Following the completion of the induction part, PCI may be administered concurrently with atezolizumab and dendritic cell vaccination during the maintenance part. For those patients who have not progressed at the time of study drug discontinuation, the tumor assessments (including all disease locations) will be assessed radiologically by CT or MRI, as performed at screening, every 9 weeks (approximately 63 \u00b1 7 days), until the occurrence of PD or study completion.

By using PET imaging at baseline and at two years, we will investigate the neuroinflammation dynamics in sporadic AD and its consequences on neurodegenerative biomarkers as well as its clinical repercussions.\n\nConservative diagnosis criteria based on clinical and CSF biomarkers have been established to avoid risks of misdiagnosis for the patients. The controls will undergo, at inclusion, an additional PiB-PET imaging to avoid bias and to identify amyloid positive controls.\n\nA complete clinical and cognitive evaluation will accompany the image acquisition at baseline. The subjects will be followed up clinically at one year. At two years, another set of PET/MRIs will be performed as well as a cognitive evaluation.

    "detailed_description": "Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) is expressed in the majority of lung adenocarcinoma and has a clear prognostic value. Pemetrexed-based immunochemotherapy is a standard of care for advanced lung adenocarcinoma. However, real-world data suggest that TTF-1 negative patients might derive superior outcome using pemetrexed-free regimens. The aim of this study is to compare a pemetrexed-free (Arm A) vs. a pemetrexed-based immunochemotherapy (Arm B) as first-line treatment for metastatic TTF-1 negative lung adenocarcinoma without actionable genomic alterations.",

    "detailed_description": "This is a Phase 1 trial of atezolizumab in combination with ipatasertib. There are two parts to this study. Part A: dose escalation, and Part B: dose expansion.\n\nPart A:\n\nThe investigators will investigate the combination of a fixed dose of atezolizumab (1200mg) in combination with escalating doses of ipatasertib in patients with advanced solid tumours (Cohort A1) and patients with resectable glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Cohort A2).\n\nCohort A1 (advanced solid tumours):\n\nThere will be an ipatasertib run-in phase of 14 days of continuous oral dosing with paired pre and post-treatment blood and tissue samples. Combinations dosing will commence on Cycle 1 Day 1 with the atezolizumab infusion. Cycle 1 will therefore be 35 days. Only patients with advanced solid tumours recruited into Cohort A1 will be included in dose escalation decisions and determination of the MTD and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for part B.\n\nCohort A2 (potentially resectable GBMs):\n\nThere will be an ipatasertib run-in phase of at least 14 days and up to 21 days followed by surgical resection of the patient's tumour (5 day window for surgery). Ipatasertib dosing will be stopped 48 hours prior to surgery and combination dosing on Cycle1Day1 (C1D1) will commence after recovery. Accrual to Cohort A2 will run in parallel Cohort A1 without formal dose escalations and patients in Cohort A2 will not be included in dose escalation decisions for Cohort A1.\n\nRecruitment to Part A is complete.\n\nPart B:\n\nPatients will be enrolled into the expansion phase (Part B) to further characterize the tolerability of the RP2D (established in Cohort A1) of the combination in specific subgroups of patients. Part B of the study will have a pre-screening component for patients with solid tumours (Cohorts B1 and B2) to allow for enrichment for these specific subgroups of patients.\n\nPart B of the study will have three cohorts:\n\n* Cohort B1: patients with solid tumours with hyperactivation of PI3K pathway as determined by pathogenic mutations identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) (eg known activating mutations in PIK3CA, AKT1, AKT2) or PTEN loss (assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (n=12).\n* Cohort B2: patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer with PTEN loss as assessed by IHC (n=12)\n* Cohort B3: patients with glioblastoma (n=12) of which at least three (n=3) patients will have potentially resectable recurrent glioblastomas. Recruitment to cohort B3 is complete.\n* Cohort B4: patients with melanoma post progression on immune-checkpoint inhibitors (n=12)\n* Cohort B5: patients with other tumour types refractory to immune checkpoint inhibitors (where immune checkpoint inhibitors are licensed, e.g. bladder cancer, head and neck SCC, NSCLC) (n=12)\n* Cohort B6: patients with gynaecological cancers (including ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer) (n=12)\n\nApproximately 12 patients with solid tumours and 3 patients with glioblastoma will be entered into Part A of this trial and a further 72 patients will be enrolled into part B of the trial for an expected maximum of 87 patients on the study. If the MTD is reached in Part A with less than 15 patients enrolled, the investigators may enrol further patients at the R2PD in Part A to a maximum of 15 patients to include sufficient numbers of patients for the proof-of-concept translational studies. Additional subjects may be enrolled in a given cohort to ensure that the required number of evaluable subjects in each cohort is achieved.",

This is a Phase II study which will test whether this combination of drugs is effective and will provide further information on side effects and safety. A standard chemotherapy, gemcitabine, will be combined with 2 other drugs that target the HER2 receptor. The HER2 receptor is a growth protein on the surface of some breast cancer cells that provides messages telling the breast cancer cell to grow. The standard chemotherapy will be gemcitabine.. The other two drugs work against HER2. One is called trastuzumab (Herceptin) and it is commonly given to women with advanced and early HER2 positive breast cancer. The other drug, pertuzumab (Perjeta), is also given to women with advanced HER2 positive breast cancer. The drugs in this study are each individually approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. However, this study is looking at the effectiveness of gemcitabine with trastuzumab and pertuzumab when given to women who have advanced HER2 positive breast cancer who have had prior trastuzumab + pertuzumab or pertuzumab-based therapy.",

This study aims to determine if the information from the cancer genome analysis corresponds with the effects of atezolizumab on individuals and their cancer.\n\nThis is a Phase 2 study, which is undertaken after preliminary safety testing on a drug is completed, and will involve approximately 200 participants. Participants are assigned to one of 8 cohorts based on their primary tumour type: breast, lung, gastrointestinal (GI), primary unknown, genitourinary (GU), sarcoma, gynecological, and 'other' cancer types. Participants in all cohorts will receive the same dose of atezolizumab (1200 mg every 3 weeks). In the first stage for each cohort, 8 participants will be enrolled and if no participants respond to treatment, enrollment to that cohort will be closed. If 1 or more participants respond to treatment, up to 16 additional participants will be enrolled to that cohort. Participants continue on treatment until they no longer may benefit from the treatment or they decide to stop treatment.",

    "brief_summary": "To prevent hip fracture patients for having another fracture, secondary fracture preventing medication should be given as soon as possible. Zoledronate is the most efficient bisphosphonate and is given as an intravenous infusion once yearly. However, the appropriate time to initiate zoledronate treatment after a hip fracture has not yet been established. To clarify the optimal timing of zoledronate to hip fracture patients we have designed a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized non-inferiority trial to compare if zoledronate administered early (within 5 days) after hip fracture surgery is as good as zoledronate given late (3 months) after hip fracture surgery.",
    "detailed_description": "Hip fracture patients have the highest risk for recurrent hip or other osteoporotic fractures. We have efficient fracture preventing medication easily available, but few patients receive them. We therefore need to create simple systems to ensure that these frail patients with the highest risk for a new fracture are offered proper treatment early and any delay in treatment should be avoided. Zoledronate is the most efficient bisphosphonate and the drug of choice for hip fracture patients due to the results from the Horizon recurrent fracture trial. It is given as an intravenous infusion once yearly. However, the appropriate time to initiate zoledronate treatment after a hip fracture has not yet been established. The summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for Aclasta (zoledronate) in Norway says that Aclasta should not be administered within the first 2 weeks after the hip fracture, however there have been a practice over years in Norway to give zoledronate to the hip fracture patients during their stay in hospital for fracture treatment. There are logistical and practical advantages of giving zoledronate while the patient is still in hospital for her fracture. It has, however, been questioned whether the effect of zoledronate given within the first 2 weeks postoperatively really is fracture preventing. The results from the post hoc analysis from the Horizon recurrent fracture trial by Eriksen and co-workers in 2009, suggested that given zoledronate within 2-weeks after hip fracture surgery may be a little less fracture preventing. The results from this analysis can be due to the low number of study subjects as well as frailty in the study population causing the large variations. On the other hand, the lack of effect in the within 2-week group may be due to the affinity for zoledronate to bone mineral and the accumulation of zoledronate in the fracture callus during bone repair with less being incorporated in the rest of the skeleton.\n\nTo clarify the optimal timing of zoledronate to hip fracture patients we wanted to compare if zoledronate administered early (within 5 days) after hip fracture surgery, while the patients is still in hospital, is as good as zoledronate given late (3 months) after hip fracture surgery.\n\nTo test our hypothesis we designed a non-inferiority randomized trial using the bone turnover marker N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (P1NP) as the primary endpoint. PINP has in recent years been widely used as a marker to follow the effect of anti-resorptive therapy as it is more robust than the other well studied bone marker; cross-linked C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX). P1NP and CTX are recommended as reference markers for bone turnover by the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF). Anti-resorptive agents as bisphosphonates influence bone remodeling by decreasing bone resorption (amino-bisphosphonates kills osteoclasts) and thereby also reducing bone formation. This affects the bone turnover markers: Both P1NP and CTX drops in value in a consistent manner reflecting the level of bone suppression and has shown to correlate with the level of bone mineral density and the subsequent fracture risk. P1NP and CTX are therefore well suited to monitor the effect of anti-resorptive therapy as they reflect the bone turnover status in the entire skeleton. It is likely to believe that if zoledronate given early after fracture is accumulated in the fracture callus and too little is incorporated in the entire skeleton, the result will be just a local decrease in bone resorption (only in the fracture callus). This will not to the same extent as a decrease in bone resorption from the entire skeleton, be reflected by the bone turnover markers P1NP and CTX and the fall in these markers will be less than if we give zoledronate after the fracture has healed (after 6-12 weeks).\n\nEligible patients that meets the study requirements and with an informed consent will be stratified on type of operation (arthroplasty versus internal fixation) and on hospital before randomization 1:1 to either zoledronate early (ZOLearly: zoledronate given within 5 days after hip fracture surgery) or zoledronate late (ZOLlate: zoledronate given 3 months after hip fracture surgery). The patients will be followed for 15 months with study visits at 3 months post fracture and at 6 and 12 months post treatment with zoledronate. The study is double-blinded the first 3 months to be able to test for the \"soft\" secondary endpoints; delirium and rehabilitation. Approximately 300 patients will be recruited. Estimated recruitment time is 2 years.",

Patients are closely monitored using both Point-of-Care technology and hospital-based assessments, with the goal of enhancing GDMT adjustments. This approach is compared to standard care to determine its potential benefits in the management of HFrEF post-valve intervention.",
    "detailed_description": "Heart valve disease, with a current prevalence of 2.5% that rises with age, has been described as \"the next cardiac epidemic\", and is projected to double by 2040 and triple by 2060, paralleling population aging.\n\nThe period during and immediately after hospitalization for transcatheter valve intervention (TVI) in HFrEF patients (LVEF \u2264 40%) represents a \"vulnerable phase\" characterized by a high risk of death and re-hospitalization for acute HF. A study from the TVI registry demonstrated that, among 12.182 patients treated with TAVR in the United States, the rate of HF readmission at 1 year was 14.3% and the 1-year overall mortality was 23.7%.\n\nMoreover, the CHOICE-MI registry demonstrated that the primary combined endpoint of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalization at 1 year occurred in 39.2% of the Transcatheter mitral valve implantation (TMVI) patients, and in 28% in those TMVI-ineligible who undergoing bailout-TEER.\n\nRecently, the STRONG-HF trial demonstrated that rapid, intensive up-titration of guideline-directed therapy, coupled with close post-discharge follow-up, significantly enhances life quality and reduces 180-day mortality and heart failure readmission rates versus usual care.\n\nPrevious studies have additionally shown that a decrease in NT-proBNP levels during hospitalization for acute HF is associated with improved survival and reduced readmission rates. Patients whose NT-proBNP levels decrease by at least 30% tend to have a better prognosis compared to those with no significant change or an increase in levels. This suggests that a meaningful decrease in NT-proBNP levels can indicate successful response to HF treatment.\n\nConsequently, guiding HF therapy based on NT-proBNP levels can potentially improve clinical outcomes. For instance, adjusting medications to achieve a target NT-proBNP level may result in better control of HF symptoms and a lower risk of hospital readmission and mortality. This approach emphasizes the role of NT-proBNP as not just a diagnostic and prognostic tool but also as a therapeutic target in HF management. Overall, the use of NT-proBNP monitoring to guide medical therapy in HF patients supports a more personalized treatment strategy, potentially leading to rapid and effective decongestion, optimized therapy, and improved patient outcomes.\n\nHence, the primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of rapid up-titration of Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT) in patients with HFrEF undergoing transcatheter valvular intervention, supplemented by close follow-up visits and NT-proBNP measurements, using a hierarchical composite endpoint, which prioritize (1) all-cause mortality, (2) number of hospitalizations for heart failure, and (3) improvement in NT-proBNP, defined as a decrease of at least 30% from the baseline value.",

    "brief_summary": "INTRODUCTION: Approximately 44% of cancer survivors experience a deteriorated quality of life 5 years after diagnosis due to late onset of complications related to cancer treatments. The objective of the study is to evaluate the incidence rates of treatment-related complications, identify sub-clinical abnormalities and risk factors in patients participating in the PASCA post-treatment program.\n\nMETHOD: PASCA is a single-center, interventional cohort study of adult patients who received at least chemotherapy and with a complete remission to a testicular germ cell tumor, primary non-metastatic invasive breast carcinoma, high-grade soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, acute myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin's or aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Four assessment visits will be scheduled at 1 month (T1), 6 months (T2), 24 months (T3) and 60 months (T4) after completion of treatment. During these visits, 22 complications will be screened and follow-up care will be systematically offered to the health professional concerned by the complication in case of a positive result. The screening will contain the following elements: screening self-questionnaires, quality of life questionnaire, 12 biological parameters, a urinalysis evaluating hematuria, proteinuria, and leukocyturia, a spirometry, an electrocardiogram, 5 tests evaluating physical condition, vital signs and the perimetric measurement between both arms.\n\nDISCUSSION: This systematic screening could highlight a number of complications occurring after cancer treatments. Sub-clinical abnormalities and new risk factors could also be identified. This new organization of care could improve the quality of life of adult cancer survivors.",

    "brief_summary": "The present study will assess the effect and cost-effectiveness of the availability of point-of-care (POC) PCR testing, in respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in general practice, compared with usual care.",
    "detailed_description": "Background: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are frequent reasons for medical consultations and diagnostic accuracy is important to ensure appropriate treatment. It is important for the quality of the healthcare system that patients are diagnosed as fast as possible and that the GP and the patient are reassured about the diagnostic accuracy. If not, the patient may be unnecessarily concerned and contact health services again.\n\nRe-contacts are costly for society, but they may also be unsatisfactory to the patient and the clinician, because many re-contacts may indicate that tentative diagnosis or treatment were not successful and that in some cases the patient needs to contact health services again to get a sufficient answer or to be reassured that nothing is dangerous.\n\nThe introduction of POC PCR in primary care settings has demonstrated significant improvements in appropriate antibiotic prescription patterns in high income countries. In Denmark around 88 pct. of all prescription drugs are issued by general practice, as is the vast majority of the total antibiotics consumption in the healthcare system.\n\nAntibiotic overuse may lead to microbial resistance and if the overall consumption is not reduced, infections with resistant bacteria will be a major problem for both patients and healthcare systems. Due to diagnostic uncertainty, GPs may in some situations prescribe antibiotics also in cases where the patient's symptoms are caused by a viral infection.\n\nFurther, if antibiotics are not prescribed, the patient may reconsult their GP or the out-of-hours services due to feelings of uncertainty.\n\nAims: The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of POC PCR availability in general practice on 1) the number of re-contacts for patients with symptoms of RTIs, 2) the number of hospital admission, 3) deaths, 4) the number of redeemed antibiotic prescriptions, 5) costs, 6) health-related quality-of-life, 7) cost-effectiveness compared to usual care and 8) GP satisfaction.\n\nFurthermore, a qualitative process evaluation will be conducted throughout the trial.\n\nMethods This study is a cluster-randomized crossover, non-blinded superiority trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The procedure for randomization takes outset in the clinics' identification numbers as units. The trial consists of two periods of seven weeks (intervention and control). Care-as-usual is used as a comparator. The study is approved by the local regional ethics committee.\n\nThe effectiveness study and the cost-effectiveness study will be based on questionnaire data and data from the unique Danish national registries. Information from the different registers will be linked by the patients' Danish Personal Identification Number. Outcomes based on questionnaire data will be collected at baseline, day 7, 14 and day 28 after the initial visit.\n\nGP and patient recruitment:\n\nGeneral practices in 4 out of 5 Danish regions have been invited to participate. GPs have been invited through a written letter and regional newsletters sent to all GPs in Denmark in March 2023. The GPs has been assigned at random to start as intervention or control practice. Based on sample size calculation, the goal was to include 100 GP clinics.\n\nEach practice is asked to register all patients with symptoms of respiratory tract infections consecutively. The GPs are informed that it is entirely up to them and their clinical judgement to make a decision about whether or not they deem it relevant to employ the POC PCR-test device in the consultation with the patient.",

    "brief_summary": "There is no complete cure for SMA yet. However, the discovery of the genetic cause of SMA has led to the development of several treatment options that affect the genes involved in SMA - a gene replacement therapy called Zolgensma, and two drugs, called Nusinersen (Spinraza) and Risdiplam (Evyrsdi). In this context, the evaluation of efficacy and the long term follow-up of patients treated with these innovative treatments in clinical routine is one of the critical points. These evaluations are carried out in a medical context (clinical sites or research unit) using validated measurement tools and outcome measures. Carrying out these evaluations in a controlled environment can be considered from certain aspects as an advantage (reproducibility of measures, neutral environment, etc.), but also raises a certain number of questions regarding the impact on patients, the financial cost, or the relevance of the data obtained in an unnatural environment (stress, fatigue, patient motivation...). Also the regulatory authorities ask for longitudinal data for deciding to reimburse these expensive treatments. As such, the hospital cannot digest all these evaluations due to a lack of resources.",
    "detailed_description": "In the last few years, a number of therapeutic approaches have targeted a possible increase of the production of SMN protein in target motor neurons by genetic replacement of the defective SMN1 gene or by modifying pre-mRNA splicing in SMN2 to promote exon 7 inclusion by using an antisense oligonucleotide or small molecule drugs. Several clinical studies have focused on the evaluation of patients with SMA, whether they are ambulatory or not, adults, children or infants, treated or untreated.\n\nDepending on the SMA type, age or ambulatory status of the patients, different assessments (motor function scales or questionnaires) have provided consistent results to measure the evolution of the patients, such as HFMSE, MFM, RULM, 6MWT, MRC scale, Chop Intend or HINE.\n\nAs these evaluations are generally carried out in a controlled environment, they are likely to present an environmental bias. Even if studies are designed to anticipate and avoid most of these issues, different factors can influence patient test results (fatigue, motivation, stress, day to day variability...). From an economical point of view, the evaluation of patients in a controlled environment also has a significant cost, which heavily impact the global cost of clinical research or standard care (transport, patients' accommodation and care...). This factor is even more important as a significant proportion of the SMA population is non-ambulatory.\n\nNew treatments are indicated to treat SMA with a major impact on pre-existing disease standards of care and patients care pathway. In particular, there is no consensus on appropriate measures to monitor disease progression and treatment effect in a real-world setting. Such measures are critically needed to discuss treatment indication (treatment initiation criteria and stopping rules, therapeutic goals) and treatment monitoring. While patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) become more represented, objective functional measures are still required to assess SMA. In spite of the development of digital measures, no validated patient self-reported functional measures can be used as a surrogate. Thus, the objective disease assessment is currently based on validated outcome measures for SMA, similar to those used in clinical studies. As compared to clinical trials, the feasibility to administer these measures to SMA patients is challenging. Major limiting factors are: (1) the high disease-prevalence, (2) time-consuming measures, (3) the need for trained expert evaluators, and (4) limited access to hospital-based resources. In addition, the burden of affected individuals and caregivers has not been evaluated as well as patient treatment monitoring expectations. A refined approach using modern tools and fitting with patient real life environment is needed.",

    "detailed_description": "The patient population will be molecularly defined and include adult patients with newly diagnosed K27M-mutant histone-3.1 (H3.1K27M) or histone-3.3 (H3.3K27M) diffuse midline gliomas (DMG).\n\nWithin this trial, a long peptide vaccine containing a K27M-mutated histone-3 sequence, will be administered subcutaneously in addition to standard radiotherapy and thereafter in combination with the human anti-PD-L1 antibody Atezolizumab.\n\nFifteen patients (pts. 1-15) will receive 11 doses of H3K27M peptide vaccine in total starting with standard radiotherapy (RT) and 14 doses of the human anti-PD-L1 antibody Atezolizumab (every three weeks, q3w) starting four weeks after completion of RT. The first 3 vaccines will be given bi-weekly (q2w) in combination with RT. One dose of vaccination will be given at the beginning of recovery (RE) period following RT. Vaccines 5-11 (q6w) will be initiated with Atezolizumab after completion of RE. In a safety lead-in, the first three patients (pts. 1-3) will be enrolled sequentially.\n\nFollowing the last IMP administration, a safety / immunogenicity follow-up is planned for 24 weeks until end of study (EOS). To be able to assess safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the peptide vaccine in combination with Atezolizumab 15 evaluable patients will be enrolled.\n\nDiffuse gliomas of the thalamus, brain stem, spinal cord or other midline structures represent 3-4% of high-grade glioma and harbor H3.1K27M or H3.3K27M mutations as a characteristic founder mutation in \\> 70% of cases. H3K27M-mutant gliomas typically occur in children and adolescents but also in adult patients. After biopsy or resection, the standard of care consists of involved-field radiotherapy. Adding alkylating chemotherapy to radiotherapy does not offer additional benefit in retrospective case series and prospective clinical trials in children with pontine gliomas, probably as hypermethylation of the MGMT promoter in DMG is typically lacking. After radiotherapy gliomas frequently recur with a median 12-month progression-free survival of 20 %. Importantly, at recurrence particularly in the adult patient population, there is frequent distant progression and leptomeningeal dissemination, arguing for the necessity of systemic therapy upfront.\n\nFrom an immunological point of view H3K27M represents an attractive tumor antigen specifically expressed in tumor but not normal cells. Patients with H3K27M-mutant gliomas may harbor mutation-specific T cells, indicating that H3K27M is specifically presented to and recognized by the immune system in a mutation-specific manner. Vaccination of humanized mice with a long H3K27M vaccine results in an anti-tumor immune response effective in controlling H3K27M-expressing tumors in a preventive and a therapeutic manner without causing toxicity. In addition, eight adult patients with H3.3K27M-mutated gliomas were treated with an H3K27M 27 amino acid long peptide vaccine on a compassionate-use basis. None of the patients treated either with the peptide vaccine alone or in combination with an anti-human PD(L)-1 antibody showed any clinical or laboratory sign of treatment-related toxicity except for grade 1 injection site reactions. Importantly, all patients developed H3K27M-specific T cell responses with one patient of the combination treatment group showing long-term response with no sign of tumor progression for \\>24 months after vaccination and one patient experiencing complete response after pseudoprogression (unpublished observations). Based on these observations we hypothesize that checkpoint inhibition targeting PD-L1 is required for optimal amplification of a vaccine-induced H3K27M-specific T cell response.\n\nThe aim of this phase I trial is to evaluate the safety and immune response to the H3K27M peptide vaccine in combination with Atezolizumab in patients with H3K27M-mutant diffuse midline gliomas.",

This therapeutic agent also showed for the first time a significant reduction of disability progression in Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS) patients, whereas all other anti-inflammatory drugs had failed to do so in well-conducted studies. This raises the possibility that ocrelizumab, beyond its effects on the adaptive immune system activation underlying white matter lesions and clinical relapses, could beneficially influence other mechanisms involved in the progressive phase of the disease, such as the innate immune microglial cells activation, that has been described to persist in a diffuse manner in the Central Nervous system (CNS).

(A placebo is a drug that looks like the study drug but contains no medication.) The usual chemotherapy in this study is paclitaxel (WP) and carboplatin followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) or epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC). Usually, after neoadjuvant therapy and surgery for triple negative breast cancer, no additional treatment is given unless the cancer returns. This study will also look at continuing treatment after surgery with atezolizumab or the placebo. To be better, atezolizumab given with the neoadjuvant therapy should be better at: 1) decreasing the amount of tumor in the breast than the placebo given with the usual chemotherapy and 2) decreasing the chance of the cancer from returning after surgery.\n\nAnother purpose of this study is to test the good and bad effects of atezolizumab when added to the usual chemotherapy. Atezolizumab may keep your cancer from growing but it can also cause side effects.",
    "detailed_description": "NSABP B-59/GBG 96-GeparDouze is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, Phase III clinical trial. This is a collaborative study being conducted by NSABP Foundation, Inc. in partnership with the German Breast Group (GBG), and supported by funding by Genentech, a Member of the Roche Group, and F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd.\n\nIn this clinical trial of neoadjuvant and adjuvant administration of atezolizumab/placebo in patients with high risk triple-negative breast cancer, the potential incremental efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant administration of atezolizumab/placebo with a sequential regimen of weekly paclitaxel with every-3-week carboplatin followed immediately by neoadjuvant administration of atezolizumab/placebo with AC/EC will be evaluated. Patients will then undergo surgery. Following recovery from surgery, patients will initiate approximately 6 months of adjuvant therapy with atezolizumab/placebo and receive the same investigational agent they received pre-operatively. Administration of radiation therapy will be based on local standards at the discretion of patients and investigators, but if administered, atezolizumab/placebo will be administered concurrently. Adjuvant atezolizumab/placebo may be delayed until after completion of radiation therapy per investigator discretion. Patients with residual invasive cancer at the time of surgery may receive capecitabine concurrently with atezolizumab/placebo in the adjuvant setting per investigator discretion and local guidelines. Patients with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations with residual invasive cancer at the time of surgery may receive olaparib in the adjuvant setting per investigator discretion and local guidelines. Patients receiving olaparib must discontinue atezolizumab/placebo.\n\nThe primary aims of the study are 1) to determine value of atezolizumab in improving pathologic complete response in the breast and post-therapy lymph nodes evaluated histologically (pCR breast and nodes \\[(ypT0/Tis ypN0)\\]), and 2) to determine the value of atezolizumab in improving event-free survival (EFS). Secondary aims include: pathologic complete response in the breast (ypT0/Tis); pathologic complete response in the breast and lymph nodes (ypT0 ypN0); positive nodal status conversion rate; overall survival; recurrence-free interval: distant disease-free survival; brain metastases free survival; and toxicity. The stratification factors for the study are: 1) clinical size of the primary tumor (1.1-3.0 cm; \\> 3.0 cm); 2) nodal status as determined by protocol-specified criteria (negative, positive); 3) AC/EC (every 2 weeks; every 3 weeks); and 4) Region (North America; Europe).\n\nFor patient eligibility, local testing on the diagnostic core must have determined the patient's tumor to be ER-negative, PgR-negative, and HER2-negative by current ASCO/CAP guidelines. Material from either the diagnostic core biopsy or the research biopsy must be sent for central testing for confirmation of ER, PgR, and HER2 to confirm eligibility. If local testing has determined a tumor to be HER2 equivocal or to have a borderline ER/PgR status (% IHC staining \\< 10% for both), material may be submitted for central testing to determine eligibility.\n\nIn order to proactively identify and further assess any cardiac toxicity that may occur with the combination of anthracyclines and atezolizumab, this study includes a cardiac safety lead-in for the first 60 patients who initiate AC/EC. The safety lead-in will consist of assessment of ECG and serum troponin-T obtained just prior to administration of the first dose of AC/EC, following completion of the administration of the 1st and 3rd cycle of AC/EC prior to initiation of the atezolizumab/placebo. An additional assessment of LVEF with echocardiogram or MUGA scan will also be obtained prior to the 3rd dose of AC/EC. In order to provide an early assessment of cardiac safety, results of the troponin-T assessments, ECGs, LVEF assessment, and cardiac safety data will be evaluated by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) when the last of the initial 20 patients who initiate AC/EC undergo their scheduled post-surgery LVEF assessment. When the last of the first 60 patients to initiate AC/EC undergo their scheduled post-surgery LVEF assessment, results of the troponin assessments, ECGs, LVEF assessments, and cardiac safety data from all 60 patients will be evaluated by the DSMB.\n\nResearch core biopsies of breast primary at baseline and 1-4 days prior to the second dose of atezolizumab/placebo are a study requirement for all patients. One to three representative blocks of residual primary tumor containing the maximum amount of tumor and node with the largest focus of metastasis is required from the definitive breast surgery if gross residual disease is greater than or equal to 1.0 cm. If gross residual disease is less than 1.0 cm, tissue should be submitted, if possible. Blood specimens will be collected on all patients at baseline for exploratory biomarker analysis and to support future correlative studies.\n\nAccrual to NSABP B-59/GBG 96-GeparDouze began in December 2017 and was completed in May 2021 with a total of 1550 patients randomized. Based on actual accrual and the decision to eliminate pCR as a co-primary endpoint, we recalculated the power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.70 attributed to the addition of atezolizumab, assuming a lost-to-follow-up rate of 0.00083 per month, using the actual accrual pattern for the power calculation. With 1550 patients accrued in 42 months, an additional 22 months follow up will allow us to obtain 252 events under the assumptions stated above, which will provide 80% power to detect a HR of 0.7 between the atezolizumab and the placebo arm at an overall 2-sided alpha level of 0.05.",

    "brief_summary": "Up to 50% of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients will develop metastases in the course of their disease. Cytotoxic therapy is a standard treatment in this setting but yields average tumor response rates of 25% at first line and \u226410% at later lines. It is also limited in the number of lines and courses by tolerance issues. Trials include poly/oligometastases indistinctively and suggest that consolidation ablation is used in \\~20% of patients with residual oligometastases refractory to chemotherapy. Oligometastases represent a stage of disease between completely absent and widely metastatic, and which might be cured if the limited numbers of metastatic sites are eradicated. Ablative strategies to treat patients with oligometastases from sarcomas yield prolonged survival times and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is associated with excellent tolerance. Surgery may be offered in selected metastatic cases. Alternatively and increasingly, SBRT yields high control rates at treated sites (\u2265 80%). The so-called radioresistance of sarcomas is overcome by the high doses per fraction made possible owing to the high precision achieved with SBRT. SBRT is an accepted treatment strategy provided that tumor burden remains limited in the number and size of metastases. Systemic treatment can be combined with SBRT. SBRT may produce abscopal effects where tumors outside the irradiation area also demonstrate tumor shrinkage in some occurrences. SBRT produces systemic antitumoral immune response in certain conditions and enhances radiation-induced tumor cell death compared to conventional lower dose irradiation. Abscopal effects have been potentialized with SBRT/immunotherapy in several tumor models. Sarcomas are a privileged target tumor given their high metastatic propensity.\n\nSeveral potent immunomodulators that skew the tumor immune microenvironment toward a proimmunity context are being investigated in STS either alone or in combination with chemotherapy or targeted therapy. The PD-1 receptor is present within the tumor microenvironment, and limits the activity of infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes, thus blocking effective immune responses. The action of PD-1 is triggered upon binding to its ligands. PD-1 can stimulate the immunosuppressive function of regulatory T cells. Moreover, blockade of PD-1 can stimulate anti-tumor immune responses. Significant responses have been obtained in several sarcomas with acceptable tolerance. Preliminary clinical experience suggests that immunotherapy can be efficient in refractory leiomyosarcomas. Several drugs targeting the PD-1/PD-L1/2 axis are ongoing either as single agents or in combination with ipilimumab, kinase inhibitors, or chemotherapy in STS subtypes. Combination of radiotherapy with immunotherapy is included as a means of increasing tumor antigen release in metastatic STS. Immunomodulated SBRT is a particularly attractive strategy, given the potential of radiation to induce cytotoxicity in tumors and induce abscopal effects. A phase II radiation trial showed increased apoptosis-, intra-tumoral dendritic cells and accumulation of intratumoral T cells in STS with correlation with tumor-specific immune responses.\n\nWe here propose a randomized phase II study to prolong progression-free survival (PFS) with the combination of SBRT/immunotherapy in oligometastatic STS patients.\n\nSBRT is well-tolerated with hardly any severe toxicity (fewer than 5% acute and late grade 3 toxicities). It is performed in an ambulatory setting in only a few treatment fractions. Associations between irradiation and immunomodulatory agents appear to be synergistic and show favorable tolerance profiles. Immunomodulatory agents have a more favorable toxicity profile than cytotoxic agents with about 65% overall acute toxicities. Immunotherapy selectively binds to PD-L1 and competitively blocks its interaction with PD-1.\n\nCompared with anti-PD-1 antibodies that target T-cells, immunotherapy targets tumor cells, and is therefore may induce fewer side effects, including a lower risk of autoimmune-related safety issues, as blockade of PD-L1 leaves the PD-L2 - PD-1 pathway intact to promote peripheral self-tolerance.\n\nStereotactic irradiation is associated with an excellent tolerance with rates of grade 3 or more toxicities below 5%.\n\nPreliminary data of toxicity with the association of stereotactic irradiation and immunotherapy show no cumulative toxicity in association with immunotherapy. However, their incidence and characteristics are no different from that observed with stereotactic irradiation alone. Moreover, intracranial metastases are exceptional in sarcomas.\n\nThe toxicity of the association for extracranial stereotactic irradiation does not seem to be increased either.",

    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, biomarker, cognitive and clinical efficacy of investigational products in participants with an Alzheimer's disease-causing mutation by determining if treatment with the study drug slows the rate of progression of cognitive/clinical impairment or improves disease-related biomarkers.",
    "detailed_description": "This study will recruit participants from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) observational study, a multicenter international study supported by the National Institutes of Health (Grant Number U01-AG032438; RJ Bateman), Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trial Units (DIAN-TU) sites, DIAN-TU partner sites, DIAN Expanded Registry (DIAN-EXR), and families identified by the sites. As part of the DIAN-TU-001 protocol, participants undergo longitudinal assessments that include clinical assessment, cognitive testing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and analysis of blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n\nParticipants in DIAN are recruited from families that have at least one member who has been identified as having a mutation linked to dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD). The mutations in presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) that are associated with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease have very high penetrance (near 100%). This study enrolls individuals who are either known to have a disease-causing mutation or who are at risk for such a mutation (the descendant or sibling of a proband with a known mutation) and unaware of their genetic status. Because the age at onset of cognitive changes is relatively consistent within each family and with each mutation, an age at onset is determined for each affected parent or mutation as part of the DIAN Observational (DIAN-OBS) study protocol. This study will enroll participants who are either asymptomatic and are within a specific window of time of expected age at onset for their family and/or mutation or who have symptoms of mild Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe ability to identify individuals destined to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) and predict the age of onset with a high degree of confidence provides a unique opportunity to assess the efficacy of therapies at asymptomatic and very early stages of dementia. Families with known disease-causing mutations are extremely rare and are geographically dispersed throughout the world. These constraints necessitate a specialized study design. Many of the participants in this study will not yet have any cognitive symptoms of AD; they will be \"asymptomatic\" carriers of mutations that cause dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease and would be expected to perform normally on standard cognitive and functional testing. Imaging and fluid biomarkers will be used to demonstrate that the treatment compounds have engaged their therapeutic targets. A set of cognitive measures designed to assess the very earliest and most subtle cognitive changes will be collected. Additionally, because many at-risk individuals decide not to know whether they have the disease-associated mutation or not, when allowable in individual drug arms, some of the at-risk individuals enrolled in this study will not have the disease-causing mutations; they will be \"mutation negative\". It is important to enroll these participants to avoid coercion (e.g., potential participants may be pressured into genetic testing to learn their genetic status in order to be eligible for the trial) unless the drug-specific design includes open-label treatment. These mutation negative individuals will be assigned to the placebo group and data will be used to determine normal ranges of outcome measures. Participants and site study staff will remain blinded as to these individuals' active or placebo group assignment and mutation status. Thus, the study will be double-blinded for placebo and for mutation status, except for mutation positive participants who are aware of their genetic status. There may be exceptional circumstances when required by local regulation or health authorities where enrollment may be restricted to mutation carriers only, but such mandates will be thoroughly documented and agreed upon by the governing regulatory agency and sponsor.\n\nThis is an adaptive platform-based study. Several different therapies (each referred to as a study drug arm) will be tested in order to increase the likelihood that an effective treatment will be discovered. The compounds are selected for this trial based on mechanism of action and available data on efficacy and safety profile. The study design includes a pooled placebo group (referred to as the mutation positive placebos) which may be shared by study drug arms. Mutation positive participants will be assigned to a study drug arm and subsequently randomized within that arm to the active drug to placebo ratio specified in each drug-specific appendix. When included in individual drug arms, mutation negative participants will all receive placebo treatment. Participants and study staff will not be blinded as to which study drug arm each participant has been assigned; they will be blinded as to whether participants have been randomized to active drug or placebo.\n\nBiomarker, cognitive, and/or clinical endpoints will be specified for each study drug arm. Biomarker data will be analyzed for pre-specified endpoints consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and other AD biomarker outcomes.\n\nInterim analyses of the imaging or fluid biomarker endpoint will assess safety and whether each study drug engages its biological targets. The clinical and cognitive assessments are designed to assess subtle cognitive changes that may be detectable before the onset of dementia as well as cognitive and clinical decline in symptomatic groups.\n\nAfter the last participant in a study drug arm completes the 4-year treatment period, participants in that study drug arm may be eligible to receive active study drug in an open-label extension period.\n\nA cognitive run-in (CRI) period was implemented to allow for enrollment during periods when study drug arms are not randomizing. This enables the DIAN-TU platform to have continuous enrollment during periods before or in-between drug arm randomization.\n\nThe CRI period of cognitive, clinical, and imaging data collection was designed as part of the platform study to utilize the time in between enrollment of study drug arms. The CRI period will enhance study enrollment by identifying eligible participants and engaging them with the cognitive assessments and can reduce practice effects by allowing participants to habituate to the testing process. The CRI further provides important baseline and run-in data that adds control data to the platform and informs about the effects of tested drugs. The data collected in the CRI period will be used for analysis in the respective drug arm under which participants are randomized and treated.\n\nSolanezumab and gantenerumab double blind treatment arms: Primary Completion Date= Nov 2019 and Study Completion= March 2020 (NCT04623242)\n\nGantenerumab open-label extension was discontinued based on findings from an interim efficacy analysis and the status of the drug program.

    "detailed_description": "Rationale: cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC (CRS-HIPEC) is a curative intent treatment for patients with isolated resectable colorectal peritoneal metastases (PM). Upfront CRS-HIPEC alone is the standard treatment in the Netherlands. The addition of neoadjuvant and adjuvant systemic therapy (together: perioperative systemic therapy) to CRS-HIPEC could have benefits and drawbacks. Potential benefits are eradication of systemic micrometastases, preoperative intraperitoneal tumour downstaging, elimination of post-surgical residual cancer cells, and improved patient selection for CRS-HIPEC. Potential drawbacks are preoperative disease progression and secondary unresectability for CRS-HIPEC, systemic therapy related toxicity, increased postoperative morbidity, decreased quality of life, and higher costs. Currently, there is a complete lack of randomised studies that prospectively compare the oncological efficacy of perioperative systemic therapy and CRS-HIPEC with upfront CRS-HIPEC alone. Notwithstanding this lack of evidence, perioperative systemic therapy is widely administered to patients with isolated resectable colorectal PM. However, administration and timing of perioperative systemic therapy vary substantially between countries, hospitals, and guidelines. More importantly, it remains unknown whether perioperative systemic therapy has an intention-to-treat benefit in this setting. Therefore, this study randomises patients with isolated resectable colorectal PM to receive either perioperative systemic therapy (experimental arm) or upfront CRS-HIPEC alone (control arm).\n\nStudy design: a multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, phase II-III, superiority study that randomises eligible patients in a 1:1 ratio.\n\nObjectives: objectives of the phase II study (80 patients) are to explore the feasibility of accrual, the feasibility, safety, and tolerance of perioperative systemic therapy, and the radiological and pathological response of colorectal PM to neoadjuvant systemic therapy. The primary objective of the phase III study (358 patients) is to compare overall survival between both arms. Secondary objectives are to assess progression-free and disease-free survival, surgical characteristics, major postoperative morbidity, patient-reported outcomes, and costs in both arms. Other objectives are to assess major systemic therapy related toxicity and the objective radiological and pathological response of colorectal PM to neoadjuvant systemic therapy.\n\nStudy population: adults who have a good performance status, histological or cytological proof of PM of a colorectal adenocarcinoma, resectable disease, no systemic colorectal metastases within three months prior to enrolment, no systemic therapy for colorectal cancer within six months prior to enrolment, no previous CRS-HIPEC, no contraindications for the planned systemic treatment or CRS-HIPEC, and no relevant concurrent malignancies.\n\nIntervention: at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist, perioperative systemic therapy consists of either four 3-weekly neoadjuvant and adjuvant cycles of capecitabine with oxaliplatin (CAPOX), six 2-weekly neoadjuvant and adjuvant cycles of 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), or six 2-weekly neoadjuvant cycles of 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin with irinotecan (FOLFIRI) followed by either four 3-weekly (capecitabine) or six 2-weekly (5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) adjuvant cycles of fluoropyrimidine monotherapy. Bevacizumab is added to the first three (CAPOX) or four (FOLFOX/FOLFIRI) neoadjuvant cycles.\n\nEndpoints: primary endpoints of the phase II study are to explore the feasibility and safety of perioperative systemic therapy by comparing proportions of patients undergoing complete CRS-HIPEC and proportions of patients with major postoperative morbidity between both arms. The primary comparative endpoint of the phase III study is overall survival. Major secondary endpoints assessed in both arms are proportions of major postoperative morbidity, progression-free survival, disease-free survival, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and costs. Major secondary endpoints assessed in the experimental arm are the proportion of patients with major systemic therapy related toxicity and the proportions of patients with objective radiological and pathological responses of colorectal PM to neoadjuvant systemic therapy.\n\nStatistical analysis: the study is powered to detect an increase in 3-year overall survival from 50% in the control arm to 65% in the experimental arm (corresponding hazard ratio 0.62), which is considered to be a clinically relevant difference by the investigators. A total number of 358 patients (179 in each arm) is needed to detect this hypothesized difference with 5% drop-out, 80% power, and a two-sided log-rank test of p\\<0.05. In August 2024, when several patients in the experimental arm were still receiving trial treatment, a regular follow-up update revealed that 156 events for the primary outcome (i.e. deaths) had occurred. The study then had 85% power to detect the hypothesized hazard ratio of 0.62 for overall survival in the analysis of superiority of the experimental arm relative to the control arm at a two-sided alpha of 0.05. After discussing these data with the Data Monitoring Committee and the medical ethics committee, it was decided to schedule data cut-off for a first analysis of the primary outcome at the time the last patient in the experimental arm (enrolled April 2024) finishes trial treatment, which is expected 1 November 2024 at an estimated number of +/- 172 events (+/- 88% power).",

    "detailed_description": "In December 2019, a group of patients with the acute respiratory disease was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China. A month later, a new beta-coronavirus was identified as the cause of the 2019 coronavirus infection. Despite China's efforts to contain the disease, it spread rapidly outside the continent. Currently, Mexico is one of the countries that is facing this world health problem with a dynamic and exponential increase in the number of confirmed cases.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that belongs to the group of \u03b2-coronaviruses of the subgenus Coronaviridae. The SARS-CoV-2 is the third known zoonotic coronavirus disease after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS). The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 recommended by the WHO, CDC is the collection of a sample from the upper respiratory tract (nasal and oropharyngeal exudate) or from the lower respiratory tract such as expectoration of endotracheal aspirate and bronchioloalveolar lavage and its analysis using the test of real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).\n\nThe clinical manifestations of the patients are heterogeneous presenting asymptomatic symptoms, mild respiratory disease, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory failure syndrome (ARDS), and even death. According to the Berlin definition, ARDS is an acute lung injury that occurs within 7 days after the triggering event and is characterized by bilateral lung infiltrates and severe progressive hypoxemia, as well as non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The mortality associated with ARDS depends on its severity: mild 27%, moderate 32%, and severe 45%. In patients with SARS and SARS-CoV-2, the average duration of mechanical ventilation was reported in 10 (7-12) days, achieving extubation in 6/18 (33%) of which their meantime under mechanical ventilation was 11 (7-12) days. Of these patients, none received treatment with tocilizumab, only 1 patient received hydroxychloroquine, and another patient was treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. Therefore, the present study proposes that the use of Tocilizamab will shorten the time to improve, so an evaluation of the ARDS will be carried out at 7 days.\n\nInitial reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a severe illness that requires the intensive care unit in approximately 5% of confirmed infections. In the CDC report from China, the clinical manifestations of the disease were divided into:\n\nMild: Mild respiratory symptoms (cough, malaise, temperature\\> 37.5, runny nose) with or without pneumonia data by an imaging study (up to 81% cases) Severe: dyspnea, increase in respiratory rate \u2265 30 breaths / min, oxygen saturation \u2264 93%, PaO2 / FiO2 \\<300 mmHg, and image lung infiltrates\\> 50% within 24 to 48 hours of symptom onset (up to 14 % of the cases) Critical: respiratory failure, septic shock and/or multiple organ failure (up to 5% of cases)\n\nChina's mortality rate from SARS-CoV-2 was 2.84%, with a ratio of male to female deaths of 3.25: 1. The average age of death was 75 years, and the average time from the first symptom to death was 14 days. For people age 70 and older, the average time from first symptoms to death was shorter than for people younger than age 70. In another retrospective study of 99 cases, 17% of patients developed Acute Respiratory Failure Syndrome (ARDS), and 11% worsened in a few days and died. Critical case mortality has been documented to reach 60.5%, however, Mexico still does not exist epidemiological data because is not yet reached the zenith of the pandemic.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 infection causes dysregulation of the immune response mediated by cytokines and chemokines. An increase in inflammation-related cytokines including IL-2, IL-7, and IL-10, colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), protein 10 inducible interferon g (IP10), protein, was reported in plasma samples from patients. monocyte chemoattractant (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1A), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), especially in severe patients. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 patients have a large infiltrate of inflammatory immune cells and severe lung inflammation. IL-6 and IL-10 expression levels increase the risk of progression to a critical condition.\n\nCytokine storm syndrome is a phenomenon during which there is an immune dysregulation due to the increase of proinflammatory cytokines in response to stimulation by microorganisms or drugs.\n\nUnder homeostasis conditions, the body's pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrations remain relatively balanced. Before infection, there may be abnormal and dysregulated activation of dendritic cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, and NK cells. The release and action of a large number of proinflammatory cytokines facilitate a positive feedback loop. After a certain threshold, there may be a cytokine storm. Patients will present with fever, diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC), shock, and organ failure. The transition from mild to severe disease in COVID-19 patients may be caused by a cytokine storm.\n\nManifestations of a dysregulated inflammatory response have been identified in patients with COVID-19. The cardinal features of this syndrome include constant fever, cytopenias, and hyperferritinemia. Pulmonary involvement, including ARDS, occurs in approximately 50% of patients. A cytokine profile that resembles LHHS has been associated with COVID-19 disease severity.\n\nAt the time of infection, immune mechanisms are activated, including specific and non-specific immune responses. Endogenous viral protein synthesized within infected cells can activate virus-specific CD8 + T cells through the major pathway of the histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I). There is then proliferation, differentiation, and effector responses of CD8 + T cells (24). Increased IL-2, IL-7, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interferon-\u03b3 inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-\u03b1, and necrosis factor have been observed in severe cases tumor-\u03b1. Continuous and dysregulated amplification exacerbates the manifestations associated with infection, while hypoxia and necrosis eventually lead to an uncontrolled inflammatory response and will trigger cytokine storms. There is a probability that immunosuppression is beneficial in a hyper-inflammatory state.\n\nTherapeutic options include steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, selective cytokine blockade (eg, Anakinra or Tocilizumab), JAK inhibition, vaccines, reinfusion of serum from recovered patients, progenitor therapy, elimination of immune cells (eg. , Alendizumab, Rituximab), among others.\n\nAll patients with severe COVID - 19 should undergo tests for hyper inflammation using laboratory tests such as ferritin levels, platelet count, globulin sedimentation rate, and H score measurement in order to determine the subgroup of patients to whom the immunosuppression may improve the risk of mortality.\n\nA study carried out to identify the immune characteristics of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed that patients in the intensive care unit had a significant decrease in hemoglobin and albumin, with an increase in concentrations of the c-reactive protein (PCR), alanine aminotransfer (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (DHL). The total number of leukocytes did not show significant differences, while the number of lymphocytes decreased significantly. Furthermore, they found an increase in the number of G-CSF and in IL-6, suggesting a high risk of monocyte-mediated release of inflammatory cytokines that can migrate to the lung and produce severe clinical manifestations and even death.\n\nThe management of the critically ill adult patient with SARS-CoV-2 is not standardizing, however, the panel of experts from the \"Surviving Sepsis Campaign\" has published 54 recommendations for the management of the patient with severe SARS-CoV-2 and ARDS. The recommendations focus on hemodynamic support, fluid therapy, use of vasoactive agents, invasive mechanical ventilation, as well as management of the \"cytokine storm\" syndrome.\n\nOne of the proposals for the treatment of cytokine storm and macrophage activation in severe or critical stages of SARS-CoV-2 is the use of drugs that inhibit the interaction of IL-6 with its receptor. Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 immunoglobulin subclass, is directed against soluble or membrane IL-6 receptors (IL-6R). TCZ inhibits the binding of IL-6 to its receptor by reducing pro-inflammatory activity.\n\nThe use of TCZ in patients with severe/critical SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in China. Patients received TCZ treatment at an initial dose of 400 mg with an additional dose in the patient with persistent fever (maximum of two doses). The patients presented a rapid reduction in fever and in the supplemental oxygen requirement in the days after receiving the medication. Despite the promising results of this study, there is currently no solid evidence demonstrating the safety and efficacy of TCZ for the clinical treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The FDA recently approved a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TCZ (ActemraMR) added to standard care in hospitalized adult patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, which will be held in the United States of America (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04320615). Likewise, Italy is recruiting patients for a phase II study with a single TCZ treatment arm in critically ill patients (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04317092, NCT04315480). China is conducting a study with Tocilizumab vs. renal replacement therapy for the management of cytokine release syndrome (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04306705). In patients with mild-moderate SARS-CoV-2, the US will initiate a phase 2 study in 50 patients to assess its efficacy (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04331795). As well as its comparison with other medications (hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04332094) and combinations (Favipiravir + Tocilizumab vs Favipiravir and Tocilizumab ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04310228).",
