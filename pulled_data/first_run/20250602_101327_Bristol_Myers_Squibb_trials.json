    "detailed_description": "This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational kidney cancer vaccine and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational kidney cancer vaccine to use for further studies. \"Investigational\" means that the kidney cancer vaccine, in this case the Personalized Neoantigen Cancer Vaccine, is being studied. It also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the Personalized Cancer Vaccine for any use in patients, including people with kidney cancer.\n\nPoly-ICLC (also called Hiltonol) is an experimental \"viral mimic\" and an activator of immunity. Poly-ICLC is an investigational drug, meaning the FDA has not approved it as a treatment for any disease.\n\nPersonalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine: The purpose of this study is to determine if it is possible to make and administer safely a vaccine against kidney cancer by using information gained from specific characteristics of the participant's own kidney cancer. It is known that kidney cancers have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an individual patient and tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the participant's body fight any tumor cells that could cause the kidney cancer to come back in the future. The study will examine the safety of the vaccine when given at several different time points and will examine the participant's blood cells for signs that the vaccine induced an immune response.\n\nIpilimumab (Yervoy\u2122) is an antibody that has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of melanoma.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are looking at the safety and tolerability of the Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine combined with Ipilimumab as well as the body's immune response to the vaccine. Ipilimumab will be delivered as an injection given underneath the skin rather than injected in the vein in proximity to each vaccination site in order to 1) direct anti-CTLA4 activity to the vaccine-draining lymph nodes and 2) limit potential toxic effects.",

    "detailed_description": "Immunotherapy is an innovative approach being developed for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, a lethal and relatively chemotherapy-resistant disease. However, the tumor and its environment have developed a number of ways in which they inhibit the function of the immune system preventing it from recognizing and killing the cancer. In addition, the investigators still do not understand how T cells, the cells in the immune system that have the potential to recognize cancer as different and kill cancer cells, traffic into the tumor to accomplish their task. The investigators are currently testing an immune system activating pancreatic cancer vaccine (known as GVAX) in combination with immune boosting doses of the chemotherapy agent, cyclophosphamide, as preoperative and postoperative treatments for pancreatic cancer. The investigators have discovered tertiary lymphoid aggregates, a unique lymph node-like structure formed within resected tumors from the patients who received the vaccine two weeks prior to the surgery. This discovery demonstrates that the immune system can get into the tumor and provides the investigators with the opportunity to better understand how these immune cells traffic into the tumor and function once they arrive. The investigators also found that the vaccine causes an increase in signals that would suppress the immune system's ability to fight off cancer cells, including signals involving PD-1. In this novel study, the investigators will test the effects of blocking PD-1 in combination with the vaccine in patients with pancreatic cancer. The investigators will specifically isolate these immune cells and evaluate at both the genetic and protein level, the types of signals expressed by these aggregates. The investigators will compare aggregates from patients with long term survival versus patients who succumb to their cancer early. In this way, the investigators will be able to determine how safe this novel treatment is, how effective it is at changing the immune system in pancreatic cancer, and how it impacts the health and survival of pancreatic cancer patients who undergo surgery to remove the cancer.",

Although these results are encouraging, the response rates seen are moderate compared to what has been documented for the combination of checkpoint inhibitors in other cancer indications. An approach to further enhance the PFS and response rate in MPM may be to use a vaccine aiming to activate an immune response directed against tumor-related antigens, and to combine the vaccine with checkpoint inhibitors.

We hypothesize that direct targeting of the pancreatic cancer cells by chemotherapy and hypofractionated radiotherapy is necessary for initial anti-tumor response. Furthermore, the combination of immunotherapy as a maintenance strategy will have profound anti-tumor efficacy in this setting.\n\nImplications of hypothesis:\n\n* Improved response rate above historical controls\n* Lengthened progression-free survival\n* Improved overall-survival\n\nExploratory Hypothesis:\n\nWe hypothesize that baseline markers of immune activation such as Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes and CD8+ lymphocytes will correlate with response to ipililumab + nivolumab and that responders will have distinct tumor immune phenotype as determined by immunohistochemistry and gene expression profiling compared to nonresponders.",
    "detailed_description": "This is a single arm, single institution study, which aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with radiosurgery nivolumab and ipilimumab as a maintenance regimen following first line induction chemotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.\n\nChemotherapy will be administrated for a minimum of 4 cycles. Patients who have not progressed on chemotherapy will receive SBRT to one primary/metastatic tumor, followed by ipilimumab (1mg/kg every six weeks) + nivolumab (360mg every three weeks). After a further 8 weeks patients will be assessed for response; responders will continue ipilimumab + nivolumab until disease progression, non-responders will receive very low dose radiation to metastatic sites (this will only be allowed once) prior to continuing ipilimumab + nivolumab until disease progression. Immunotherapy will be continued until disease progression or up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nStudy rationale Overall rational in Brief Although there is evidence for that the immune system plays an active role in pancreatic cancer, until now checkpoint inhibitors have yet to demonstrate efficacy in this population. We hypothesize that combining irradiation along with checkpoint inhibition in a patient population demonstrating stable disease in a first line setting will be a novel approach towards the treatment of pancreatic cancer.\n\nRationale for Combining Nivolumab and Ipilimumab The roles of CTLA-4 and PD-1 in inhibiting antitumor responses are largely distinct. Whereas CTLA-4 is thought to regulate T-cell proliferation early in the immune response, primarily in lymph nodes, PD-1 suppresses T cells at a later stage in the immune response, primarily in peripheral tissues.\n\nPreclinical data indicate that the combination of PD-1 and CTLA-4 receptor blockade may improve antitumor activity.\n\nEncouraging response rates for the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab have been demonstrated in several types of cancer such as melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nDue to toxicity concerns regarding the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab, several different doses and schedules were evaluated in a phase 1 study as first-line therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC (CA209012). This study identified an alternative schedule with an acceptable tolerability profile (28% grade 3-4 toxicity) and encouraging activity (31% overall response rate) - nivolumab 360 mg/kg every 3 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, and has therefore been adopted in this protocol.\n\nRationale for Combining Radiosurgery with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 High-dose radiation (such as used in stereotactic radiation body therapy - SBRT) induces DNA damage and cell death. Radiation alone appears to induce a systemic immune response.\n\nThe biologic rationale behind the strategy is that radiation will cause release of immunogenic tumor-antigens from dying tumor cells, which will be processed by cells of the adaptive immune system, eventually promoting tumor-specific targeting of the tumor by the immune system. Success of this strategy will hopefully induce and augment the rarely seen abscopal effect. One possible explanation is that radiation alone rarely induces a rich immune infiltrate into the dying tumor.\n\nRadiation dose and fractionation schedules for optimal synergy between radiotherapy and immunotherapy are not well defined. Three fractions of 8 Gy has been successfully combined with anti-CTLA-4 therapy in mice, and has emerged as a popular regimen for radiation - immunotherapy trials, and has therefore been adopted in this protocol.\n\nStudy Population Estimated accrual - 10 patients. The patients for the study will be identified from the pancreatic cancer clinics at Sheba Medical Center with advanced pancreatic cancer (stage IV) in the first-line setting.\n\nApproximately 17 patients will be initially evaluated in the first line setting. We estimate that approximately 50-60% will not progress at three months and they will continue to receive the study treatment. Only the non-progressors who receive SBRT and combination immunotherapy will be evaluated in the ITT population.\n\nTREATMENT PLAN:\n\nStereotactic radiosurgery Simulation will be performed in accordance with the target lesion location, with 3D or 4D CT as appropriate. Three fractions of 8 Gy, treated on alternate days (in exceptional circumstances, may treat on consecutive days).\n\nNivolumab and Ipilimumab Nivolumab administered IV over 30 minutes at a dose of 360mg every 3 weeks. Ipilimumab administered IV over 30 minutes at 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks following the administration of nivolumab. On the day of infusion, nivolumab is to be administered first. Ipilimumab will start at least 30 minutes after completion of the nivolumab infusion. Nivolumab and ipilimumab will be continued until the progression of disease, discontinuation due to toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study closure. In any event medication will not be continued beyond 24 months. Subjects may discontinue only ipilimumab and continue treatment with nivolumab if certain circumstances are met. Treatment beyond initial investigator assessed RECIST v1.1 defined progression 2 is permitted if the subject has investigator assessed clinical benefit and is tolerating nivolumab and ipilimumab.\n\nLow dose irradiation at first progression At time of 1st progression, at physician's discretion, a single fraction of low dose irradiation (2Gy) will be given to the metastatic lesions. These patients will continue with immunotherapy - Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in accordance with treatment protocol. Approximately one week prior to irradiation a simulation scan will be required. The extent of the low radiation field will depend on the number and location of the metastases, as well as the feasibility and safety of the treatment.\n\nDuration of Therapy\n\nIn the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue until one of the following criteria applies:\n\n* Second disease progression\n* Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment\n* Unacceptable adverse event(s)\n* Patient decides to withdraw from the study\n* General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator\n* Clinical progression\n* Patient non-compliance\n* Pregnancy\n* Termination of the study by sponsor\n* The drug manufacturer can no longer provide the study agent\n* In any event medication will not be continued beyond 24 months.\n\nDuration of Follow-Up After removal from study treatment patients will return to the clinic for a short-term FU visit 28 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n\nFirst long term FU should be performed 100days after the last dose of study drug, and every 90 days thereafter, until death, termination of the study or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. In addition, patients in survival follow-up will be contacted following the data cut-off for the primary analysis and all subsequent survival analyses to provide complete survival data. These contacts should generally occur within 7 days of the data cut off.\n\n* All patients who start the study treatments should be followed up.\n* information may be obtained via telephone contact, patient's notes, or public records.\n* If the site becomes aware that a patient has died prior to the final analysis, data should be completed at that time.\n* Patients who discontinue treatment prior to progression should continue to have RECIST assessments (every 8 weeks from starting study treatment), until confirmed objective disease progression, as defined by RECIST 1.1.\n\nDose Delay Criteria: Tumor assessments for all subjects should continue as per protocol even if dosing is delayed.\n\nNivolumab and ipilimumab administration should be delayed for the following:\n\n* Any Grade \u2265 2 non-skin, drug-related adverse event, except for fatigue and laboratory abnormalities\n* Any Grade \u2265 3 skin drug-related AE\n* Any Grade \u2265 3 drug-related laboratory abnormality with the following exceptions for lymphopenia, AST, ALT, or total bilirubin or asymptomatic amylase or lipase:\n\n  * Grade 3 lymphopenia does not require a dose delay\n  * If a subject has a baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin that is within normal limits, delay dosing for drug-related Grade \u2265 2 toxicity\n  * If a subject has baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin within the Grade 1 toxicity range, delay dosing for drug-related Grade \u2265 3 toxicity\n  * Any Grade \u2265 3 drug-related amylase or lipase abnormality that is not associated with symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis does not require dose delay. The Principal Investigator should be consulted for such Grade \u2265 3 amylase or lipase abnormalities.\n* Any AE, laboratory abnormality or inter-current illness which, in the judgment of the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication.\n\nSubjects receiving ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab that have drug-related toxicities that meet the criteria for dose delay, should have both drugs (ipilimumab and nivolumab) delayed until retreatment criteria are met. Exceptions apply to the retreatment criteria after dose delay of ipilimumab and nivolumab for Grade \u2265 3 amylase and lipase abnormalities that are not associated with symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis and that are attributed to ipilimumab alone.\n\nRescheduling\n\n* Nivolumab may be delayed until the next planned ipilimumab dose if the next ipilimumab dose is scheduled within the next 12 days. This will permit periodic ipilimumab dosing to be synchronized with nivolumab dosing.\n* Ipilimumab should be dosed at the specified interval regardless of any delays in intervening nivolumab doses. However, in order to maintain periodic synchronized dosing of ipilimumab and nivolumab, the dosing days of nivolumab and ipilimumab may be adjusted within the permitted +/- 5 day window, as long as consecutive nivolumab doses are given at least 12 days apart. Ipilimumab may be delayed beyond the 5 day window if needed to synchronize with the next nivolumab dose.\n* If an ipilimumab dose is delayed beyond 6 weeks from the prior ipilimumab dose, then subsequent ipilimumab doses should rescheduled to maintain the 6 week interval between consecutive ipilimumab doses. Ipilimumab may not be resumed sooner than 6 weeks (+/- 5days) after the prior ipilimumab dose.\n* A dose delay of ipilimumab which results in no ipilimumab dosing for \\> 12 weeks requires ipilimumab discontinuation, with exceptions as noted in study protocol.\n* Dose delay of nivolumab which results in treatment interruption of \\> 6 weeks requires treatment discontinuation, with exceptions as noted\n\nDose reductions There will be no dose reductions for nivolumab or ipilimumab.\n\nCriteria to Resume Dosing\n\nSubjects may resume treatment with nivolumab and/or ipilimumab when the drug-related AE(s) resolve(s) to Grade \u2264 1 or baseline, with the following exceptions:\n\n* Subjects may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigue.\n* Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug-related skin AE may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity.\n* Subjects with baseline Grade 1 AST/ALT or total bilirubin who require dose delays for reasons other than a 2-grade shift in AST/ALT or total bilirubin may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 AST/ALT OR total bilirubin.\n* Subjects with combined Grade 2 AST/ALT and total bilirubin values meeting discontinuation parameters should have treatment permanently discontinued.\n* Drug-related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis must have resolved to baseline before treatment is resumed.\n* For Nivolumab: Subjects with persistent Grade 1 pneumonitis after completion of a steroid taper over at least 1 month may be eligible for retreatment if discussed with and approved by the Principal Investigator.\n* Subjects who received systemic corticosteroids for management of any drug-related toxicity must be off corticosteroids or have tapered down to an equivalent dose of prednisone \u2264 10 mg/day.\n* Drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone replacement may resume treatment after consultation with the Principal Investigator.\n* In general, subjects who meet criteria to resume ipilimumab will also have met criteria to resume nivolumab, so it should be feasible to synchronize dosing of both drugs when resuming ipilimumab. In order to facilitate this, the dosing days of nivolumab and ipilimumab may be adjusted within the permitted +/- 5 day window, as long as consecutive nivolumab doses are given at least 12 days apart.\n* One exception to note is when ipilimumab and nivolumab doses are delayed due to drug related Grade \u2265 3 amylase or lipase abnormalities not associated with symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis. If the investigator assesses the amylase or lipase abnormality to be related to ipilimumab and not related to nivolumab, nivolumab may be resumed when the amylase or lipase abnormality resolves to Grade \\< 3 but ipilimumab may only be resumed when the amylase or lipase abnormality resolves to Grade 1 or baseline. Investigator attribution of this toxicity to the ipilimumab dosing must be clearly noted in the subject's medical chart. The Principal Investigator should be consulted prior to resuming nivolumab in such subjects\n\nNivolumab Treatment Discontinuation Criteria:\n\n* Any Grade 2 drug-related uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision that does not respond to topical therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity within the re-treatment period OR requires systemic treatment.\n* Any Grade \u2265 2 drug-related pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease that does not resolve to dose delay and systemic steroids (also see Pulmonary Adverse Event Management Algorithm).\n* Any Grade 3 drug-related bronchospasm, hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion reaction, regardless of duration.\n* Any Grade 3 non-skin, drug-related adverse event lasting \\> 7 days, with the following exceptions for uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, diarrhea, colitis, neurologic toxicity, hypersensitivity reactions, infusion reactions, endocrinopathies, and laboratory abnormalities:\n\n  * Grade 3 drug-related uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, diarrhea, colitis, neurologic toxicity, hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion reaction of any duration requires discontinuation.\n  * Grade 3 drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone replacement do not require discontinuation.\n  * Grade 3 drug-related laboratory abnormalities do not require treatment discontinuation except:\n  * Grade 3 drug-related thrombocytopenia \\> 7 days or associated with bleeding requires discontinuation.\n  * Any drug-related liver function test (LFT) abnormality that meets the following criteria require discontinuation (also see Hepatic Adverse Event Management Algorithm):\n\n    * AST or ALT \\> 5-10 x ULN for \\> 2 weeks\n    * Total bilirubin \\> 5 x ULN\n    * Concurrent AST or ALT \\> 3 x ULN and total bilirubin \\> 2 x ULN\n* Any Grade 4 drug-related adverse event or laboratory abnormality, except for the following events, which do not require discontinuation:\n\n  * Grade 4 neutropenia \u2264 7 days\n  * Grade 4 lymphopenia or leukopenia\n  * Isolated Grade 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities that are not associated with symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis and decrease to \\< Grade 4 within 1 week of onset. The Principal Investigator should be consulted for Grade 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities\n  * Isolated Grade 4 electrolyte imbalances/abnormalities that are not associated with clinical sequelae and are corrected with supplementation/appropriate management within 72 hours of their onset\n  * Grade 4 drug-related endocrinopathy adverse events such as adrenal insufficiency, ACTH deficiency, hyper- or hypothyroidism, or glucose intolerance, which resolve or are adequately controlled with physiologic hormone replacement (corticosteroids, thyroid hormones) or glucose controlling agents, respectively, may not require discontinuation after discussion with and approval from the Principal Investigator.\n  * Dosing delays lasting \\> 6 weeks that occur for non-drug-related reasons may be allowed if approved by the Principal Investigator. Periodic study visits to assess safety and laboratory studies should also continue every 6 weeks or more frequently if clinically indicated during such dosing delays.\n* Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject with continued ivolumab dosing.\n\nIf discontinuation criteria are met for ipilimumab but not for nivolumab, treatment with nivolumab may continue.\n\nIpilimumab Treatment Discontinuation Criteria:\n\n* Any Grade \u2265 2 drug-related uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision that does not respond to topical therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity within 2 weeks OR requires systemic treatment.\n* Any Grade \u22653 bronchospasm or other hypersensitivity reaction.\n* Any other Grade 3 non-skin, drug-related adverse with the following exceptions for laboratory abnormalities, grade 3 nausea and vomiting, grade 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and symptomatic endocrinopathies which resolved (with or without hormone substitution).\n* Any drug-related liver function test (LFT) abnormality that meets the following criteria require discontinuation:\n\nAST or ALT \\> 8 x ULN Total bilirubin \\> 5 x ULN Concurrent AST or ALT \\> 3 x ULN and total bilirubin \\> 2 x ULN\n\n* Any Grade 4 drug-related adverse event or laboratory abnormality, except for the following events, which do not require discontinuation:\n\n  * Grade 4 neutropenia \u2264 7 days\n  * Grade 4 lymphopenia or leukopenia\n  * Isolated Grade 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities which are not associated with symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis.\n  * Isolated Grade 4 electrolyte abnormalities that are not associated with clinical sequelae and are corrected with appropriate management within 72 hours of their onset\n  * Grade 4 drug-related endocrinopathy adverse events such as adrenal insufficiency, ACTH deficiency, hyper- or hypothyroidism, or glucose intolerance, which resolve or are adequately controlled with physiologic hormone replacement or glucose controlling agents, respectively, may not require discontinuation after discussion with the Principal Investigator.\n* Dosing delays resulting in no ipilimumab dosing for \\> 12 weeks that occur for non-drug-related reasons may be allowed if approved by the Principal Investigator.\n* Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject with continued ipilimumab dosing\n\nTreatment Beyond Disease Progression 2\n\nSubjects will be permitted to continue on nivolumab and ipilimumab for treatment beyond initial RECIST v1.1 defined PD as long as they meet the following criteria:\n\n* Investigator-assessed clinical benefit and no rapid disease progression\n* Subject is tolerating study treatment\n* Stable performance status\n* Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious complications of disease progression (e.g., CNS metastases) A follow-up scan should be performed within 4 weeks \u00b15 days of original PD to determine whether there has been a continued progression of disease. Subsequent scans should be performed every 8 weeks until further progression is determined.\n\nStudy treatment should be discontinued permanently upon further progression.\n\nADVERSE EVENTS: LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AEs will be graded and recorded throughout the trial and during the follow-up period according to NCI CTCAE Version 5.0. Toxicities will be characterized in terms regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action taken with regard to trial treatment.\n\nIdentifying the adverse event:\n\nAny inflammatory event, especially those that may respond to steroids, should be considered a possible adverse event. Most such events cannot be identified on physical examination. It should be appreciated that patients may not report these symptoms, or may present to other specialists, who may give inappropriate treatment, e.g potent anti-diarrheal to control a resistant diarrhea. Furthermore, physicians should be aware that some side effects may appear many weeks after treatment initiation.\n\nEarly diagnosis and treatment intervention for inflammatory events can help prevent the occurrence of complications, such as GI perforation. Toxicities related to GI (diarrhea and colitis) and skin (rash and pruritus) are the most common inflammatory events reported in studies with ipilimumab.\n\nThe combination of both Nivolumab+ipilimumab results in a safety profile with similar types of AEs as either agent alone, but in some cases, with a greater frequency. In general, dose delays and observation are adequate for low-grade AEs. For moderate- and high-grade AEs, immunosuppression with corticosteroids should be utilized. Once the AE has begun to improve, corticosteroids can be tapered over approximately 3 weeks to 6 weeks (depending on the severity of the AE). The management of AEs considered related to any combination treatment is similar to the management of AEs caused by either agent alone and utilizes the same safety management algorithms.\n\nPatients should be assessed for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, neuropathy, and endocrinopathy; and clinical chemistries (including liver function and thyroid function tests) should be evaluated at baseline and at regular intervals.\n\nOverview of management of adverse event Aside from very mild side effects, the first step should be to hold all study immunotherapies. Early intervention with steroids is to be considered in the majority of cases, followed possibly by re-starting the study therapeutic agents.\n\nDuring evaluation of a suspected immune-mediated AE, all efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxic, or other etiologic causes. Serological, immunological, imaging, and occasionally biopsy with histology (e.g., biopsy-proven lymphocytic) data may be used to support the diagnosis of an immune-mediated toxicity or support an alternative cause of the AE.\n\nIn general, for severe immune-mediated AEs, nivolumab and/or ipilimumab should be permanently discontinued, and systematic high-dose corticosteroid therapy should be initiated. For moderate immune-mediated AEs, ipilimumab should be held or delayed, and moderate-dose corticosteroids should be considered. Upon improvement, corticosteroids should be tapered gradually over at least 1 month.\n\nThe causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all adverse events (AE).\n\nDefinition of Serious Adverse Event Serious events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization.) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important medical event.\n\nSuspected transmission of an infectious agent via the study drug is an SAE. Although pregnancy, overdose, cancer, and potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not always serious by regulatory definition, these events must be handled as SAEs. Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to study therapy should be reported as SAE.\n\nNOTE: The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs:\n\n* a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department \\< 24 hours\n* elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent\n* routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (eg, routine colonoscopy).\n* Medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into the study.\n* Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention.\n* Admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs (applies to oncology protocols)\n\nSerious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period and within 100 days of the last dose of study drug. Subjects, who are randomized and never treated with study drug, must have SAEs collected for 30 days from the date of randomization. If applicable, SAEs that relate to any later protocol-specified procedure (eg, a follow-up skin biopsy) must be collected.\n\nThe investigator should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure.\n\nAn SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness.\n\nIf the investigator believes that an SAE is potentially related to the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication of a study procedure), the relationship should be specified.\n\nSAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS (or designee) within 24 hours of awareness of event. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form; pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form. Paper forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax). In addition, the local IRB will be informed per local regulations.\n\nIf only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. (Note: Follow-up SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.) If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information becomes available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure.\n\nAll SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization. The Investigator will request from BMS the SAE reconciliation report and include the BMS protocol number every 3 months and prior to data base lock or final data summary.\n\nNonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting The collection of non-serious AE information should begin following the subject's written consent to participate in the study And should be followed to resolution or stabilization of the adverse event to grade 1, or reported as SAEs if they become serious. Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment as appropriate. All AEs must be recorded on the CRF.\n\nAll nonserious adverse events are to be collected continuously during the treatment period and for a minimum of 28 days following the last dose of study treatment.\n\nPregnancy Investigator must immediately notify BMS of Pregnancy event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures.\n\nIn the rare event that the benefit of continuing study drug is thought to outweigh the risk, the pregnant subject may continue study drug after a thorough discussion, if allowed by local regulations.\n\nProtocol-required procedures for study discontinuation and follow-up must be performed on the subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (eg, x-ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated.\n\nFollow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.\n\nMen receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with women of childbearing potential will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of nivolumab.\n\nIn order to collect any pregnancy surveillance information from the female partner, the female partner must sign an informed consent form for disclosure of this information. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form and reported to BMS.\n\nOverdose An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product that is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose must be reported as SAEs.\n\nPotential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs .\n\nPotential DILI is defined as: ALT or AST elevation \\> 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) AND Total bilirubin \\> 2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline phosphatase), AND No other immediately causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia.\n\nA hepatic AE management algorithm has been established (and is indicated in the protocol).\n\nCORRELATIVE STUDIES During IO therapy Blood, Stool and Saliva samples for correlative study will be taken cycle 1 Day 1 of and every 8 weeks thereafter. Biopsies of the disease lesion will be obtained prior to start of treatment and at 8 weeks. Specific permission will therefore be included in the consent form. Local regulations for tissue banking and storage will be followed.\n\nFresh biopsy specimens from disease lesion during screening (preferably, at site of SBRT) and at 8 weeks imaging assessment are mandatory. Optional tissue biopsy will be requested at progression. (For patients that have stopped treatment for other reasons than PD, tissue biopsy will be requested at the time of PD.\n\nIn addition, Tissue samples will be submitted from existing archived biopsy (diagnostic specimen), if available.\n\nSTATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nStudy populations will include safety and efficacy:\n\n* Safety Population will include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of ipilimumab, nivolumab.\n* Efficacy population will include all subjects in the Safety Population with at least 1 recorded post-baseline disease assessment Statistical methods will be primarily descriptive in nature. Categorical variables will be summarized using numbers and percentages. Continuous variables will be summarized by total number (n), mean, standard deviation, median, and range (minimum and maximum).\n\nEvent rates will be summarized, and Kaplan-Meier estimates for PFS and OS may also be provided where sample size is adequate.\n\nSafety data, including vital signs, laboratory test results, physical examinations, and adverse events (AEs), will be summarized by dose and assessment time points, as appropriate. Change from baseline will be included in summary tables for laboratory, and vital sign parameters.",

    "detailed_description": "In this study, the aim is to release the brake on the immune response by use of nivolumab, an inhibitory antibody against Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). Nivolumab has shown efficacy and mild toxicity when given as monotherapy for HNSCC at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks, which is the target dose in the present trial.\n\nRadiotherapy is a powerful inducer of inflammation, and the expression of Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is known to be enhanced by inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-gamma (IFNg). Experimental evidence from mice models have shown that radiotherapy induces increased PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue. Moreover, there is evidence suggesting that HNSCC with T-cell infiltration is more sensitive to radiotherapy. There is thus a strong rationale for combing PD-1 inhibitors with radiotherapy. However, this potential remains largely unexplored in humans. The investigators consider that head-and-neck cancer is a particularly attractive entity for investigating this therapeutic combination, because of i) the high radiosensitivity of this cancer form ii) the clinical efficacy of Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors as monotherapy in early clinical trials iii) the availability of tumor biopsies for translational/biomarker research.The RT given in the present study gives considerable side effects, related to inflammation that may be enhanced by Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade.",

One method by which tumor cells may evade immune surveillance is by activation of the programmed cell death (PD-1) pathway, mediated by expression of PD-1 on the surface of T lymphocytes, which conveys an inhibitory signal after binding to its ligand PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells. Nivolumab and Ipilimumab have shown activity as monotherapies in solid tumors and very early data suggest that nivolumab may be particularly active for ovarian clear cell carcinoma.(Hamanishi et al., 2015).

    "detailed_description": "Many serious non-malignant hematologic diseases (NMHD) affecting children, including severe aplastic anemia (SAA), Fanconi anemia (FA), sickle cell disease (SCD), and thalassemia can be cured by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). While the best results are achieved with HSCT from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched siblings, most children lack such donors, and many children with NMHD are therefore transplanted with grafts from an adult unrelated donor (URD). Because URD grafts are less histocompatible, they are more likely to cause GVHD, a process driven by the reaction of donor T cells against incompatible host tissues. Despite the routine administration of immune suppression for GVHD prophylaxis, GVHD claims the lives of many and plagues others with incapacitating chronic illness. For NMHD, the threat of GVHD limits the use of URD HSCT to only the most severely affected children. In African-Americans and other ethnic minorities, the situation is compounded by the fact that most of these children lack fully matched URD and typically receive mismatched and matched grafts, which carry an increased risk for graft rejection. A more effective form of GVHD prophylaxis that does not compromise engraftment is urgently needed, both to improve outcomes for those children undergoing HSCT as well as to allow expansion of this curative therapy to the many children with NMHD who forego transplantation because of the risk for GVHD.\n\nThe researchers have investigated the use of the co-stimulation blocking agent CTLA4-Ig (abatacept) to prevent GVHD. Study results to date indicate that abatacept strongly inhibits allo-reactive donor T cells and is clinically safe and effective. The clinical experience has included a variety of recipients: children and adults, peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) and bone marrow (BM) grafts, as well as mismatched and matched unrelated and matched related donors; all have involved the administration of four IV doses of abatacept, on days -1, +5, +14, and +28, in combination with standard calcineurin inhibitor-based GVHD prophylaxis. Collectively, the results to date suggest that this combination, including abatacept, very effectively prevents acute GVHD. However, these results also suggest that protection against chronic GVHD is more limited. In this current trial, the researchers will attempt to more effectively prevent chronic GVHD by extending the administration of abatacept, giving eight doses (additional doses days +56, +84, +112, and +150). This trial will test the hypothesis that extended abatacept administration (combined with a standard regimen of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil) will effectively prevent acute and chronic GVHD in children and adolescents receiving URD HSCT, without compromising their engraftment or reconstitution of protective immunity to infection.\n\nThe ASCENT Trial is a single arm, multi-center, phase II study testing the hypothesis that extended abatacept administration (combined with a standard regimen of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil) will effectively prevent acute and chronic GVHD in children and adolescents receiving URD HSCT, without compromising their engraftment or reconstitution of protective immunity to infection. The study will enroll 30 pediatric patients with serious NMHD undergoing URD HSCT. The trial will include two strata, based on donor matching. Stratum 1 will be for patients with 7/8 donors and stratum 2 will be for those with 8/8 (matched) donors. Study participants will be admitted to the hospital ten or eleven days prior to the day of transplant (day -10 or day -11) to complete a conditioning regimen to prevent the donor cells from being rejected. Patients will receive one of three reduced toxicity or intensity conditioning regimens based upon underlying disease and/or physician preference: (1) anti-thymocyte globulin, fludarabine, and a low dose of cyclophosphamide (FA patients only); (2) anti-thymocyte globulin, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and a low dose of total body radiation (SAA and other bone marrow failure disorders); or (3) alemtuzumab, fludarabine, melphalan, and thiotepa (hemoglobinopathy and non-SAA bone marrow failure disorders). All participants will receive 8 doses of abatacept (10 mg/kg intravenously on days -1, +5, +14, +28, +56, +84, +112, and +150). Recruitment is expected to last for about 2 years and participants will be followed for up to 3 years. Weight-based peripheral blood samples will be drawn longitudinally through two years to evaluate immune reconstitution.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine the rejection-free, severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free survival in pediatric patients with serious non-malignant hematologic diseases (NMHD) undergoing unrelated donor (URD) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with abatacept added to conventional GVHD prophylaxis. The secondary objective is to characterize the impact of abatacept on infection and the reconstitution of protective immunity to infection.",

    "detailed_description": "1. BACKGROUND The ABC study (NCT02374242) is a phase II clinical trial recruiting 3 cohorts of patients with melanoma brain metastases. 76 patients received immunotherapy with either nivolumab alone or nivolumab combined with ipilimumab. Nivolumab together with ipilimumab was shown to be more effective than nivolumab alone in melanoma brain metastases. The combination will therefore be used in this trial.\n\n   Findings from pre-clinical and clinical research provides evidence supporting the ability of radiotherapy to induce anti-tumour immune responses and augment the efficacy of anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade in melanoma and provide mechanistic rationale for combined therapy.\n2. STUDY DESIGN This current protocol builds on the ABC study and will assess clinical, functional, toxicities and quality of life outcomes with the combined modalities of immunotherapy with radiotherapy to the brain in melanoma patients.\n\n   The main aim of this study will be to assess the effect of immunotherapy +/- concurrent stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS) on the intracranial death rate at 12 months from the commencement of treatment. Secondary aims include the RECIST response in the brain, extracranially and overall, progression free survival, overall survival, neurocognitive function, adverse event rates and quality of life.\n\n   The study will recruit 218 patients with asymptomatic, untreated melanoma brain metastases. All patients will be treated with combination ipilimumab and nivolumab at the doses and duration approved by worldwide regulatory authorities for advanced melanoma. All patients will undergo the the SRS treatment planning MRI of the brain PRIOR to randomisation to ensure that the timing of the baseline intracranial measurements are made within a similar timeframe and so that the delineation of tumour volume is accurately recorded in the same way for both cohorts. Patents will be randomised to receive concurrent intracranial SRS (within 7 days of the baseline / planning MRI scan) or immunotherapy alone. At intracranial disease progression, any form of salvage local therapy (radiotherapy or surgery) may be administered to either cohort.\n\n   Randomisation is 1:1, using a permuted, random block design with stratification by participating centre, LDH (normal / elevated), BRAF (mutant / wild type), 1-2 brain metastases versus \\> 2 brain metastases.\n3. PRIMARY OUTCOME The neurological specific death rate at 12 months - defined as a proximate cause of death which is a sign, symptom, or diagnosis related to metastatic brain disease.\n4. OBJECTIVE RESPONSES A modified version of RECIST will be used to assess response to treatment. The modification allows for up to 5 brain metastastes to be selected as target lesions and a further 5 extracranial lesions. The immune related response criteria (irRC) will also be applied and concordance evaluated with RECIST. The irRC measures the volume of tumour lesions by calculating bi-dimensional measurements of target lesions.\n5. NEUROCOGNITIVE ASSESSMENT, FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE Neurocognitive impairment is a concern in the setting of radiotherapy delivered for brain metastases. The addition of immunotherapy for enhanced local disease control and survival may augment the risks. Quality of life (QoL) assessment is therefore an important objective in clinical trials studying the effects of new interventions, where side effects and tolerability are as important as clinical benefit.\n\n   Neurocognitive function will be assessed at baseline and every 6 to 12 weeks using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and a neurological assessment of the patient. A member of the study team will be nominated to conduct the MoCA to allow for consistency of delivery of the examination. The MoCA measures six cognitive domains: visuospatial/executive function; naming; memory; language; abstraction; and attention. To decrease the learning effect from multiple administrations of the MoCA over a short period of time, alternate versions have been made available.\n\n   The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) questionnaires are commonly used to assess cancer-related QoL issues. The FACT-Brain (FACT-Br) module provides an additional set of disease-specific questions pertaining to brain neoplasms and is completed by the patient.\n\n   Neurological assessments wil be made using the structured NANO scale at each physical examination - each neurological domain is subdivided into 3 or 4 levels of function with scores based on discrete quantifiable measures. Thus, levels of function for each domain range from 0 to 2 or 0 to 3. A score of 0 indicates normal function, while the highest score indicates the most severe level of deficit for that domain. Levels of function are distinguished by significant and measurable differences in order to avoid misinterpretation of subtle or nonspecific changes.\n\n   The EORTC QLQ-C30, an internationally validated cancer-specific QOL-instrument, assesses various facets of functioning, symptoms common in cancer patients and global QOL. The Brain Cancer Module (EORTC QLQ-BN20 is a 20-item supplement for the QLQ-C30 to assess neurological related quality of life and neurological symptoms and is being utilised in the main ABC study. Among the symptoms captured by neurocognitive tests are communication deficits and memory problems. In these cases, a patient-rated QoL tool may not capture the true effects of the disease or the intervention to treat it. Both C30 and BN20 modules have been validated for assessing health-related quality of life and symptoms in patients with brain cancer.\n\n   General health status will also be measured using the EQ-5D. The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of self-reported health status. The EQ-5D comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety) and a visual analogue rating scale (VAS). The utility data generated from the EQ-5D is commonly used in cost effectiveness analyses.\n6. TOXICITY AND TOLERABILITY Adverse events will be reported using the CTCAE version 5.0 in addition to causality, duration, treatment required and the need for treatment delays or discontinuation. Radionecrosis is an event of clinical interest and will be captured separately.\n7. CORRELATIVE BLOOD AND TISSUE BIOMARKER STUDIES Some patients may not benefit from radiation therapy and immunotherapy combinations. Therefore, biomarkers predictive of response. or the lack of it are needed. Extensive correlative analyses of tumoural and peripheral blood immunologic changes will be essential to a better understanding of the mechanistic interactions between these 2 treatment modalities. The differential composition of the gut microbiome has been shown to affect antitumor immunity and immunotherapy efficacy and will also be correlated with response and toxicity.\n\n   To address this, blood, tissue, stool and urine samples will be obtained. Blood will be collected at baseline, at 1 week of treatment and then 6 to 12 weekly to examine serum chemokines, cytokines, inflammatory markers, lymphocyte and T cell subsets and myeloid derived suppressor cells and to assess correlation with disease response or progression. All Cohorts will be included in this study.\n\n   In patients with sufficient archival melanoma tissue from metastatic sites, a baseline tumour PD-L1 level, immune markers and genetics of response and resistance will also be measured. If available, tumour tissue following progression of accessible extracranial disease and / or craniotomy will also be tested for immune and genetic markers.\n\n   Stool samples will be obtained at baseline, at weeks 6 and 12 and at the end of immunotherapy to investigate the gut microbiome composition, diversity and abundance and correlation with the response to immunotherapy and immune-related gastrointestinal toxicity. A baseline evaluation of participants' dietary habits will also be included in these analyses.\n\n   A reduction in intestinal barrier function is currently believed to play an important role in pathogenesis of many diseases, response to immunotherapy and immune related toxicity. Urinary excretion of two orally-administered non-metabolizable sugars, lactulose and mannitol, is a valuable marker for evaluating intestinal permeability. Patients will collect a urine specimen at baseline to assess this biomarker.\n8. CONTINUED SYSTEMIC TREATMENT IN CASES OF PROGRESSIVE DISEASE\n\n   The application of traditional RECIST criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) in patients treated with immunotherapy may lead to premature discontinuation of treatment in a patient who will eventually respond to treatment or have prolonged disease stabilization. Disease progression may occur in extracranial lesions whilst patients may continue to have disease stabilisation or response of their intracranial melanoma disease, and vice versa. The patterns of response to treatment with these immunotherapy agents differ from those with molecularly targeted agents or cytotoxic chemotherapy in several important respects:\n   * Patients may have a transient worsening of disease, manifested either by progression of known lesions or the appearance of new lesions, before disease stabilizes or tumour regresses. Therefore caution should be taken in abandoning therapy early. In general these delayed responses are not observed in patients with rapidly progressive, symptomatic disease.\n   * Responses can take appreciably longer to become apparent compared with cytotoxic therapy. Continued disease regression is frequently observed well after completion of the initial induction period.\n   * Some patients who do not meet traditional criteria for objective response can have prolonged periods of stable disease that are clinically significant.\n\n   An evaluation of data from ipilimumab phase II clinical trials in advanced melanoma found patients characterized as PD at week 12 (by WHO criteria), either by an increase in tumour burden and/or the appearance of new lesions, subsequently experienced an objective response or SD (relative to baseline) without the addition of non-ipilimumab anticancer therapy. Examination of biopsies taken from patients receiving ipilimumab demonstrated that in some small unmeasurable lesions noted at baseline, an increase in size may be interpreted as PD, when instead, this may be due to inflammation due to T cell infiltration.\n9. CONTINUED TREATMENT WITH NIVOLUMAB Patients who are found to have RECIST defined intracranial or extracranial progression (or both) from 6 weeks onwards, and who do not have clinical signs or symptoms of progression, may continue on nivolumab and must have a confirmatory scan within 4 to 6 weeks. The date of the original assessment of progression will be used to record progression, and not the date of the confirmatory imaging. Continued immunotherapy treatment is permitted if the treating clinician determines that the patient is still clinically benefiting from immunotherapy and the patient is willing to continue drug treatment. Consideration may be given to stable or good response extra- or intra- cranially with concurrent progression in the other as a scenario that may warrant further treatment.\n\nThere is growing evidence that patients may not need to be treated with immunotherapies indefinitely, or even for as long as the two years commonly studied in clinical trials. Rather, shorter courses of treatment may be just as effective and provide an option for retreatment should a patient progress after coming off a defined period of therapy. Patients who receive 2 years of immunotherapy have the option to cease treatment at this stage, with an option for a rechallenge of immunotherapy at the time of disease progression, if this occurs with 2 years of initial cessation.",

SX-682 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving SX-682 alone and together with nivolumab may kill more tumor cells.",
    "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the safety profile of CXCR1/2 Inhibitor SX-682 (SX-682) alone and in combination with nivolumab in subjects with refractory RAS mutated microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), including the maximum dose that can be administered until adverse effects prevent further dose increases (i.e., the maximum tolerated dose \\[MTD\\] or recommended phase 2 dose), and the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the efficacy of SX-682 in combination with nivolumab on the basis of the objective response rate (ORR), the duration of response, and the rate of progression.\n\nII. Characterize the single-dose and multidose pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SX-682.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess overall survival (OS). II. Explore potential biomarkers associated with pharmacodynamic and clinical response to SX-682 alone and combined with nivolumab, where the biomarker measures include, but are not limited to, tumor CMS4, gene expression, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutations (KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutation status via ribonucleic acid \\[RNA\\] and DNA sequencing), IRF2 (interferon regulatory factor 2) expression, lymphocyte clonality (via sequencing), myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSCs), regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and CD69/CD8 T cells, and in the circulation, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), T- and B-cell subpopulations, neutrophils, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), MDSCs, Tregs, the CD4:CD8 ratio, chemokines and cytokines.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of CXCR1/2 Inhibitor SX-682, followed by a phase II study.\n\nMONOTHERAPY STAGE: Patients receive SX-682 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nCOMBINATION STAGE: Patients receive SX-682 PO BID on days 1-56 and nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 29. Treatment repeat every 56 days weeks for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients with no have tumor response are followed up every 3 weeks for 90 days, and patients with tumor response every 3 months for up to 6 months.",

    "detailed_description": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients have a relatively high relapse rate and upon relapse the median overall survival is less than a year. No targeted therapies are currently available for this subgroup. Compared to other breast cancer subtypes, the percentage of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is significantly higher in TNBC. Given the durable responses induced by the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab in other advanced solid cancers, immunotherapeutic approaches, such as blockade of PD-1 by nivolumab may be the key to treat TNBC. Moreover, since classical anticancer agents can stimulate immune effector cells, the investigators hypothesize that short-term induction treatment with radiation, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide or cisplatin induces an anticancer immune response resulting in synergistic activity with nivolumab.",

Johns Hopkins piloted an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) platform using a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and partially HLA-mismatched (haploidentical) related donors for this population of pediatric and AYA solid tumor patients.With this strategy, investigators demonstrated that RIC haploBMT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) is feasible and has acceptable toxicities in patients with incurable pediatric and AYA solid tumors; thus, this approach serves as a platform for post-transplant strategies to prevent relapse and optimize progression free survival. In this trial, the central hypothesis is that the efficacy of alloBMT for high risk solid tumors can be improved by developing methods to augment donor T cell responses against antigens selectively or uniquely expressed by tumor tissue.\n\nInvestigators aim to demonstrated that Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1) blockade with nivolumab will be safe and well tolerated after RIC haplo BMT, initially in a relapsed population (Part A) and ultimately when given pre-emptively (Part B).",

In this trial we will implant a novel device with 9 ultrasound emitters allowing to temporarily and reversibly open the BBB immediately prior to chemotherapy infusion with albumin-bound paclitaxel.\n\nIn the phase 1 component, increasing doses of chemotherapy will be delivered as long deemed safe based on the prior patient not experiencing severe toxicity. Once the the recommended dosing has been established, carboplatin will be added to the regimen and additional patients will be treated in order to better evaluate the antitumor efficacy of this novel treatment.\n\nThe device will be implanted at the time of surgical resection of the recurrent tumor. During that procedure and when feasible, a first test dose of the chemotherapy will be administered in the operating room after sonication (procedure of activating ultrasound and opening the BBB) and tissue concentrations in different parts of the resected tumor will be measured. In select patients, the sonication procedure may occur immediately after the test dose of chemotherapy is administered.\n\nThe objectives of this trial are to establish a safe and effective dose of albumin-bound paclitaxel, to demonstrate that the opening of the BBB increases chemotherapy concentration in the tumor, and to estimate how effective this treatment is in reducing the tumor burden and prolonging life.",

During the tumor resection and when possible, an initial low dose of albumin-bound paclitaxel will be given following sonication. In select patients, the sonication procedure may occur immediately after the test dose of chemotherapy is administered. The sonication device will be implanted at the end of the procedure. In phase 1, about two weeks after surgery, patients will undergo sonication and albumin-bound paclitaxel administration with MRI to quantify extent of blood brain barrier opening. Sonication and administration of albumin-bound paclitaxel will continue every 3 weeks until disease progression. The planned albumin-bound paclitaxel starting dose is 40 mg/m2, to be escalated in the absence of significant toxicity up to 260 mg/m2. Blood samples for circulating tumor DNA will also be collected before and after each sonication. In phase 2, pre-sonication carboplatin at AUC 5 will be added to the regimen, with a safety run-in for the first 6 patients.",

    "detailed_description": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the intervention is being studied.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved nivolumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ipilimumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.\n\nResearchers hope to study the effects of the combination of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab. Many cancers use specific pathways (such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4) to evade the body's immune system. Nivolumab and ipilimumab work by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 pathways and thus releasing the brakes on the immune system so it can stop or slow cancer.\n\nIpilimumab and Nivolumab are both antibodies. An antibody is a cell that attaches to other cells to fight off infection. The antibodies in ipilimumab work by not allowing cancer cell growth. The antibodies in nivolumab work by causing programmed cell death of the cancer cells. Radiation therapy is believed to increase the likelihood of response of immunotherapy (the prevention/treatment of a disease through an immune response).\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are studying the combination of nivolumab, ipilimumab and radiation therapy on participants with microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, or MSI high colorectal cancer. The combination of these study drugs have been tested and optimized for safety and is currently being tested in multiple disease types. The study drugs have not been tested and optimized in combination with radiation therapy. The investigators believe that through the combination of the study drugs and radiation therapy the body may produce an immune response to stop the cancer cells from growing.",

Aromatase inhibitors (AI) are medications that prevent the formation of the hormone estrogen. They are used in the treatment of postmenopausal women who have hormone-dependent breast cancer. AI therapy prolongs life among patients with early-stage HR+ breast cancer. Many postmenopausal women stop AI therapy early due to debilitating joint pain (arthralgias). Non-Hispanic Black women are more likely to experience side effects and stop their hormonal therapy compared to Non-Hispanic white women. Acupuncture therapy involves inserting thin needles through the skin at specific points on the body to control pain. Acupressure therapy uses the application of pressure or localized massage to specific sites on the body to control symptoms such as pain. Acupuncture and acupressure are types of complementary and alternative medicine. Undergoing in-person acupuncture or participating in virtual acupressure may prevent AI-associated arthralgias (AIAA) in Non-Hispanic Black postmenopausal women with early-stage HR+ breast cancer.",

To compare the efficacy of acupuncture to the efficacy of acupressure among the study population.\n\nII. To determine if acupuncture or acupressure will increase AI adherence (secondary endpoint) among the study population at 6 months after starting adjuvant AI therapy.\n\nIII. To evaluate the acceptance, satisfaction, convenience, accessibility, and perceptions of in-person acupuncture and virtual acupressure.\n\nIV. To conduct 4 focus groups of 6-12 non-Hispanic Black women who receive 12 weeks of acupuncture or acupressure and collect and analyze qualitative data about barriers and facilitators to completing each intervention, transportation concerns, and ease or difficulty of completing each intervention.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients undergo acupuncture therapy in-person over 1 hour twice weekly for the first 6 weeks and then once weekly for 6 weeks and receive standard of care (SOC) AI therapy.\n\nARM II: Patients undergo self-administered acupressure therapy virtually over 1 hour twice weekly for the first 6 weeks and then once weekly for 6 weeks and receive SOC AI therapy.\n\nARM III: Patients receive SOC AI therapy.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed up for 12 months or until the initiation of new antineoplastic or investigational therapy, whichever occurs first.",

The drugs work by damaging the DNA in cancer cells, which can cause the cells to stop growing and die.\n\nRegorafenib is a type of drug called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). This drug targets the tyrosine kinase protein found in or on the surface of cancer cells that the cells need to survive and grow. Blocking this protein may stop cancer cells from growing, or cause them to grow more slowly or to shrink.\n\nThe study researchers think that combining nivolumab, FOLFOX, and regorafenib may be a more effective treatment for HER2-negative metastatic esophagogastric cancer than the usual chemotherapy treatment(s) alone.",

    "brief_summary": "Social determinants of health (SDoH), defined by the World Health Organization as \"the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live and age and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life\" are estimated to be responsible for nearly 90 percent of a person's health outcomes. SDoH are key contributors to racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in care healthcare access and health outcomes. The goal of this clinical trial is to identify patients with inflammatory arthritis or with a systemic rheumatic condition with arthritis who may respond to the simplest and least expensive intervention to address their SDoH-related needs- a tailored list of resources, those who benefit from a community-based resource specialist to help address specific needs, and those who require a nurse-trained navigator to help both coordinate the services provided by the community-based specialist, and their medical and mental health care and needs. The main questions the clinical trial aims to answer are:\n\n1. To test the efficacy of a rheumatology clinic-based nurse navigator and community resource specialist to reduce appointment no-shows and same-day cancellations in patients with systemic rheumatic conditions with arthritis.\n2. To examine the cost-effectiveness of each of the different study interventions for individuals with systemic rheumatic conditions with arthritis with SDoH-related needs using questionnaires and cost-related care metrics.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 arms. In Arm 1, patients will receive a cultivated list of resources related to the needs that patients indicate on the social determinants of health questionnaire. Arm 1 is the control arm which receives the current standard of care. In Arm 2, patients will receive the assistance of a community resource specialist (CRS) - an individual without formal medical training with community-based expertise. In Arm 3, patients will receive the assistance of a nurse patient navigator with additional systemic rheumatic condition-specific training who will work with the CRS.\n\nAfter 6 months, patients who do not respond to Arm 1 will move to Arm 2. Patients who do not respond to Arm 2, will move to Arm 3. Patients who do not respond to Arm 3 will remain in Arm 3. Patients who respond to any arm will graduate the program at 6 months. The patients who do not respond be in their new arm for 6 months. At 12 months, all patients remaining in the study will graduate.",
    "detailed_description": "Social determinants of health (SDoH), defined by the World Health Organization as \"the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live and age and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life\" are estimated to be responsible for nearly 90 percent of a person's health outcomes. SDoH are key contributors to racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in care healthcare access and health outcomes. Among patients with chronic rheumatic conditions, SDoH including poverty, insurance status, and inadequate access to care have been shown to contribute to delayed diagnoses, frequent emergency department visits, medication nonadherence, worse quality of life, increased disease-related damage and poorer outcomes. Individuals with inflammatory arthritis often require complex, costly medication regimens and suffer from a high burden of comorbid conditions and physical disabilities. They face unique healthcare challenges including a high risk of care fragmentation from multiple subspecialty providers and medications that are both expensive and challenging to adhere to as prescribed. The role of SDoH on the care and outcomes of patients with inflammatory arthritis is understudied but living conditions, socioeconomic status and neighborhood income have been shown to contribute to treatments received and the likelihood of remission at 12 months. Disparities in inflammatory arthritis care and outcomes are likely multifactorial and involve both delayed access to subspecialty care as well as ongoing barriers to sustained, high quality care once referred. Separate comprehensive interventions are required to address the challenges at every stage of care.\n\nOur ongoing quality improvement initiative aims to collect and document social determinants of health data for people with inflammatory arthritis across this multi-hospital system. In this initiative the investigators developed a standard of care where patients have their needs assessed and if they indicate that they would like information to help address these needs, they are sent resource lists. A community resource specialist is also available when indicated to help address needs. In this study, the investigators aim to test different interventions to address the needs that the investigators uncover using the SDoH screening protocol. Using an adaptive strategy, patients with SDoH-related needs and appointment no shows in the past, will be randomized to one of three arms, with the ability to change arms if they do not improve in their assigned arm. Cost-effectiveness analyses will also be conducted.\n\nUsing an adaptive intervention, this trial will help identify patients who may respond to the simplest and least expensive intervention - a tailored list of resources, those who benefit from a community-based resource specialist to help address specific SDoH-related needs, and those who require a nurse-trained navigator to help both coordinate the services provided by the community-based specialist, and their medical and mental health care and needs. A cost effectiveness analysis of the interventions will be conducted. The knowledge gained by this trial will help guide care and advocacy for vulnerable populations both in resource poor settings and at major medical centers that have not previously allocated the services needed to care for the highest risk populations. The overall goal of this study is to provide these essential data to advocate for a scalable, sustainable program to meet the needs of the most vulnerable patients with chronic rheumatic conditions with arthritis that can be scaled to other chronic systemic rheumatic diseases and other complex, subspecialty-managed conditions.\n\nSpecific Aims:\n\n1. To conduct a randomized controlled trial with an adaptive intervention to test the efficacy of a rheumatology clinic-based nurse patient navigator and community resource specialist intervention to reduce appointment no shows. This intervention will allow for an understanding of these needs and test three strategies to begin to address them. The investigators anticipate that all of the interventions will benefit to some degree through connection to resources. The investigators currently have no data as to whether one type of intervention is better than another for patients with systemic rheumatic conditions with arthritis and therefore, the investigators are testing two types of navigator interventions with the ultimate goal of determining the most beneficial and cost-effective intervention for high-risk patients based on their specific needs. The adaptive nature of the intervention will allow the study team to study this further and will allow for as many individuals as possible to derive potential benefit from this study.\n2. To examine the cost-effectiveness of each of the different study arms for individuals with systemic rheumatic conditions with arthritis with SDoH-related needs using the ED-5D questionnaire and cost-related care metrics.\n\nSubjects will be identified using the EHR (EPIC review, EDW, RPDR), and through BRASS. Rheumatologists will also be asked to refer patients who they feel may be appropriate. Patients will be recruited via patient gateway, by mail or by rheumatologist referral. Rheumatologists and the clinic nursing team will also be given fact sheets and recruitment letters that they can give to patients they feel might be interested in participating. If a letter is sent to a patient via gateway, via mail, or introduced by the rheumatologist, if the patient does not opt out, at least one week later, a member of the study team will call the patient to follow up. If they cannot be reached by phone but have a rheumatology clinic visit \\>=1 week after the letter is sent, a member of the research team may approach them in clinic to see if they might be interested in learning more about the study. The research assistants will be responsible for identifying and recruiting individuals beginning at the date of IRB approval. Communication for recruitment will occur in-person, through secure messaging in the EHR, through secure email (unless the patient opts out of secure email) and via the telephone. The patients enrolled in this study may have frequent appointment no shows and some may more frequently come to the Emergency Department or be admitted (either at BWH or at Faulkner). Therefore, the research team may approach patients for consent while they are in the ED or on an inpatient floor if unable to reach them by phone or in clinic. Similarly, the community resource specialist or nurse navigator may interact with the patients when they are in the ED or admitted due to the nature of their role (especially for those patients with frequent acute care use, who may also be those with the greatest SDoH-related needs).\n\nPrior studies have demonstrated that individuals who experience poverty and increased SDoH-related needs have an increased burden of rheumatic conditions, more severe outcomes, and increased care fragmentation. As such, the investigators aim to enroll individuals in this intervention who are at highest risk for adverse outcomes and high acute care use to address SDoH-related needs and improve receipt of outpatient care. The study team aims to include a racially and ethnically diverse patient population in this study. The investigators expect that more females than males will be enrolled because rheumatic conditions are more prevalent among females. The investigators expect that the majority of patients enrolled will be English-speaking given the ethnicity distribution of patients served in the rheumatology clinics at BWH (\\<10% identify as Latinx). To allow for the inclusion of Spanish-speaking patients, however, the study team has included translated materials.\n\nThe investigators anticipate recruiting 258 patients with systemic rheumatic conditions with arthritis across Mass General, Brigham and Faulkner hospitals and satellite rheumatology clinics to participate in the intervention components of this trial (N=86 per arm). Patients will be associated with the study in Epic so the study staff is notified if patients go to the ED or are hospitalized. The primary analysis will be intention-to-treat, and since the primary outcome metric can be obtained from the EHR, even if patients are lost to follow-up, the study team will still be able to collect these data. However, given the vulnerability of the patient population and potential loss to follow-up, the investigators will have statistical power to detect a clinically meaningful difference in medication and appointment adherence between the two intervention arms with 156 total patients (N=52 per arm) using a per protocol design, and examining secondary outcomes that require survey completion.\n\nStudy Team Interactions with Subjects Patients who agree to participate will be randomized to one of three arms. Arm 1 is the control arm which will receive the standard of care resource sheets. Patients in this arm will receive cultivated resource sheets for any SDoH-related needs that they screen positive for or request additional information on. Arm 2 will receive the assistance of a community resource specialist (CRS)- an individual without formal medical training with community-based expertise, who will help guide patients to the necessary community-based resources to help address their specific SDoH needs that impact their health and their ability to access sustained, high quality medical care. This may include forms to arrange for subsidized transportation to and from medical appointments or applications for Section 8 housing. The community resource specialist will reach out to patients in Arm 2 a minimum of 2 times per month, with more interactions guided by patients' needs. All outreach attempts and contacts will be documented in EPIC and in REDCap. Arm 3 will receive the assistance of a bilingual (English and Spanish) nurse patient navigator with nursing training and additional rheumatology-specific training who will both work with the CRS to connect the patient with community-based resources, independently connect the patient with relevant resources, and also help coordinate the patient's medical care and mental health needs. The nurse patient navigator will conduct her own needs assessment (the nurse navigator high risk assessment questionnaire at the time of the first conversation with the patient, originally developed as part of the MGB integrated care management program) and her actions will be guided by their responses. She will reach out to patients a minimum of 2 times per month with an increase in communication around patient appointments as reminders, and more frequent communication on a case-by-case basis depending on active illnesses, frequency of outpatient appointments, and needs of the patient. All outreach attempts and contact will be documented in Epic and REDCap and shared via EPIC with the care team as indicated.\n\nReassignments after 6 months After six months, individuals who do not respond to Arm 1 will be reassigned to the Arm 2 intervention (CRS). Response will be determined by \\>=1 appointment no shows or same day cancellations during the 6-month period and/or persistence of \\>=1 SDoH-related need that has not been addressed. Individuals without any no shows who had their needs addressed will graduate and will receive follow-up surveys at 12 months. Patients in Arm 2 or Arm 3 with no appointment now shows and who have had their SDoH-related needs addressed will graduate and complete follow-up surveys at 12 months. If individuals in Arm 2 had \\>=1 no show and/or persistent SDoH-related needs, they will be reassigned to Arm 3 (nurse navigator). If individuals in Arm 3 had \\>=1 no show and/or persistent SDoH-related needs, they will remain in Arm 3 for another 6 months. All individuals will complete 12-month surveys.",

    "brief_summary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about treatment for people with B-cell lymphoma that did not respond to treatment or that has gotten worse after treatment. The aim of this trial is to answer the following questions:\n\n* If it is realistic to give people radiation treatment before they receive a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell treatment for their cancer\n* If it is safe to give people radiation treatment before they receive a CAR T-cell treatment for their cancer",
    "detailed_description": "This is a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of low-dose radiation therapy in the bridging period between chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell collection, manufacturing, and infusion (vein-to-vein) in patients with relapsed and refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma.\n\nEmerging cellular immunotherapies including CAR T-cell therapy have produced remarkable outcomes for this population. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) for the management of people with relapsed and refractory B-cell lymphoma. Unfortunately, many patients undergoing liso-cel infusion will suffer progression or relapse with devastating consequences. The object of this study is to identify a novel means to enhance liso-cel activity to improve overall outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that the addition of radiation therapy targeting selected sites as bridging therapy prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy and liso-cel infusion will be effective at improving responses for patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell lymphoma.\n\nResults from this study will provide key justification to expand this therapeutic approach into a larger phase II clinical trial powered to examine the efficacy of this approach.",

    "brief_summary": "While the number of kidney transplants is increasing worldwide every year, there is a clear imbalance between the high number of patients in the waiting list and those receiving a transplant and importantly, among waitlist patients there is a progressively higher number of highly sensitised patients that have very low or even no chance to receive a compatible organ. These patients remain for very long periods of time on dialysis therapy, having lower quality of life, lower life expectancy and produce higher health-related costs. Unfortunately, current desensitization therapies have shown very poor success and patients usually lose these grafts very fast if transplanted across a positive cross-match. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel desensitization strategies capable of overcoming this immunological barrier and allow an increasing number of patients to receive a HLA-compatible kidney allograft.This is a non-randomized, single arm study, combination trial designed according to the Recommendations of the Clinical Trial Design Task Force of the NCI Investigational Drug Steering Committee. The study will enroll 12 patients with cPRA or TGI \u226599% on the deceased donor kidney transplant waiting list, who have not received a compatible donor offer for \\>3 year. According to inclusion and exclusion criteria patients will be screened to participate in the trial.",

    "brief_summary": "The current protocol will examine the use of a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding AR, alone or with T-cell checkpoint blockade, to induce and/or augment therapeutic T-cells following androgen deprivation in patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer scheduled to undergo prostatectomy. Patients without evidence of metastatic disease, with tissue remaining from a pre-treatment biopsy, and who are being considered for standard treatment by prostatectomy, will be invited to participate and will be on study for up to 15 months.",
    "detailed_description": "The original design of this protocol was to examine the use of a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding Androgen Receptor (AR), alone or with nivolumab, to induce and/or augment therapeutic T-cells following androgen deprivation in participants with newly diagnosed prostate cancer scheduled to undergo prostatectomy in one of three treatment arms. Based on emerging preclinical data that the timing of PD-1 blockade with the first immunization may be critical, and that combining PD-1 and LAG-3 blockade can improve the anti-tumor efficacy of vaccination in murine models of prostate cancer, the trial was amended to include two additional treatment arms testing the timing of PD-1 blockade and the addition of LAG-3 blockade. All participants will receive treatment with degarelix for 8 weeks prior to prostatectomy. In the first part of the study encompassing the first 3 treatment arms, participants will be also be randomized to receive either no additional treatment, a DNA vaccine encoding AR, or a DNA vaccine encoding AR and nivolumab. The additional arms will randomize patients to receive cemiplimab (PD-1 antagonist) with vaccine or cemiplimab with fianlimab (LAG-3 antagonist) and vaccine, with each agent initiated with the first immunization.\n\nParticipants receiving vaccination will begin that treatment prior to degarelix, based on preclinical findings that this may be a preferred sequence of treatment. The overall goal is to determine whether a DNA vaccine can augment the number of prostate tumor-specific infiltrating CD8+ T cells elicited with androgen deprivation, and whether this might be further augmented by combination with T-cell checkpoint blockade.\n\nBecause these cells should have cytolytic effector function, the primary clinical endpoint is pathological response (pCR and secondarily MRD) at the time of prostatectomy. This endpoint was chosen based on observations from previous clinical trials evaluating androgen deprivation therapies alone in this setting.\n\nSafety will also be a primary objective of the current study, as this vaccine and nivolumab have not been previously used in this early stage population. An additional secondary clinical endpoint will be 1-year PSA progression-free survival, after completion of all therapy, and with evidence of testosterone recovery.\n\nLaboratory and correlative endpoints will include whether vaccination, with or without concurrent T-cell checkpoint blockade, elicits greater numbers of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and whether AR-specific prostate tissue-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and persistent systemic immunity are detectable after treatment with vaccination. Other correlative studies will evaluate FLT PET/CT (Arms 1-3) as an investigational means of specifically identifying tumor infiltration by proliferating T cells as an early marker of treatment response, and whether uptake in other normal tissues is associated with autoimmune toxicity. While this is a relatively small trial, given a focus on correlative endpoints, a phase 2 expansion design was chosen to further evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy if pathological responses are observed in the initial part of the trial. If pathological responses exceeding 20% are observed, this will be considered significantly different from what has been historically observed, and would justify proceeding with future larger studies evaluating these combination approaches in the neoadjuvant stage of prostate cancer.\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\n1. To evaluate the safety of androgen deprivation and pTVG-AR DNA vaccine, alone or in combination with T-cell checkpoint blockade, in patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer\n2. To determine if pathological complete responses or minimal residual disease (MRD) can occur in patients with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation and pTVG-AR, alone or in combination with T-cell checkpoint blockade, prior to definitive surgery\n\nSecondary Clinical Objective:\n\n1. To estimate 1-year PSA progression-free survival (post-prostatectomy)\n2. To determine whether treatment with androgen deprivation and pTVG-AR DNA vaccine, alone or in combination with T-cell checkpoint blockade, leads to residual cancer burden (RCB) \\<0.25 cm3 at the time of prostatectomy\n3. To determine the median progression-free survival\n\nLaboratory / Correlative Objectives:\n\n1. To evaluate whether treatment with pTVG-AR elicits persistent systemic AR-specific Th1-biased T-cell responses\n2. To determine whether treatment with androgen deprivation and pTVG-AR elicits greater numbers of prostate tissue-infiltrating CD8+ T cells compared with androgen deprivation alone, and whether this is augmented with nivolumab, cemiplimab, or cemiplimab and fianlimab\n3. To determine if vaccination with pTVG-AR elicits AR-specific tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells\n4. To determine whether PD-1 +/- LAG-3 blockade treatment with androgen deprivation and vaccine increases the frequency of CD8+ T cells with memory and effector function, relative to exhausted phenotype, compared with androgen deprivation and vaccine alone\n5. To determine whether treatment elicits changes detectable by FLT PET imaging (Arms 1-3)\n6. To determine whether LAG-3 with PD-1 blockade and vaccination (Arm 5) elicits greater CD8 T cell infiltration compared to PD-1 blockade and vaccination alone (Arm 4)\n7.

Not all patients respond to these therapies however, and in some common cancers checkpoint blockade has failed to make any real impact. In 2014 there were over 41,000 new cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the UK and nearly 16,000 deaths from the disease, making it the second commonest cause of cancer death (Cancer Research UK Cancer Statistics Key Facts). 15% of patients with CRC develop it as a result of deficient mismatch repair (microsatellite instability - MSI): this cohort of patients respond well to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade as these tumours harbour a very high number of mutations thus increasing the likelihood of the presence of immunogenic neo-epitopes which elicit an immune response1. The majority of CRC patients, particularly those with metastatic disease (around 95%), do not display this hyper-mutator phenotype (microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC) and in these patients the results of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade have been disappointing.\n\nIn summary, MSS CRC patients with a class II expression appear to represent immunologically a group of MSI-like MSS patients that may respond to usefully to the immunotherapy agent nivolumab as a single agent and thus a trial of nivolumab in patients with class II expression of their cancer cells appears to be highly justified.",

    "detailed_description": "The incidence of stage II melanoma is significantly higher than for later stages of the disease, but stage II patients account for approximately 50% of all those who subsequently develop metastatic disease and die. Stage II melanomas have a Breslow thickness greater than 1.0 mm, with no clinical evidence of nodal, satellite or distant metastases. Pathological staging requires evaluation of the regional node basin after lymphatic mapping and sentinel node biopsy (SNB), which is required for N categorization of all \\>T1 melanomas. Compared to stage III disease, stage IIB and IIC have a worse prognosis than stage IIIA melanomas. Stage IIC even share the same poor prognosis as stage IIIB.\n\nGlobal management guidelines highlight the importance of an initial diagnostic biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of melanoma and to pathologically stage the tumour. After the diagnosis and Breslow thickness and other features have been established by histological assessment of the initial excision biopsy, the definitive management of primary cutaneous melanoma consists of surgical excision with a safety margin of surrounding skin and subcutaneous tissue. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) should be considered for melanomas \u2265 1 mm thickness (\u2265 0.8 mm if ulcerated or other high-risk features) in which case lymphoscintigraphy must be performed just prior to wider excision of the primary melanoma site.\n\nDespite the equivalent risk, the current standard of care for stage IIB/C melanoma is observation only although this is expected to change given the results from recent studies investigating adjuvant drug therapy in this stage. Importantly, systemic adjuvant therapy is standard for stage IIIB/C/D disease. Although patients with stage II disease contribute the largest population to melanoma-specific mortality, under the current treatment guidelines, these patients represent a population less likely to be treated in the adjuvant setting and have no representation in the neoadjuvant setting.\n\nPatients at low risk of recurrence with stage IIA disease (tumour \\>2-4 mm in thickness without ulceration \\[T3a\\], or \\>1 to 2 mm in thickness with ulceration \\[T2b\\]), have a high probability to be cured by surgery alone. However, the 5-year melanoma-specific survival (MSS) in stage IIA is 94%, which is comparable to the 93% of stage IIIB; patients with stage IIIA disease have a better prognosis than those with stage IIC disease. Patients diagnosed with higher risk stage IIB/C disease have thicker melanomas \\> 2.0 mm with ulceration, and \\> 4.0 mm with or without ulceration, respectively. These patients have an unmet clinical management need as there is no clear evidence for effective systemic adjuvant therapy to prevent disease recurrence once the primary tumour has been completely resected, which is the current standard of care for these patients. Approximately 15% to 20% of patients diagnosed with Stage IIB and 30% of patients diagnosed with Stage IIC melanoma will have a recurrence of their melanoma at 24 months. Within 5 years of surgical resection, approximately 25% of patients with Stage IIB disease and 40% of patients with Stage IIC disease will have disease recurrence. Among patients with stage IIB and IIC melanoma local recurrence occurs in 19 and 11% respectively; 45 and 58% experience regional recurrence and 44 and 39% have distant recurrence.\n\nPatients who present with localized disease and primary tumours of less than 2.0 mm with ulceration (T2b), or primary tumour of \\>2.0 to 4.0 mm without ulceration (T3a) are categorised as having stage IIA melanoma. A subset of these patients have a high risk of recurrence and may benefit from adjuvant treatment. Melanoma Institute Australia has developed a risk prediction tool which will be used to select this additional high-risk population (i.e., those predicted to be at \u2265 20% recurrence at 5 years, melanomarisk.org.au). The high-risk group is identified using the following variables: mitotic rate, (count) presence of ulceration (yes/no), Breslow thickness (mm), lymphovascular invasion (present vs. absent), SNB status (negative vs not known), presence of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), age (years), and sex (male vs. female).\n\nThe concept of moving immunotherapies from a more advanced setting where their efficacy has been well established, into a setting of stage II disease is well supported by the documented safety and efficacy data of these agents in the adjuvant setting. Introducing systemic treatment earlier in stage II disease is key to improving long term outcomes, but risk stratification is needed to identify those at most risk and manage the risk/benefit ratio given the potential immune-related toxicities.\n\nNeoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in melanoma (and several other solid tumours) is an area of active investigation with numerous completed and ongoing trials studying a variety of therapeutic interventions utilizing diverse designs. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy and targeted therapies results in a high recurrence-free survival rate (2-year RFS \\>95%) for pathological responders in stage III melanoma. Subsequent management can be personalised based on the neoadjuvant response to therapy and safely provides large amounts of tissue for analysis of resistance mechanisms from those who do not have a pathological response. The neoadjuvant platform also allows for the rapid testing of novel drug combinations informing decisions to proceed to phase III trials.\n\nGiven the similar outcomes with stage III melanoma, the findings from Keynote-716, and the positive results from neoadjuvant immunotherapy trials in stage III disease, introducing neoadjuvant therapy for stage IIB/C melanoma is an opportunity to improve outcomes with 2 doses of treatment 4 weeks apart. The pathological response to immunotherapy may aid the risk stratification and identification of which patients may benefit from adjuvant therapy. The pathological response to treatment is measured by the amount of residual, viable tumour tissue in the resected specimen. In accordance with the International Neoadjuvant Melanoma Consortium criteria, a complete pathological response (pCR) is demonstrated by the complete absence of residual viable tumour cells; a near pCR is \\<10% of residual tumour; a partial pathological response (pPR) is 10%-50% residual tumour and no pathological response (pNR) is the presence of \\>50% tumour cells.\n\nDual checkpoint inhibition with the distinct checkpoint inhibitors relatlimab and nivolumab results in enhanced T-cell effector function that is greater than the effects of either antibody alone in murine syngeneic tumour models. The ability of anti-LAG-3 to synergize with anti-PD-1 supports the utility of combined LAG-3 and PD-1 blockade. Anti-PD-1 has already demonstrated potent anti-tumour activity in multiple human malignancies, and it is envisaged that LAG-3, when co-administered with anti-PD-1, will enhance the anti-tumour responses and potentially broaden the spectrum of tumours responsive to anti-PD-1 treatment with an acceptable safety profile.\n\nHigh risk stage IIA and stage IIB/C resected melanoma represents a population of high unmet need due to the potential for locoregional, nodal or systemic recurrence, which dramatically impacts post-recurrence survival, especially in the case of systemic recurrences. Patients with stage IIB/IIC disease have a thick or ulcerated primary melanoma, with a 10-year overall survival (OS) of 82% and 75%, respectively, similar to that seen in stage IIIA and IIIB melanoma (88% and 77% respectively). In Australia, the current recommended standard of care for patients diagnosed with AJCC (8th edition) Stage IIB/C melanoma is observation.\n\nThe robust clinical activity demonstrated by nivolumab and relatlimab in patients with stage III and advanced melanoma, the manageable safety profile, and the lack of standard of care for patients who are at high risk for recurrence after a complete surgical resection of select stage IIA and stage IIB/IIC melanoma supports the further development of this drug combination in this population of patients.\n\nBased upon the improvements seen in PFS with the addition of relatlimab to nivolumab in RELATIVITY 047 and major pathological responses in neoadjuvant treatment of stage III melanoma, this study will investigate the pathological response to 2 doses of this novel combination immunotherapy (on days 1 and 294) in patients with AJCC stage IIB and IIC melanoma (i.e. stage II based on biopsy of the primary melanoma and a clinically negative \\[CT and ultrasound scan assessed\\] regional lymph node basin(s)). Melanoma Institute Australia's risk prediction tool will be used to select an additional high risk population from those with AJCC stage IIA melanoma in need of adjuvant treatment (i.e., those predicted to be at \u2265 20% recurrence at 5 years (melanomarisk.org.au).\n\nNeoadjuvant treatment will be followed by sentinel lymph node biopsy and complete surgical excision of the primary lesion at 6 weeks. Patients who have a pCR or near-pCR will undergo surveillance only. Remaining patients will receive adjuvant treatment with relatlimab 160 mg and nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks for 11 cycles (for an overall total of 13 cycles). Translational studies will be performed on tissue, blood and stool samples collected at baseline and at week 6 to identify potential predictors or response to drug and identification of potential biomarkers of recurrence. Data on the mechanisms of resistance to systemic therapies using tumour and liquid biopsy samples may lead to innovative treatment strategies to prevent resistance and improve outcomes in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings. Patients will be followed up for recurrence and survival for 10 years.",

Studies have shown that delay of surgical resection for 3-4 weeks after diagnosis is acceptable. Overall survival for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma are poor with the current treatment modalities available. Previously untreated, locally advanced (AJCC 8th edition stage III-IVa) HPV+ and HPV- head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients who are candidates for surgical resection, as deemed by the multidisciplinary team will be included in this trial. Patients with histories of autoimmune disease or with current or previous histories of immune modulating agents will be excluded from participation.\n\nRelatlimab will be given IV at a dose of 480 mg IV on D1 (and on D28 if surgery is postponed at the discretion of the investigator). Nivolumab will be given IV at a dose of 480 mg on D1 (and on D28 if surgery is postponed at the discretion of the investigator) when given alone or with relatlimab. Nivolumab will be given at dose of 3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks on D1 and D14 (and on D28 if the operating room time is not yet available, and the 4-week CT scan demonstrates at least stable disease ) when given with Ipilimumab. Ipilimumab will be given at a dose of 1 mg/kg IV once only on D1. Patients will undergo biopsy and CT scan prior to treatment initiation. 4 weeks (\u00b1 1 week) after, patient will undergo surgical resection. CT scan will be repeated prior to surgery (from 1-72 hours prior to surgery).The patients will be monitored from time of biopsy until 6 months postoperatively.",

The investigators want to find a safe dose of modified T cells for patients with this type of cancer that has progressed after standard chemotherapy. We also want to find out what effects these modified T cells have on the patient and their cancer.",
    "detailed_description": "There are 2 phases to the study: the Screening Phase and the Intervention Phase. Only patients identified as eligible from the Screening Phase may enroll in the Intervention Phase.\n\nScreening Phase: After signing Informed Consent 1 (Screening Informed Consent), the patient's MUC16ecto tumor expression will be determined as previously described. In order to be eligible for this protocol, the patient's ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube carcinoma must express the MUC16ecto protein detectable by IHC analysis of banked (paraffin embedded) or fresh biopsied tumor. After signing Informed Consent 1, approximately 2 weeks will elapse while the patient's banked tumor is tested for MUC16ecto expression. If a patient's tumor is found to express MUC16ecto, she will undergo leukapheresis for the collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), which will be frozen for future use. The leukapheresis product will be stored until the end of the study in case future research tests related to this study are developed.\n\nIntervention Phase: Patients must sign Informed Consent 2 (Intervention Informed Consent) before receiving treatment on the study before receiving treatment on the study.\n\nOnce the patient is eligible to receive the CAR+ T cells, the frozen leukapheresis product will be thawed and used to generate the 4H11-28z/fIL-12/EGFRt+ genetically-modified T cells. It is expected to take approximately 4-6 weeks to prepare the autologous CAR+ T cells.\n\nOn day 1-3 patients in cohorts V will receive conditioning chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m\\^2 or 300 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide concurrent with 25-30 mg/m2 fludarabine 2-7 days prior to the initial infusion of autologous CAR+T cells. Patients will receive autologous CAR+T cells in 2 infusions, the first IV and the second IP, each comprising about half the total dose. The IV infusion will be given first. The patient will then be closely monitored. One to 3 days later if clinically stable, the patient will receive the remaining dose of CAR+T cells IP. Patients in cohort I or -I will not receive cyclophosphamide, but will receive the T cells in the same manner (approximately half IV, followed by close monitoring and then 1-3 days later, if the patient is clinically stable, the remaining cells will be administered IP).",

Patients will be stratified based on IMDC criteria (intermediate 1-2 versus poor 3-6).\n\n* Standard Arm: induction ipilimumab 1 mg/kg combined with nivolumab 3 mg/kg (I/N) every 3 weeks for cycles 1-4 followed by maintenance treatment with nivolumab 240mg every 2 weeks or 480mg every 4 weeks until disease progression (as determined by RECIST 1.1), intolerance, or patient/physician decision to stop treatment.\n* Experimental Arm: induction ipilimumab 1 mg/kg combined with nivolumab 3 mg/kg (I/N) every 3 weeks for one cycle, followed by SBRT to the primary disease in-situ, prior to cycle 2-4 of I/N. Patients randomized to SBRT will undergo radiation planning during the first cycle of I/N to their primary kidney mass, and then the radiation will be delivered between cycles 1 and 2 to a dose of 30-40 Gy in 5 fractions every other day over 1.5 weeks. Approximately one week following completion of SBRT, patients will start cycle 2 of I/N as per standard of care. The total time elapsed between the start of cycle 1 and 2 of I/N should be no more than 6 weeks. After completion of up to four cycles of I/N, patients will proceed to standard of care maintenance treatment with nivolumab 240mg every 2 weeks or 480mg every 4 weeks until disease progression (as determined by RECIST 1.1), intolerance, or patient/physician decision to stop treatment.\n\nDuring treatment (standard and experimental arm) participants will be assessed for radiation toxicity and the occurrence of adverse events. Following treatment, participants will be assessed at a clinic visit every 3 months, for a period of 1 year. Progression free survival will be assessed by CT scan (chest; abdomen and pelvis), which is performed after the final I/N treatment and every 3 months as per standard of care. Participants will be followed for one additional year, seen at 18 and 24 months to assess survival. The planned sample size is 78 study participants.",

The choice of drug will be supported by a list of potential profiles, a molecular tumor board, a knowledge library and by study coordinators for review and approval of the match. The protocol-specified treatment will be administered to the patient once any drug-specific eligibility criteria are confirmed and a fresh pre-treatment biopsy is performed for future genetic studies. All patients who receive treatment with a drug available in the protocol will be followed for standard efficacy outcomes including tumor response, progression-free and overall survival as well as duration of treatment. In addition, treatment related toxicity will be evaluated.",
    "detailed_description": "Problem description: evidence is building that matching targeted agents to tumor characteristics can improve outcomes. Such reports have fueled interest among patients and physicians to use molecular testing for treatment planning when standard treatment options have been exhausted. When oncologists aim to provide such personalized treatment to their patients though, obtaining the drugs can be challenging since off-label prescribing, while legal, is generally not reimbursed by insurance companies. Furthermore, outcomes of off-label treatment in routine clinical practice are not systematically recorded. As a result, the research and clinical communities have limited insight in these outcomes, leading to repetitive use of ineffective treatment for some tumor types, while effective treatment strategies might be missed for others. The latter is especially relevant for 'orphan diseases', that are too rare to conduct formal phase II and III trials. In summary, there is a lack of access to potentially effective therapy on one hand, and a lack of knowledge on broader use of such therapies on the other, altogether leading to sub-optimal use of available resources.\n\nEnvisioned solution and study aim: creation of a drug-access program, in which patients are treated with registered targeted therapy matched to their molecular tumor profile, and in which the outcomes of such therapies are recorded systematically, per tumor profile and tumor type (this is important since it is becoming increasingly clear that the tissue of origin is an important determinant of outcome of genetic abnormalities). We hereby aim to improve and broaden the use of registered targeted therapy, whilst facilitating patient access to such therapy.\n\nPlan of investigation: patients will be treated with approved targeted agents, selected based on results of a molecular profiling test of the patient's tumor. Eligible patients will have exhausted standard treatment options, and their tumor must harbor a potentially actionable molecular variant as defined in the protocol. The study will provide a tumor board to help physicians understand the profiling test results and treatment options, and will enable insights about the utility of this approach. In addition, next generation sequencing will be performed on fresh tumor biopsies for additional biomarker discovery. Patients from the Netherlands and the USA will be included in two similar though independent protocols (DRUP and TAPUR), allowing data-exchange and empowering of both trials.\n\nExpected outcome: early signs of clinical activity of approved drugs outside their label, providing effective personalized treatment options, improved patient outcomes and access to targeted therapy.",

Phase I clinical trials test the safety of an investigational drug, or combination of drugs, and tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drugs to use for further studies. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug, or drug combination, to learn whether the drug or drug combination works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug combination is being studied.\n\nThis trial is studying the combination of tazemetostat, nivolumab, and ipilimumab in two parts:\n\n* Part 1: To find the safest dose of these three study drugs in combination for children with INI1- (or SMARCA4-) negative cancers who have completed upfront treatment\n* Part 2: To determine whether this combination can effectively treat INI1- or SMARCA4-negative cancers\n\nThe research study procedures include screening for eligibility study treatment, evaluation and follow-up visits. Participants will be asked to provide blood samples and undergo procedures that might be different from a regular medical examination. There are additional research samples that participants will be asked to consent for their collection.\n\nParticipants will receive study treatment for up to 2 years, as long as there is benefit or there are no serious side effects. Participants will be followed for approximately 2 years after stopping treatment.\n\nIt is expected that about 49 people will take part in this research study.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved this combination of three drugs for this specific disease. However, tazemetostat has been approved for use in epithelioid sarcoma (an INI1-deficient tumor), and the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab has also been approved for other uses. Separately, tazemetostat and the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab have also been tested in children and the safest doses of each drug (and the combination for nivolumab and ipilimumab) have been determined.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb and Epizyme, two pharmaceutical companies, are supporting this study by providing the study drugs.

During continuous treatment, dexamethasone 40 mg is used as a standardized premedication for Isatuximab.\n\nThe primary objective is to compare the efficacy of extended VRD + ASCT plus ERI (Arm B) vs. Isatuximab-VRD + ASCT (Arm A) in terms of proportion of patients who are MRD-negative by next generation flow cytometry (NGF) after 18 cycles + ASCT.\n\nThe primary endpoint, the MRD rate, takes as a reference the evaluation after the last extended VRD cycle, this is: 6 cycles for induction, 6 months for transplantation, 2 cycles for consolidation and 10 cycles until completing the 18 cycles of VRD, (in total about 24 months). For this reason,the primary endpoint in Arms A and C are established after a similar treatment time, which includes 4 cycles of induction, ASCT, 2 cycles of consolidation and 12 cycles of continuous treatment with Iberdomide plus Isatuximab (Dexamethasone to be determined).In patients of Arm B included in ERI, due to the great variability of the possible moments of incorporation in this therapeutic program, only rules are established for the moment and the realization or not of the transplant. The evaluation of the results will be carried out separately in the patients included, butalso in conjunction with the rest of the patients in Arm B to know the effect of the global strategy.\n\nAfter the evaluation of the primary endpoint, continuous/maintenance treatment continues in Arms A, B and C, including patients in ARM B assigned to the ERI program. Obtaining conventional CR in either arm will require a BM analysis for MRD. In the case of stable response or improvement without RC, MRD controls have been pre-established. Due to the lack of data on tolerance and adherence to long-term treatment with Isatuximab and Iberdomide, changes in the therapeutic programs, for this reason, a complete revision of the therapeutic program has been predetermined at the moment in which the last patient included in the clinical trial reaches 36 months of treatment. At this point, taking into account the updated knowledge about continuous or maintenance treatments, the strategies for a second clinical trial or an extension of this clinical trial will be defined.",

    "detailed_description": "This is a single-arm, phase II, multi-centre study of the safety and efficacy of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, nivolumab, as second-line or third-line salvage therapy, and in particular as a bridge to stem cell transplant (SCT) in relapsed/ refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma patients not achieving a complete metabolic response (CMR) on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan post first or second line salvage therapy.\n\nApproximately 120 patients with relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma will be registered while undergoing first or second line salvage therapy (first line is preferred).\n\nPatients will have a centrally reviewed PET CT scan after first or second line salvage therapy. Those with complete metabolic response (CMR) on PET CT scan (Deauville score 1-3) will not be eligible for trial treatment. They will be followed up for trial data collection purposes, and further management will be at their treating clinician's discretion.\n\nPatients achieving less than CMR on central review of FDG-PET (Deauville score 4-5) will be eligible to receive up to 8 x 2-weekly nivolumab infusions. 30 patients will be treated on the trial.\n\nAfter 4 courses of nivolumab, patients will have an additional centrally reviewed PET-CT scan (PET4). Patients achieving CMR will stop trial treatment, and enter follow up. Further treatment will be at their clinician's discretion but is likely to be stem cell transplant (SCT). Patients with partial metabolic response (PMR) or stable disease (SD) on PET4 will receive a further 4 cycles of nivolumab, again followed by a centrally reviewed PET-CT scan (PET8) to assess final response.\n\nFurther management after PET8 will be at the discretion of the treating clinician, although it is anticipated that those with CMR or PMR will proceed to SCT. If PET8 shows less than CMR (i.e. PMR or SD), patients who consent will have a further biopsy to exclude false positive PET signal; this will be centrally reviewed.\n\nPatients with progressive metabolic disease (PMD) on nivolumab at any point will stop trial treatment. If a repeat biopsy is obtained to confirm progressive disease histologically, the biopsy material will be centrally reviewed.\n\nPatients will be followed up for a minimum of 3 years.",

This double-blinded multicenter randomized pragmatic trial is designed to determine whether Zostavax or Shingrix are safe and effective in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) currently using anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapies. Inclusion/exclusion criteria for this sub-study mirror that of the parent VERVE trial with the exception of abatacept therapy being allowed. Preliminary data from the VERVE parent protocol enrolling patients using anti-TNF therapy is encouraging in that few patients experienced adverse events (56 adverse events in 50 participants, out of 140 participants in total) and that 96.2% of these adverse events were considered either mild or moderate. Importantly, there have been no instances of vaccine dissemination or zoster events to date.",
    "detailed_description": "Recently, a live-attenuated vaccine (Zostavax\u00ae, Merck) to prevent herpes zoster (HZ) has been developed and approved for use among individuals age 50 years or older, regardless of previous HZ or varicella history. In a pivotal study of 38,456 older adults led by Dr. Michael Oxman (a co-investigator in the parent VERVE trial and this immunogenicity pilot sub-study), the vaccine reduced the incidence of HZ and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) by \\> 50%.\n\nGuidelines from the American Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP), based largely on expert opinion (given the absence of data), recommend that patients who use methotrexate or low to moderate doses of corticosteroids (up to 20mg/day prednisone) can receive this vaccination safely. However, theoretical concerns regarding the safety of live vaccine use in patients using biologic therapies have resulted in an ACIP recommendation that the vaccine is contraindicated in patients receiving such medications. Similarly, given a lack of data, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) endorsed this contraindication in the updated ACR 2012 recommendations for biologic and non-biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) use in RA patients (led by members of the project team for this present application).\n\nCurrently it is unknown if RA patients using biologics can safely receive these vaccines. Despite the demonstrated efficacy and safety of the zoster vaccine observed in non-RA patients, there are no prospective data critically examining the efficacy or safety of HZ vaccination in RA patients. The zoster vaccine was not given to immunosuppressed patients in the large Shingles Prevention Study (SPS); RA patients and others receiving biologics and immunosuppressive agents including glucocorticoids and DMARDs were excluded. However, this trial did show safety of the vaccine even for very elderly individuals including those older than 70 years of age and with little evidence of remaining VZV-specific cell mediated immunity (CMI). Moreover, live varicella vaccine has been safely given to children with HIV infection. Recently, the investigators used the administrative databases of a national U.S. Healthcare organization (Aetna) to conduct an observational study to examining Zostavax use in patients with RA and other rheumatic diseases (e.g. spondyloarthropathies). Among a total of 19,326 RA patients older than age 50, only 206 (1%) received zoster vaccine, suggesting that clinicians may be uncomfortable using the vaccine in RA patients. Additionally, approximately 60 vaccinated patients were using anti-TNF therapies within one month of vaccination, and no cases of HZ were reported during this time frame. Some studies suggest an elevated risk of HZ in RA patients using anti-TNF therapies, although HZ cases reported within these cohorts of anti-TNF users do not show increased dissemination or complications, suggesting that anti-TNF therapy might not necessarily increase the likelihood of VZV dissemination in such patients. Theoretically, however, with downregulation of interferon-gamma pathways associated with TNF blockade, an increase risk of HZ might be expected in such patients. Lastly, limited head-to-head data collected to date suggests abatacept might carry less risk of HZ and other opportunistic infections than does anti-TNF therapy. Given the widespread use of anti-TNF and other biologic therapies like abatacept, many RA patients and rheumatologists are unwilling to stop biologic therapy in order to receive Zostavax. This represents a missed opportunity with regard to HZ prevention. Clearly, given the high risk of HZ in the RA population, it would be highly beneficial to prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of this vaccine in patients using biologic therapy.\n\nAn additional non-live vaccine, the adjuvanted recombinant glycoprotein E (gE) herpes zoster (HZ) vaccine (recombinant zoster vaccine; RZV; Shingrix\u00ae), has recently been approved for healthy immunocompetent adults \\>50 years old by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). In pivotal trials among healthy individuals, the vaccine was more than 90% effective in all age groups studied (\\>50 years) with a low incidence of serious adverse events. However, the vaccine displayed a high degree of reactogenicity with 15.6% of individuals suffering grade 3 or higher systemic reactions. While these reactions were self-limited and typically resolved within several days, patients with active immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (e.g. RA) were not included in these trials. There is concern that given the potency of the AS01B adjuvant in RZV and its subsequent reactogenicity, that vaccination with RZV could result in flares of underlying inflammatory diseases. Further, it is unclear how biologic therapy affects the immunogenicity or reactogenicity of this vaccine, and it is possible the efficacy of this vaccine will not be as high in immunosuppressed populations. Given RZV is a non-live vaccine, it theoretically has advantage over the currently used live shingles vaccine in which it is contraindicated to give to patients using biologic therapy. However, before such use is recommended, the vaccine should be evaluated in such populations.",

We plan to enroll 78 patients with biopsy-proven hepatic-limited metastatic colorectal cancer deemed resectable after multi-disciplinary discussion. Eligible patients must have confirmed isolated liver metastases by radiographic imaging of the investigators' choosing. Imaging must include the chest, abdomen, and pelvis regardless of imaging modality chosen. Patients will be randomized to either the control arm or the experimental arm. The control arm will receive mFOLFOX6 every 2 weeks for 4 cycles concurrently with Nivolumab. The experimental arm will first be treated with 2 vaccinations of MVA-BN-CV301 given two weeks apart (Days -28, -14) concurrently with Nivolumab followed by 4 vaccinations of FPV-CV301 given two weeks apart concurrently with mFOLFOX6 and Nivolumab, which will again be administered every 2 weeks for 4 cycles (FPV-CV301, mFOLFOX6 and Nivolumab) After Cycle 4, patients will be re-evaluated for surgical resection by re-staging CT chest, abdomen and pelvis (C/A/P). Patients still considered resectable will undergo surgical resection with the goal of complete resection. Patients who cannot be completely resected will continue to be followed on study, and an additional appropriate candidate will be randomized to the corresponding arm.\n\nWe will collect peripheral blood and tumor tissue at the time of surgical resection, if applicable, or by re-biopsy if resection is not possible. Post-operative therapy will begin when patients are deemed ready by their surgical oncologist team. Patients in the control arm will then undergo another 8 cycles of mFOLFOX6 with Nivolumab administered concurrently. Nivolumab will then be administered every four weeks. The experimental arm will receive the same post-operative regimen but including FPV-CV301 boosters given concurrently with mFOLFOX6 and Nivolumab. FPV-CV301 will then be administered every 12 weeks, and Nivolumab every 4 weeks. We will collect peripheral blood for evaluation of correlates upon the completion of therapy. The vaccination approach of initial immunization during the neoadjuvant period followed by FPV-CV301 boosters for two years postoperatively was chosen to optimize the induction of a long-lasting tumor-specific host response. Neoadjuvant vaccination will also allow for analysis of the tumor microenvironment in resection specimens.\n\nPost-therapy patients will be under surveillance per NCCN guidelines with repeat CEA every 3 months for 2 years followed by every 6 months for 1 year (total 3 years), repeat CT of the C/A/P every 3 months for 2 years followed by every 6 months for up to 1 year (total 3 years), and colonoscopy at one year with repetition based on findings at the time of the procedure.",

    "detailed_description": "According to international guidelines, outside clinical trials, frontline autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is the standard of care for fit patients less than 71 years of age, who are newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma.\n\nTriplet combinations are now the backbone of induction therapy prior to ASCT. KRD (Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, Dexamethasone) is potentially the more active regimen.\n\nQuadruplet combinations are under evaluation. The prospective phase 3 CASSIOPEIA trial conducted by the IFM and HOVON cooperative groups investigated the outcome of transplant-eligible patients treated with VTD (Bortezomib, Thalidomide, Dexamethasone) +/- Daratumumab administered both before (induction, 4 cycles) and after (consolidation, 2 cycles) single ASCT prepared by Melphalan 200 mg/m2.5 The addition of Daratumumab to VTD during induction induced significantly higher response rates, but also higher minimal residual disease (MRD) - negativity rates. The high response rates achieved after induction (MRD negativity rates at 10-5 by 8-color flow cytometry 35% (188/543) in the VTD-Dara arm vs 23% (125/542) after 4 cycles of VTD in the intent-to-treat population), but also after consolidation and before maintenance (MRD negativity rates at 10-5 by 8-color flow cytometry 63% in the VTD-Dara arm vs 43% in the VTD in the intent-to-treat population), translated into a significant improvement in progression-free-survival (PFS) in the Daratumumab arm of the study: 18-month PFS 93% vs 85% before maintenance, HR 0.47 (0.33-0.67), p \\< 0.0001. Cassiopeia is the first study showing a correlation between MRD negativity after induction (before ASCT) and PFS benefit, in the setting of quadruplet combination induction. Based on these results, VTD + daratumumab was recently approved by the FDA and EMA.\n\nKRD has also been combined with Daratumumab in several phase 2 trials. Early results indicate that this quadruplet combination might potentially be the most effective regimen prior to ASCT in terms of response and MRD-negativity rates. Carfilzomib was administered intravenously weekly, on days 1, 8 and 15 of 28 day-cycles at the dose of 56 mg/m\u00b2. Based on 70 patients, the MRD-negativity rate after four cycles of KRD-Daratumumab was 39% at a detection level of 10-5 by next generation sequencing (NGS). The weekly KRD-Daratumumab regimen was associated with low toxicity, and stem cell harvest was adequate. The rate of MRD negativity in 42 patients further improved after single ASCT, to 67% and 43% at a detection level of 10-5 and of 10-6 by NGS, respectively. Due to the short 7.9 months median follow-up time at the time of presentation, no PFS data were presented. At ASCO 2020, Weisel et al reported the results of induction based on 6 cycles of KRD plus Isatuximab, in patients with high-risk cytogenetics.8 In this interim analysis on the first 46 patients eligible for ASCT with high-risk disease, the overall response rate was 100%, including 60% MRD negativity at 10-5 by NGS after induction and before ASCT. No death on study was reported. No data are yet available regarding MRD negativity rates after ASCT or PFS. At ASH 2019, Landgren et al. reported the results of eight weekly KRD-Daratumumab cycles without ASCT in a small phase 2 study on 41 patients after a short median follow-up time of 8.6 months.\n\nOn the same intent-to-treat basis, MRD-negativity rate at a detection level of 10-5 by NGS was 61% and 65% in patients after six and eight cycles, respectively, including a very good partial response (VGPR) rate or better of 85% after 8 cycles and an overall response rate (ORR) of 100%. No death on study was seen. At the time of the report, no patient with MRD-negative disease had progressed. Despite the short follow-up time, based on the high rate of MRD-negativity and the 0% relapse rate achieved so far with this quadruplet combination, the authors of this small phase 2 series now propose to systematically delay ASCT in patients with standard-risk disease. This provocative recommendation requires validation in a phase 3 randomized trial comparing frontline versus delayed ASCT in patients with MRD-negative disease after induction.\n\nPatients MRD positive after quadruplet induction are at higher risk of disease progression. For patients with high-risk (HR) disease, tandem ASCT has been proposed in order to improve PFS and overall survival (OS). In an integrated analysis of four phase III studies independently conducted by HOVON/GMMG, IFM, PETHEMA/GEM and GIMEMA European cooperative groups, in the era of Bortezomib-based induction regimens, double ASCT significantly improved PFS and OS in HR patients.\n\nIn the EMN02/HO95 study, in centers with a policy of double ASCT, patients were assigned to receive VMP (Bortezomib, Melphalan, Prednisone), single ASCT (ASCT-1) or two planned ASCTs (ASCT-2) to prospectively compare ASCT-1 with ASCT-2. Patients who received ASCT-2 had a prolonged PFS compared to those who received ASCT-1. Importantly, ASCT-2 overcame the adverse prognosis conferred by high-risk cytogenetics. In the same study, OS from the first randomization was significantly prolonged with ASCT-2 as compared with ASCT-1, a benefit also seen in subgroups of patients with adverse prognosis, including those with R-ISS stage II+III and high-risk cytogenetics. To date, no prospective trial has compared single vs tandem ASCT in HR patients in the era of quadruplet induction combinations.\n\nAfter ASCT, a systematic maintenance is recommended by International Guidelines. Lenalidomide is approved in this setting, and proposed until progression. Other agents or combinations are under evaluation for maintenance, such as Ixazomib, Elotuzumab, Daratumumab or Isatuximab. Iberdomide is a next generation cereblon targeting agent, with antitumor and immunostimulatory activities in Lenalidomide- and Pomalidomide-resistant multiple myeloma. This oral agent, which could be the ideal agent for maintenance therapy, is currently tested after ASCT. Phase 2 and 3 randomized studies are currently investigating the combination of Lenalidomide with anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies as maintenance therapy after autologous stem cell transplant. We assume that a fixed duration of maintenance using Iberdomide and Isatuximab will induce a high-rate of sustained MRD negativity.",

    "detailed_description": "The optimal scheduling of targeted and immune therapies in metastatic melanoma is unknown. At present, patients are treated with targeted therapy until acquired resistance develops, and then switched to immune therapy. Pre-clinical data has revealed that BRAF inhibition results in an environment that can enhance immune responses. Tumours responding to BRAF inhibitors but not resistant have been shown to have increased T cell infiltration, improved T cell recognition of melanoma associated antigens and reduced production of immunosuppressive cytokines. Furthermore, in response to targeted therapy LDH levels, which are associated with decreased response to immune therapy reduces, which may improve efficacy of immunotherapy.\n\nA precise definition of response is required in order to decide upon a switch to immune therapy. A radiological definition of response is currently the standard assessment. However a scan at a fixed time point of 2 or 3 months does not reflect the wide range of response dynamics or allow decision making on an individual patient basis. The investigators have developed techniques using circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in the metastatic setting, which are able to accurately monitor tumour burden over time.\n\nThe aim of this pilot study is to provide a signal as to whether:\n\n1. In BRAF mutant melanoma the efficacy of immune therapy is enhanced by response to pre-treatment with MAPK pathway inhibition with dabrafenib + trametinib.\n2. Changes in ctDNA levels can be used to accurately inform when to switch from targeted to immune therapy.\n\nData from this study will provide the basis for follow on studies with sufficient power to assess whether tumours responding to BRAF inhibition as defined by response in ctDNA can improve efficacy of immune therapy.",

Therefore, new approaches to decrease the time on ADT are crucial to improving quality of life for men with prostate cancer.\n\nOnce initiated, ADT can be given either continuously or intermittently. However, even with an intermittent approach the ADT-free interval typically decreases with each cycle and most men eventually develop castration resistance.

Patients will be assigned to treatment arms based on their diagnoses and treatment histories. For 9 patients, a PK Run-in period will precede Cycle 1 (DLT evaluation) to assess selinexor PK when co-administered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. In the Dose Escalation Phase (Phase 1): (a) in Arm 1 (SPd), Arm 2 (SVd), and Arm 3 (SRd in RRMM), patients will be randomized to either QW or BIW selinexor dosing cohorts; (b) in Arm 5 (SDd), patients will be sequentially assigned in blocks of 3 to either QW or BIW selinexor dosing; (c) in Arm 4 (SPVd), Arm 6 (SKd), Arm 7 (Srd in NDMM), Arm 8 (SNd), Arm 9 (SPEd), Arm 10 (SBd), Arm 11 (SDPd), and Arm 12 (SMd) patients will be assigned to QW selinexor dosing.\n\nCohort 1.4 is included from Version 10 to study safety and tolerability of SPd with selinexor 40 mg QW, is lower than RP2D (ie, selinexor 60 mg QW) in combination with pomalidomide 4 mg. Cohort 1.4 is a different expansion cohort from the one with RP2D (ie, Cohort 1.3). In Cohort 1.4, 20 patients will be enrolled in total.\n\nStarting in protocol Version 8.0, patients enrolled to the Dose Escalation Phase of Arm 4 (SPVd), Arm 6 (SKd), Arm 8 (SNd), Arm 9 (SPEd), Arm 10 (SBd), and Arm 11 (SDPd) will first be enrolled to a 14-day PK Run-in period (selinexor +/- clarithromycin) until 9 patients have been enrolled. During this 14-day PK Run-in period, selinexor 40 milligrams (mg) will be administered alone on Day 1, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (BID) will be administered on Days 2-8, and selinexor 40 mg will again be administered on Day 8 with the morning clarithromycin dose. Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected pre-dose and 1 (\u00b1 10 min), 1.5 (\u00b1 10 min), 2 (\u00b1 10 min), 3 (\u00b1 10 min), 4 (\u00b1 10 min), 5 (\u00b1 10 min), 6 (\u00b1 10 min), 8 (\u00b1 10 min), and 24 h (\u00b1 30 min) hours after selinexor is dosed on Day 1 (without clarithromycin) and Day 8 (with clarithromycin).

The researchers hypothesize that the combination of Iberdomide and Elotuzumab will synergize to promote myeloma cell death, resulting in an overall response rate of at least 53%, with an acceptable safety profile. Patients will be enrolled in a 3+3 dose escalation cohort to evaluate the safety of this combination and to establish the MTD (maximum tolerated dose). The MTD will be the dose for the patients enrolled in dose expansion cohort. A total maximum of 37 patients will be recruited: maximum 18 patients will be recruited in the dose escalation phase, followed by an additional 19 patients in the dose expansion cohort for a total of 25 patients treated at the MTD.",

During this phase, the maximum tolerated dose of Iberdomide in combination with Elotuzumab and Dexamethasone will be determined and recommended for the dose expansion cohort.\n\nPart 2 of this study is an open-label, single-arm dose expansion cohort that will enroll additional patients at the recommended maximum tolerated dose of Iberdomide as determined in Part 1. Researchers will continue to verify the safety and tolerability of this combination and examine the anti-myeloma activity of the regimen. In addition to measuring overall response rate, duration of response, and survival data, researchers will explore the effect of this combination on the biology of multiple myeloma and the immune system in order to gain insight into patterns of response that may help predict patient population most-likely to benefit from this treatment in the future.",

However, the concept that tumors evade immune surveillance through a variety of mechanisms, and that activating the immune system can lead to tumor regression in a variety of tumor types has been known for decades. Thus, this study combines the effects to blocking 2 different pathways- inhibition of PD-1 pathway and angiogenic pathway via inhibition of VEGR signaling to improve survival as blocking each pathway individually has demonstrated a modest increment. There has been no study using nivolumab in combination with a VEGFR2 inhibitor, a drug which has both anti-angiogenic and pleotropic immunomodulatory effects and may synergize with the effect of an anti-PD-1 agent, in solid tumors. Activating the anti-tumor effects of T cells by utilizing multiple pathways of both nivolumab and ramucirumab is an endeavor which merits investigation.\n\nThus, the study investigates the synergistic effect of targeted anti-antitumor activity of immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab and immune-suppressive activity of VEGF-inhibitor ramicirumab expecting a favorable overall survival in NSCLC patients, with the additional benefit of tolerable toxicities.",

    "detailed_description": "Approximately 30% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) present with resectable disease, but following surgery, the majority will experience relapse and death from the cancer. Despite significant advances in therapy for advanced NSCLC, no new systemic neoadjuvant therapies have been approved for resectable NSCLC without an EGFR driver mutation in over 15 years, and these patients are in critical need of new treatments to improve rates of cure. Currently, the standard approach for resectable stage II and III disease is 3-4 cycles of pre- or postoperative chemotherapy, which provides an absolute 5-year survival benefit of only 5% over surgery alone.\n\nNeoadjuvant systemic therapy provides an opportunity to improve outcomes with surgery at a similar rate to adjuvant therapy, and is a more useful platform for advancing the development of new targeted and combination therapies. Pathologic complete response (pCR) and major pathologic response (MPR, \u226410% residual viable tumor) in the resected specimen serve as surrogate endpoints for event-free and overall survival, and are useful early efficacy endpoints to accelerate drug development. In resectable NSCLC, the rates of pCR and MPR with neoadjuvant immunotherapy alone are about 10% and 45% as compared to 4% and 20% with current standard of care chemotherapy. The recent approval of osimertinib in resected EGFR-mutated NSCLC has demonstrated the efficacy of targeted therapy in resectable disease, but is only available to a small minority of NSCLC patients.\n\nKRAS is the most commonly mutated oncogene in cancer representing a vast unmet clinical need, particularly in NSCLC where it is associated with smoking history and mutated in 30% of lung adenocarcinomas. Activating KRAS mutations promote signaling pathways for growth, survival and differentiation. The most common mutant allele is KRAS G12C, present in 1 in 8 patients with NSCLC (12.5%), and represents an aggressive NSCLC phenotype with significantly higher risk of recurrence following resection in stage I-III disease.\n\nAdagrasib is a novel small molecule inhibitor of KRAS G12C producing potent inhibition of KRAS-dependent signal transduction with high selectivity. Adagrasib has shown promise in advanced NSCLC, with 45% confirmed objective response rate and 96% disease control rate in the phase 1/2 KRYSTAL study.\n\nFinally, the investigators anticipate enhanced efficacy of Adagrasib in combination with immune checkpoint blockade. Emerging clinical data suggests that Adagrasib reconditions the tumor immune microenvironment to become more immune-sensitive (e.g. in immune \"cold\" STK11 co-mutated tumors), and combination treatment with anti-PD-1 therapy resulted in increased durable responses compared to either agent alone in a murine model. Adagrasib is well-tolerated and has been safely combined with anti-PD1 therapy in a phase I trial. This will be the first study to bring this combination forward in resectable lung cancer.\n\nThis phase 2 clinical trial investigates the role of targeted KRAS G12C inhibition with and without the anti-PD-1 agent nivolumab in resectable NSCLC",

Phase 2 clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of investigational drug(s) to learn whether the drug(s) work in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug(s) are being studied.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved nivolumab for hormone sensitive prostate cancer. However, nivolumab has been approved for other uses, including for advanced melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, kidney cancer, and bladder cancer.\n\nThe U.S. FDA has not approved docetaxel as a treatment option for hormone sensitive prostate cancer. However, docetaxel is approved for advanced hormone resistant prostate cancer and other cancers. There is also evidence from a high quality, phase 3 randomized clinical trial supporting the use of docetaxel in metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer patients who have a high burden of metastasis. Docetaxel is an off-label indication for hormone sensitive prostate cancer.\n\nThe U.S. FDA has approved androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) agents, including leuprolide (Lupron), goserelin acetate (Zoladex), or degarelix (Firmagon), as a treatment option for hormone sensitive prostate cancer.\n\nThe combination of ADT, also called hormonal therapy, with docetaxel chemotherapy and nivolumab immunotherapy is considered investigational. ADT cuts off the supply of testosterone and is the standard of care for hormone sensitive prostate cancer. The addition of docetaxel chemotherapy has been found to prolong life for prostate cancer patients starting hormonal therapy for the first time for metastatic disease, who also have a large volume of cancer.\n\nAnother anti-cancer treatment modality is called immunotherapy. The immune system can kill cells that are recognized as different or dangerous, such as infected cells and cancer cells. Nivolumab is an antibody (a type of human protein) that work to stimulate the body's immune system to recognize and fight cancer cells.\n\nHormonal therapy and chemotherapy may make cancer cells more recognizable to the immune system, and make cancer cells more susceptible to immunotherapy. The goal of this study is to examine the activity and safety of hormonal therapy combined with docetaxel chemotherapy and nivolumab immunotherapy for hormone sensitive prostate cancer. The study is designed to enrich for patients whose tumors may be more most responsive to this treatment strategy. All patients will receive the same treatment of ADT combined with docetaxel chemotherapy and nivolumab immunotherapy.",

    "detailed_description": "Gliomas are the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults. Their clinical presentation is heterogeneous and prognosis is dependent on both the grade of the tumor and the molecular subtype. Somatic mutations in Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or, less commonly, Isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) genes have emerged as an important prognostic factor in gliomas and are associated with longer survival.\n\nRegardless of initial grade, recurrence and transformation into higher grade tumors is almost universal. There is high unmet medical need in treating recurrent gliomas as there is currently no established standard of care therapy. Recent trials of IDH inhibitors in IDH mutant gliomas and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and PD-L1 inhibitors in recurrent gliomas have been disappointing. Multiple studies in other cancers have demonstrated that hypermutated tumors are associated with response to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti-CTLA4 agents in melanoma, anti-PD1 therapy in bladder cancer, and anti-programmed-cell-death protein 1 (anti-PD1) therapy in lung, and colorectal cancer.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that gliomas with somatic IDH mutations are more prone to develop hypermutation after exposure to alkylating agents than IDH wildtype tumors, providing strong scientific rationale for establishing nivolumab as a treatment option in this subgroup of patients.",

Data obtained in this study will provide valuable information for planning further prospective clinical trials of anti-PD-1 and other immunotherapies in NSCLC, both in the peri-operative and advanced disease setting. Ultimately, it is highly desirable to discover prospective biomarkers of response and toxicity to allow patients with NSCLC who are most likely to derive benefit to receive anti-PD-1 treatment, and conversely to minimize the risk of toxicity and ineffective treatment for patients who are unlikely to benefit.\n\nIn addition, an amendment to this study allows evaluation of the combination of nivolumab and the anti-CTLA4 antibody, ipilimumab in the neoadjuvant setting for the treatment of resectable NSCLC. In a large, multicohort, phase 1 trial, the ORR to combination ipilimumab and nivolumab therapy in patients unselected by PD-L1 status ranged from 39-47%. Incidence of grade 3-4 toxicity ranged from 33-37% across the combination ipilimumab and nivolumab cohorts which compares favorably with the rates of toxicity due to platinum doublet chemotherapy in this disease setting.\n\nThe current amendment includes addition of a third arm (Arm C) combining nivolumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting.",

    "detailed_description": "This is a single arm, multi-centre, phase II open label study of nivolumab with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for early stage non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nCurrent United Kingdom (UK) guidelines for SBRT do not specify exclusion pulmonary function criteria. Severely reduced Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (\\<40% predicted) are common reasons for medical inoperability leading to the choice of SBRT. In a large prospective study of patients undergoing SBRT, poor baseline PFT was not predictive of toxicity including pneumonitis. At the 2 year follow up, the mean decline in percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) were only 5.8% and 6.3% respectively. Focal SBRT is a well-tolerated procedure and acute complications are generally transient. Symptomatic radiation pneumonitis has been reported at rates of 4-25% of patients.\n\nDrug induced pneumonitis is reported at 6% in lung cancer patients receiving nivolumab and at 2% with grade 3-4 toxicity. Of note, such rates are similar or lower to other drugs used in NSCLC including docetaxel for which no PFT restrictions occur. In this study, frequent assessment of spirometry values may help to predict patients that are developing subclinical pneumonitis and prompt for early intervention.\n\nSBRT will be delivered in either 3 or 5 fractions for peripheral disease or 8 fractions in central disease. A flat dose of 240 mg nivolumab infusion will begin after the final fraction of SBRT, within 24 hours and typically on the same day. Nivolumab will subsequently be given every 2 weeks at a flat dose of 240 mg for a further 13 cycles followed by Nivolumab 480mg Q4W for 7 cycles until 20 cycles in total are complete, unless any study drug discontinuation criteria are met. The study will recruit 31 patients. We anticipate it will take approximately 18 months to recruit 31 patients.\n\nThe study will include subjects with histologically verified NSCLC deemed by a local multidisciplinary team (MDT) to have anatomical stage T1-3 \\[\u22646cm\\] N0 M0 by means of computed tomography (CT) and fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) , amenable to radical treatment with SBRT and inoperable due to medical co-morbidity, being technically unresectable or patient declining surgery after offer of surgical assessment.\n\nSubjects will receive nivolumab as per the treatment schedule unless any withdrawal criteria are met. The first nivolumab infusion will be given after the final fraction of SBRT, within 24 hours and generally on the same day. Clinical follow up and investigations are as detailed in the schedule of assessment.\n\nThe first 5 patients to enroll must have Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) \\< 2 at the time of first dose of investigational medical product (IMP). An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will meet when the first 5 patients have reached 3 months follow up from their 1st dose of nivolumab or have withdrawn consent to follow-up. Patients that have enrolled but did not receive IMP will be replaced. The IDMC, if satisfied with the safety data from the initial 5 patients, may recommend escalation to include recruitment of patients with ECOG performance status of 2. Further patients of PS \\<2 may enroll while awaiting the outcome of the IDMC meeting.\n\nThe IDMC will perform a further safety review when the first 5 patients enrolled with ECOG performance status 2 have reached 3 months follow up from their final fraction of radiotherapy or have withdrawn consent to follow-up. Patients that have enrolled but did not receive IMP will be replaced. Further patients with ECOG performance status 2 will not be able to enroll unless recommendation is given by the IDMC. In the event that 5 PS 2 patients have not enrolled by the point that the 15th recruited patient has reached 3 months follow up, then there will be a further mandated IDMC meeting to assess safety data from the study. Patients may continue to enroll while awaiting the outcome of this IDMC meeting.\n\nAssessment of toxicities will be performed at each clinic visit during treatment, at 30 days after the final nivolumab infusion and until 100 days after the final nivolumab infusion. Changes in spirometry values and PFTs will be assessed throughout the trial.\n\nRelapse rates will be assessed with staging CT scans at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post SBRT.\n\nAn exploratory assessment will be made of the effect pre-treatment pulmonary function tests (PFTs) have on outcome measures.",

    "detailed_description": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the intervention is being studied.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved nivolumab for your specific disease but it has been approved for other uses. The FDA has approved carboplatin as a treatment option for your disease.\n\nThe purpose of this research study is to determine how well carboplatin, by itself, or together with nivolumab, works in treating breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Nivolumab is a recently discovered human monoclonal antibody. An antibody is a type of protein that your immune system (the system that defends your body against potentially harmful particles) uses to find and destroy foreign molecules (particles not typically found in your body, such as bacteria and viruses). Scientists can now make antibodies in the laboratory and produce them for the treatment of many different diseases.\n\nNivolumab works by attaching to and blocking a molecule called PD-1. PD-1 is a different molecule that can turn off the immune system by interacting with PD-L1 on the cancer cell. Nivolumab has been shown in research studies to prevent PD-1 from shutting down the immune system, thus allowing it to recognize and help your body destroy the cancer cells. You are being asked to participate in this study because triple-negative breast cancer has shown elevated rates of PD-L1 expression.\n\nNivolumab has been used in other research studies and information from those research studies suggests that nivolumab may help shrink or stabilize your triple negative breast cancer in this study",

Among the MMR-deficient cancers, the best antitumor responses are often associated with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H status), higher tumor mutational burden (TMB), and higher predicted neoantigen load. Prevalence estimates of MMR deficiency across solid tumor types range from 1% to 20% depending on the type of malignancy. In prostate cancer, 1-3% of unselected cases harbor MMR deficiency and/or microsatellite instability.\n\nFor men who previously received definitive treatment for prostate cancer and subsequently develop detectable prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, the clinical state is known as biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. The current standard of care treatment for patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer is either surveillance or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). ADT has not been shown to provide a survival benefit in this setting, and the decision to initiate ADT will depend on patient preference and perceived risks of the disease. A non-hormonal therapy such as nivolumab would provide an alternative to ADT in patients with biomarker selected (i.e. dMMR, MSI-H, high TMB, or CDK12-altered) biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.",

    "brief_summary": "Some kidney transplant candidates have a very low chance of getting a kidney transplant because their immune systems are \"highly sensitized\" to most kidney donors. Being \"highly sensitized\" means that they will likely have to wait a long time (more than 5 years) before an acceptable donor is found for them or, they never receive a compatible donor, and die on waitlist. The purpose of this study is to find out whether two drugs, daratumumab (Darzalex\u00ae), and belatacept (Nulojix\u00ae), can make these kidney transplant candidates less sensitized, and make it easier and quicker to find a kidney donor for them.",

The study will evaluate whether the study treatment is safe and can lower the participant's immune system's sensitization to kidney donors, making it easier to find a well-matched kidney for them.\n\nThe study treatment is comprised of two drugs, Darzalex\u00ae (daratumumab) and Nulojix\u00ae (belatacept). Daratumumab is licensed for treatment of multiple myeloma and belatacept is licensed for prevention of rejection after kidney transplant. Eligible participants will receive infusions of daratumumab and belatacept over a 10-week period in Cohort 1. Eligible participants will receive infusions of daratumumab and belatacept over a 14-week period in Cohort 2. An interim safety and efficacy analysis will occur after the first 5 participants have received study treatment. All subjects will undergo HLA antibody assessments and bone marrow aspiration prior to and after completion of treatment and receive 42 weeks of follow up after completing treatment. Participants who prematurely discontinue study therapy will receive follow up through 56 weeks after their baseline visit. Subjects who receive a kidney transplant while in the study will receive standard of care immunosuppression and undergo 52 weeks of follow up.

We uniquely address this population with a highly-developed and refined exercise training program that is racially-tailored for the target population. We further provide a highly-developed and refined exercise training program that can be undertaken in one's home and/or local community, and does not require facility access that is extremely limited in the target, rural residing population of persons with MS. The program is further tailored based on qualitative research and addresses the unique needs of the African-American community with MS. There is no other research program this advanced in study refinement and design for immediate integration into a high-quality RCT for changing the lives of African-Americans with MS who reside in rural communities of the Southeastern portion of the United States. If successful, the study, as designed, will provide Class I evidence that is necessary for immediate implementation after trial completion through insurance providers and healthcare providers, including physical therapists, rehabilitation practitioners, and community health workers/providers.

    "detailed_description": "BACKGROUND Brain metastases are a common and serious complication of metastatic melanoma. Up to 50% of patients develop brain metastases during the course of their illness, and approximately 20% of patients have them at first presentation with metastatic disease. The prognosis for melanoma patients with brain metastasis is generally very poor with a median overall survival ranging from 2.8 to 4 months and a large proportion of up to 95% of these patients will ultimately die as a direct result of their brain metastases. The prognosis of patients with melanoma brain metastases has not changed between 1986 and 2007. The five year survival rate is 15% for late stage disease.\n\nLOCAL TREATMENT OPTIONS There are 3 treatment modalities used for the local management of brain metastases: surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Surgery and SRS are directed to the tumour volume only, whereas WBRT delivers lower-dose radiotherapy to the whole brain, including areas of no overt tumour. Surgery is not limited by the size of the tumour; however, it is dependent on the lesion being surgically accessible. In appropriately selected patients (lesions \\>3 cm and minimal symptoms), SRS is considered equivalent to surgical resection; however, this has been addressed in only 1 randomised controlled trial that was stopped early because of poor accrual. No statistically significant difference was found in survival or local tumour control. In solid tumours, WBRT remains the treatment modality of choice in those where surgery or SRS are contraindicated because of tumour size, number, or location. The role of WBRT is to palliate symptoms because, despite response rates of 60%, median survival is less than 5 months.\n\nSYSTEMIC THERAPY OPTIONS Systemic chemotherapy has shown little benefit in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, including those with brain metastases. It is usually reserved for those who have central nervous system (CNS) progression despite surgery and/or radiotherapy, or in those patients with rapidly progressing or symptomatic extracranial disease. The response rate in the brain for the most active chemotherapy agents temozolomide and fotemustine is \\<10% in large clinical trials, thus patients with brain metastases have been excluded from most systemic therapy clinical trials.\n\nIpilimumab was the first systemic treatment proven to extend survival in patients with metastatic melanoma, and has activity in progressing brain metastases in patients who are not taking corticosteroids for neurological symptoms.\n\nDabrafenib and vemurafenib are potent selective BRAF inhibitors proven to increase survival in patients with V600 BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma and have activity in brain metastases. Although there is unprecedented proven activity of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib in a large clinical trial of patients with untreated V600 BRAF-mutant brain metastases, this represents only 40% of the metastatic melanoma population, and responses are rarely durable. Brain metastases remain a major clinical problem, and an unmet medical need for patients with both BRAF-mutant and wild-type metastatic melanoma. And yet, all major clinical trials continue to exclude such patients.\n\nIMMUNOTHERAPY Cancer immunotherapy rests on the premise that tumours can be recognized as foreign rather than as 'self' and can be effectively attacked by an activated immune system. An effective immune response in this setting is thought to rely on immune surveillance of tumour antigens expressed on cancer cells that ultimately results in an adaptive immune response and cancer cell death. This functions by aborting the emergence of tumours as they arise and/or causing tumour shrinkage where it is present. Meanwhile, tumour progression may depend upon the acquisition of traits that allow cancer cells to evade immune surveillance and an effective immune response. This evasion may occur by exploiting any of the checkpoints that control the regulatory immune response, including the display of antigens and control of co-stimulatory pathways that affect the proliferation of cells involved in immunity. Current immunotherapy efforts attempt to break the apparent tolerance of the immune system to tumour cells and antigens by either introducing cancer antigens by therapeutic vaccination or by modulating regulatory checkpoints of the immune system - either directly by stimulation of immune cells by antibodies directed to receptors on T and B cells or indirectly by cytokine manipulation. T-cell stimulation is a complex process involving the integration of numerous positive, as well as negative, co-stimulatory signals in addition to antigen recognition by the T-cell receptor (TCR). Collectively, these signals govern the balance between T-cell activation and tolerance to antigens.\n\nNIVOLUMAB Nivolumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor PD-1 (programmed death-1 or programmed cell death-1/PCD-1) with immunopotentiation activity. The efficacy and safety of nivolumab is being explored in 3 ongoing melanoma phase 3 trials in previously treated or treatment na\u00efve patients.\n\nIPILIMUMAB In a study investigating the safety and activity of ipilimumab specifically in patients with brain metastases, ipilimumab was shown to have activity in some patients with advanced melanoma and brain metastases, particularly when metastases are small and asymptomatic and in patients who do not need corticosteroid treatment. Furthermore, the drug had no unexpected toxic effects in this population.\n\nNIVOLUMAB COMBINED WITH IPILIMUMAB Preclinical and preliminary clinical evidence suggests a synergy between nivolumab and ipilimumab. While PD-1 and CTLA-4 are both co-inhibitory molecules, evidence suggests that they use distinct mechanisms to limit T cell activation. The preliminary clinical evidence has demonstrated a higher frequency of patients with substantial tumour burden reduction for the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab. Improved overall survival associated with substantial tumour burden reduction has been noted with immunotherapies. For instance, improved overall survival has been noted in metastatic melanoma patients obtaining a complete response to IL-2. If this observation is also applicable to treatment with nivolumab combined with ipilimumab then there could also be the potential for large improvements in overall survival compared to ipilimumab.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN Initially, this study will recruit patients with melanoma brain metastases who have received no prior local treatment for their intracranial metastatic disease and who are asymptomatic (Cohort 1) and in parallel, patients who have been previously treated for their brain metastases, have symptoms, or have concurrent leptomeningeal disease (Cohort 2).\n\nCombination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab is currently under investigation in a phase III trial in previously untreated metastatic melanoma (NCT01844505). That study however excludes those patients with active brain metastases. This current study will therefore enrol a third group of patients with brain metastases who have received no prior treatment for their metastatic disease and who are asymptomatic to receive combined nivolumab and ipilimumab (Cohort 3).\n\nRecruitment to cohort 3 will commence once the first 6 patients from cohort 1 have received at least 3 doses of study treatment (equivalent to 6 weeks) and have a satisfactory adverse event record. A satisfactory record is deemed where \u2264 2 patients experience neurological CTCAE grade 3 or above nivolumab-related adverse events. Following this safety assessment, if no safety signals are detected, patients will continue to be recruited to this cohort to enable a complete patient group of 30. To minimise bias, treatment allocation to cohort 3 and the remainder of cohort 1 will be assigned by unequal randomisation ratio to achieve an overall balance of 30 patients receiving nivolumab 3 mg/kg (including the 6 patients from cohort 1) and 30 patients receiving the combination treatment. Randomisation to the remaining cohort 1 and all of cohort 3 will be stratified by participating site to minimise potential differences between patients who present to the different sites, or because of differences between the sites themselves.\n\nCONTINUED TREATMENT IN SELECT CASES OF PROGRESSIVE DISEASE Accumulating clinical evidence indicates some patients treated with immune system stimulating agents may develop progression of disease (by conventional response criteria) before demonstrating clinical objective responses and/or stable disease. enhanced inflammation within tumours could lead to an increase in tumour size which would appear as enlarged index lesions and as newly visible small non-index lesions. Over time, both the malignant and inflammatory portions of the mass may then decrease leading to overt signs of clinical improvement. Alternatively, in some individuals, the kinetics of tumour growth may initially outpace anti-tumour immune activity. With sufficient time, the anti-tumour activity will dominate and become clinically apparent. Therefore, patients will be allowed to continue study treatment after initial investigator-assessed RECIST 1.1 defined progression if they are assessed to be deriving clinical benefit and tolerating study drug.\n\nThe application of traditional RECIST criteria in patients treated with immunotherapy may lead to premature discontinuation of treatment in a patient who will eventually respond to treatment or have prolonged disease stabilization. Disease progression may occur in extracranial lesions whilst patients may continue to have disease stabilisation or response of their intracranial melanoma disease, and vice versa.\n\nINTRACRANIAL RESPONSE USING FET-PET FET PET (18F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine \\[FET\\]) will be used as a separate and independent modality to MRI brain scans to assess metabolic response of the brain metastases to immune therapy. FET PET has been extensively evaluated in humans. FET-PET has shown to be valuable in the management of brain tumours. It is not known what the effect of lymphocytic infiltration which occurs with immune therapy is on MRI brain, so it is important to have a separate modality to predict benefit and assess response. FET-PET demonstrates the change in cell proliferation (change in SUV \\[standardised uptake value\\] from baseline).\n\nFET-PET will be used to assess to determine response to study treatment. The FET PET findings will be compared with conventional imaging. Only cohorts 1 and 3 will be assessed with this modality.\n\nBLOOD AND TISSUE BIOMARKERS Blood will be collected to examine serum chemokines, cytokines, inflammatory markers, lymphocyte and T cell subsets and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) to assess correlation with disease response or progression. In patients with sufficient archival melanoma tissue from metastatic sites, a baseline tumour PD-L1 level, immune markers and genetics of response and resistance will also be measured.\n\nIf available, tumour tissue following progression of disease will also be tested for immune and genetic markers. Early work has indicated these biomarkers may be predictive of responders to study treatment. In a phase 1 study of 90 patients receiving nivolumab at different dose levels, high pre-treatment NY-ESO-1 and MART-1-specific CD8+ T cells were associated with progression of disease. At week 12, increased peripheral-blood T regulatory cells and decreased antigen-specific T cells were associated with progression. PD-L1 tumour staining was associated with responses to nivolumab, but negative staining did not rule out a response.",

    "detailed_description": "Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a diverse group of lymphoid neoplasms affecting 80,470 new cases in the USA every year.1 Among the common types of NHL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) carries a five-year survival of 64.4% (SEER). Prognosis depends on disease specific factors such as stage and extent of spread, in addition to patient specific factors, such as age and performance status. Prior studies suggest that anti-PD-1 therapy may be effective in this population, especially if there is a way to further sensitize tumor cells to anti-PD-1 therapy to reduce T-cell exhaustion and increase inflammatory cytokines. Exposure to CELMoDs in addition to anti-PD1 therapy following CAR-T relapse may lead to deeper and more durable responses through re-expansion of CAR-T cells and modulation of tumor microenvironment (TME). This trial hypothesizes that combination Golcadomide at the selected dose and nivolumab at standard dosing will be safe and effective and that an overall response rate 45% or greater with a maximum dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate of 25% would be sufficient to warrant further interest in this combination in patients who have refractory NHL after 30 days of receiving therapy.",

This study will allow an evaluation of the clinical benefit, as measured by progression free survival (PFS) \\>6 months and overall survival (OS), provided by nivolumab combined with ipilimumab.\n\nStudy Rationale Clinically advanced rare cancers pose a significant clinical challenge because evidence based treatments are seldom available for patients suffering from these malignancies. Despite little evidence that shows clinical benefit, these patients are often treated with chemotherapeutic agents that are used in patients with more common malignancies that arise from the same anatomical site. Furthermore, because of small numbers, patients are often excluded from clinical trials with newer agents. CA209-538 examined this treatment combination in three 'baskets' of rare cancers: rare upper gastrointestinal, gynaecological and neuroendocrine cancers. The cancers on study all individually had an incidence of \\<2/100000/year. The cancer specific survival of patients diagnosed with a rare malignancy is significantly lower than with common cancers highlighting the need to improve management and treatment of rare cancer patients. Given the success of cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint regulators such as ipilimumab and nivolumab in a range of different cancer types, it was postulated that these agents could be beneficial in rare cancers and improve the overall outlook of patients with these conditions. CA209-538 enrolled 120 rare cancer patients on study, clinical benefit rate was \\>30% across all baskets, long term survival follow-up is underway.\n\nThis study will enrol 240 participants, across 4 cohorts with histotypes which demonstrated clinical benefit on CA209-538.

It will enrolled 46 patients (34 in France and 12 in Australia) through 15 sites (11 in France and 4 in Australia).",
    "detailed_description": "Systemic AL amyloidosis is a rare disease caused by the deposition of misfolded monoclonal immunoglobulin free light chains (FLC) in various tissues and organs. It is usually associated with a clonal plasma cell dyscrasia with a low tumor burden. Treatment of AL amyloidosis relies mainly on chemotherapy aimed at suppressing the underlying plasma cell clone secreting monoclonal FLC.\n\nThe organ responses and the survival are greatly influenced by the degree of hematological response evaluated by the decrease in serum FLC that has been the principal endpoint in recent trials in AL amyloidosis. The goal of treatment is to reach at least a very good partial response (VGPR) defined as a difference between the involved FLC and the normal one below 40 mg/L.\n\nOver the last 5 years, monoclonal antibodies (mAb) as daratumumab and Isatuximab (anti CD38 mAb) has emerged as a breakthrough targeted therapies for patients with multiple myeloma (MM).\n\nCD38, is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that functions both as a signal-transducing receptor and a multifunctional ectoenzyme. The expression of CD38 is increased in MM and AL amyloidosis plasma cells.\n\nDaratumumab (DARA) is an IgG 1k human mAb that received initial approval as monotherapy in patients with heavily pretreated RRMM and who were refractory to proteasome inhibitors (PIs) and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD\u00ae). DARA has since been approved in combination with Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone1,2 and Bortezomib/Dexamethasone3,4 for the treatment of frontline and relapsed/refractory (RR) MM patients.\n\nIFM and other groups previously demonstrated that DARA in monotherapy is safe and effective in relapsed AL amyloidosis patients5. Our prospective phase II study showed that about 70 to 80% of patients have a response but only around 50% reached a VGPR.\n\nDARA activity could be increased with IMiD\u00ae as treating plasma cells with IMiD\u00ae, such as pomalidomide or lenalidomide, has been shown to increase the expression of CD38 levels on the surface of these cells.\n\nIn AL amyloidosis, the Italian and the British groups demonstrated that pomalidomide is very effective and better tolerated than lenalidomide especially in patients with renal insufficiency6,7. The dose of pomalidomide (4 mg) was like the dose used in MM.\n\nCombining an anti CD38 mAb to pomalidomide could therefore be an attractive regimen for relapsed AL amyloidosis patients.\n\nIsatuximab (ISA) is another IgG1 \u03ba mAb that binds selectively to a unique epitope on the human CD38 receptor and has anti plasma cells activity via multiple mechanisms of action. In a previous phase 1b study, around 65% of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma achieved an overall response with a combination of Isatuximab with Pomalidomide and low-dose Dexamethasone.\n\nThe addition of Isatuximab to Pomalidomide-Dexamethasone was used in a large phase III study in RRMM8. Safety profile was also favorable, and these results granted an approval of the combination of ISA plus Pomalidomide (4 mg) and Dexamethasone in these patients.",

    "detailed_description": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the intervention is being studied.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate effectiveness (how well the drug/s work) of Nivolumab or Nivolumab combined with Ipilimumab prior to standard of care surgery.\n\nNivolumab and Ipilimumab are types of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy works by encouraging the body's own immune system to attack cancer cells. Both nivolumab and Ipilimumab have been demonstrated to activate the immune system to attack cancer cells in laboratory studies and in patients with different types of cancers.\n\nNivolumab (Opdivo \u2122) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic melanoma (a type of skin cancer), and specific types of previously treated advanced lung and kidney cancers. Ipilimumab (Yervoy\u2122) is approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.\n\nBecause Nivolumab and Ipilimumab help the immune system work in different ways, the combination of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab was tested in laboratory studies. The data from these studies suggested that giving the two drugs together could be of benefit to patients, and this was indeed found to be the case in patients with melanoma. The combination of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab is now FDA approved as treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma. However, the use of Nivolumab as well as Ipilimumab alone or in combination for the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer is not approved. Results from clinical trials investigating the safety and efficacy of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in patients with head and neck cancer are not available at this time.\n\nIn the proposed study, either Nivolumab or the combination of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab is being tested is being tested prior to surgery to remove cancers of the oral cavity. By stimulating the immune system to attack cancer cells, these drugs may cause the cancer to decrease in size prior to surgery and prevent the cancer from coming back.",

To evaluate the efficacy (using response rate per RECIST v1.1) of nivolumab and temozolomide for the treatment of patients with either small cell lung cancer that have progressed or recurred after prior platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy (cohort 1), or progressive metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma of any grade or primary site in any line of therapy (cohort 2).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety profile and toxicity of combination nivolumab and temozolomide as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v.) 5.0.\n\nII. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients treated with combination nivolumab and temozolomide.\n\nIII. To evaluate the central nervous system (CNS) PFS of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) treated with nivolumab and temozolomide.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether treatment with nivolumab and temozolomide leads to a decrease in immune-suppressive cell populations (ie myeloid-derived suppressor cells \\[MDSC\\]) in peripheral blood.\n\nII. To determine whether objective response rate (ORR), PFS, OS vary by tumor O6-methylguanine deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation at baseline.\n\nIII. To determine whether baseline tumor mutational burden is predictive of response to therapy in patients with SCLC treated with nivolumab and temozolomide.\n\nIV. To determine whether changes in blood based mutation burden during treatment may predict clinical benefit.\n\nV. To determine whether a composite immune and tumor cell staining score can be developed with or without PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to predict response in the SCLC cohort.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 of a 28 day cycle. Patients also receive temozolomide orally (PO) on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 8 weeks for 12 months, then every 12 weeks thereafter.",

This study will evaluate whether giving intratumoral hu14.18-IL2 with radiation therapy, nivolumab and ipilimumab has antitumor activity for participants with advanced melanoma.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, every 12 weeks for up to 2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.",

Arm A explores the safety and efficacy of nivolumab alone, and Arm B explores the safety and efficacy of nivolumab plus Relatlimib. Patients with recurrent or metastatic esophagogastric cancer are eligible for this study which will enroll patients with limited disease burden and who are Programmed death-1(PD-1) therapy na\u00efve. This will allow for us to assess if systemic ablative radiation (SBRT to multiple metastatic sites plus PD-1/ anti-LAG3) is able to enhance the effectiveness of nivolumab +/- anti-LAG3 or to overcome treatment resistance mechanisms. Patients will be treated with targeted high dose radiation (SBRT) to metastatic lesions as outlined below. One of the lesions which is considered the easiest to biopsy and not causing symptoms will not be radiated so as to obtain tissue for correlative analysis. This lesion will then be re-biopsied approx. 4 weeks after the completion of radiation to the other metastatic sites. If a lesion is causing pain or other symptoms this site will not be chosen as the biopsiable site. The chosen metastatic lesion can then be irradiated at a later date if we do not see disease response in that region. Approximately 21 patients will be enrolled on study with 6 enrolled on Arm A, and 15 enrolled on Arm B.",

    "detailed_description": "This investigator-initiated randomized trial is being conducted to test whether abatacept, as compared to placebo, is associated with a reduction in MACE among participants who develop myocarditis after treatment with an ICI. Immune checkpoint inhibitors leverage the immune system to treat a wide variety of cancers. Myocarditis is an uncommon immune related adverse event (irAE) secondary to treatment with an ICI. The guideline recommended treatment for ICI myocarditis is cessation of the ICI and administration of corticosteroids. However, despite administration of corticosteroids, the rate of MACE with ICI myocarditis is high. Data from multiple independent international cohorts have shown that the rate of MACE with ICI myocarditis despite administration of corticosteroids ranges from 25-50%.For comparison, the rate of MACE with myocarditis unrelated to an ICI is \\<5%.\n\nAbatacept is a selective co-stimulation modulator that inhibits T cell (T lymphocyte) activation by binding to CD80 and CD86, thereby blocking its interaction with CD28. This interaction provides a costimulatory signal necessary for full activation of T lymphocytes. In animal studies of ICI myocarditis, the administration of abatacept led to a reduction in cardiac immune activation and an increase in survival. In retrospective unpublished clinical data, the administration of abatacept to participants with ICI myocarditis on corticosteroids was associated with a reduction in risk of MACE. There are no prospective studies testing whether abatacept is effective among participants with ICI myocarditis. Therefore, the primary aim of this trial is to test in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study whether abatacept, administered concurrently with corticosteroids, is associated with a reduction in MACE among participants with recently diagnosed ICI myocarditis",

The investigators also aim to assess participant interest in and compliance with skin antisepsis treatments. The hypothesis is that increased maternal interest will align with increased treatment compliance.",
    "detailed_description": "Few studies have assessed the clinical epidemiology of bacterial transmission among mother-infant dyads in hospitalized and community settings. In an era of rising antimicrobial resistance, the epidemiology of colonization and infections are also changing. Maternal factors account for infants' early exposure to bacteria. Maternal colonization with multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria portends a high likelihood of transmission to the infant.\n\nAs methicillin resistant Staph aureus (S. aureus) bacteria remain among the top causes of pediatric infections, the presence of these species among mothers and infants can be used to assess antimicrobial resistance, colonization and transmission in maternal-infant dyads. S. aureus is a uniquely interesting pathogen in the perinatal period. MRSA nasal colonization is a sensitive predictor of bloodstream, genitourinary and respiratory infections. Also, parental colonization with S. aureus is typically concordant with infants' colonizing and infecting S. aureus strains. In tandem, there have been numerous studies assessing the utility and impact of MRSA decolonization for high risk patients. This project creates a unique opportunity for in-depth microbiological analyses of maternal-infant dyads.\n\nDesign \\& Procedures: S. aureus skin decolonization methods have been safely tolerated in adults and children. The investigators propose a combination of intranasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine baths for a 5-day decolonization treatment targeting pregnant women already consented to participate in a longitudinal cohort - Project HOPE cohort. The investigators will aim for maternal participation in their third trimester. The decolonization regimen will include:\n\n1. Intranasal mupirocin - Participants will place a pea-sized amount (or approximately 1cm ribbon) of 2% mupirocin ointment on a cotton swab and gently massage it into the anterior nares twice daily for 5 days.\n2. Chlorhexidine baths - Participants will be instructed to use pre-packaged chlorhexidine cloths. Each cloth will be used to wipe designated body areas (i.e., arms, legs, chest and neck, back and perineum) once a day for 5 days. These are inexpensive cloths that are easy to use and have been shown to be effective at eradicating Staph aureus carriage. Ideally, participants will be instructed not to rinse off immediately after using the cloths. Baths should be performed on the same 5 days as they apply the intranasal mupirocin.\n\nEvaluation of decolonization protocol compliance: The investigators will provide verbal and printed instructions in participants' preferred languages (English or Spanish). The research team will conduct two weekly check-ins - one during the treatment week and the other during the subsequent week. The investigators will also conduct online surveys to gauge decolonization tolerance and self-reported completion rates. When plausible, participants will be asked to return the mupirocin tube at their next routinely scheduled visit to confirm appropriate use.",

Combinations of immune-oncology (IO) agents with complimentary mechanisms as well as radiation represent a promising strategy to improve response rates to immunotherapy and overcome resistance. In this phase I/Ib study, radiation will be used in combination with IO agents nivolumab and anti-IL-8 (BMS-986253) to assess toxicity by organ system and then assess the preliminary efficacy of the treatment regimen. In Part 1, the study will determine the safe doses of radiation by organ site in conjunction with nivolumab and BMS-986253. In Part 2, the treatment regimen will be investigated in melanoma, prioritizing acral melanoma, to describe the response rate to treatment as well as other clinical and safety outcomes. The study will also provide the opportunity to evaluate changes in the tumor microenvironment induced by the treatment.",
    "detailed_description": "This is a study of SBRT in combination with nivolumab and BMS-986253, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against human interleukin-8 (IL-8), conducted in humans with advanced solid tumors. This study will evaluate the safety profile, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of SBRT in combination with BMS-986253 and nivolumab in participants with advanced solid tumors and then specifically in melanoma, focused on acral melanoma. The study will be conducted in 2 parts.\n\nPart 1 will evaluate the safety, tolerability of different doses of SBRT in combination with nivolumab (480 mg) and BMS-986253 (2400mg) every 2 weeks (Q2W) in participants with advanced solid tumors. This phase will begin with a cohort of participants who will receive a 2,400 mg flat dose of BMS-986253 Q2W combined with 480 mg flat dose of nivolumab Q4W along with SBRT (the dose is dependent on the irradiating organ).\n\nPart 2 will assess preliminary efficacy of SBRT in combination with nivolumab and BMS-986253 in participants with advanced/metastatic/unresectable melanoma, focusing on acral melanoma, who progressed on anti-PD-(L)1 therapy.\n\nThis study aims to determine that safe doses will be found using ablative doses of SBRT with concurrent IO agents. Additional safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy information in specific patient population will be gathered. Twenty participants with anti-PD-(L)1 refractory advanced/unresectable/metastatic melanoma, focusing on acral melanoma, will be enrolled into efficacy phase.\n\nNote: The Sponsor-Investigator/Study Principal Investigator of this trial is Jason J. Luke, MD at the University of Pittsburgh/UPMC. The Sponsor-Investigator of this trial at University of Chicago is Steven Chmura MD, PhD",
